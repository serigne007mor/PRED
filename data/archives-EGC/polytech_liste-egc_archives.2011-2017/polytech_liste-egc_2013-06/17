  1SCOPE AND NOVELTY OF THE WORKSHOP

Data Warehouse (DW) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies 
are the core of current Decision Support Systems. Traditionally, a data 
warehouse has been a historical (and relatively static) repository of 
data collected from a wide variety of heterogeneous data sources by 
means of Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) processes. The 
widespread deployment of both DWs and OLAP technologies is due to the 
intuitive representation of data provided to data analysts or managers 
in support of management decisions. Recently, the trend is that DWs 
become more and more dynamic, with near-real-time updates, and include 
more complex types of data.

Research in data warehousing and OLAP has produced important 
technologies for the design, management and use of information systems 
for decision support. Much of the interest and success in this area can 
be attributed to the need for software and tools to improve data 
management and analysis given the large amounts of information that are 
being accumulated in corporate as well as scientific databases.

Nevertheless, the high maturity of these technologies as well as new 
data and applications needs not only demand more capacity, but also new 
methods, models, techniques, or architectures to satisfy these new needs.

Some of the hot topics in data warehouse research include distributed 
data warehouses, web warehouses, data streams, real-time data 
warehouses, GIS/location-based services, biomedical data, integration of 
semi-structured and unstructured data, security/privacy and quality 
management.

Like the previous successful DOLAP workshops, the proposed DOLAP 2013 
workshop aims at synergistically connecting the research community and 
industry practitioners. It provides an international forum where both 
researchers and practitioners can share their findings in theoretical 
foundations, current methodologies, and practical experiences. DOLAP 
will focus on new research directions and emerging application domains 
in the areas of data warehousing and OLAP.

DOLAP accepts submissions on data warehousing in a broad sense from both 
universities and industry. We are expanding topics to include work that 
bridges data warehousing and other large scale data processing 
platforms. This year, we encourage submissions from industry data 
warehouse technology developers describing technical details about their 
products as well as companies exploiting data warehousing technology 
describing case studies, experiences and technology limitations.

  4Submission Guidelines and Instructions

Contributions are invited from prospective authors with interests in the 
indicated session topics and related areas of application. All 
contributions should be high quality, original and not published 
elsewhere or submitted for publication during the review period.

Manuscripts should be formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates 
(both for MS word and Latex) available at 
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html. There are two styles 
on the website.

Both the Strict Adherence to SIGS and the Tighter Alternate style are 
allowed. Papers cannot exceed 8 pages in length for both research and 
industrial track.

Authors from industry developing data warehousing technology or 
companies exploiting data warehouses can submit a short paper (up to 5 
pages) to the industrial track.

Papers should be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair 
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dolap2013).

Papers will be reviewed by the program committee for their technical 
merit, originality, significance, readability and relevance to the 
workshop. Emphasis will be given to papers extending data warehousing to 
novel areas and applications.


  5Paper Publication

Accepted papers will appear in the DOLAP 2013 proceedings, published by 
ACM in the DOLAP series.
