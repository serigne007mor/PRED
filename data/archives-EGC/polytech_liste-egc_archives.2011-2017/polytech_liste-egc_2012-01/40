AIM & SCOPE
==========================
The 3-rd International Conference on on Emerging Intelligent Data and 
Web Technologies (EIDWT-2012) is dedicated to the dissemination of 
original contributions that are related to the theories, practices and 
concepts of emerging data technologies yet most importantly of their 
applicability in business and academia towards a collective intelligence 
approach. In particular, EIDWT-2012 will discuss advances about 
utilizing and exploiting data generated from emerging data technologies 
such as Data Centers, Data Grids, Clouds, Crowds, Mashups, Mobile 
Networks, Social Networks and/or other Web 2.0 implementations towards a 
collaborative and collective intelligence approach leading to 
advancements of virtual organizations and their user communities. This 
is because, current and future Web and Web 2.0 implementations will 
store and continuously produce a vast amount of data, which if combined 
and analyzed through a collective intelligence manner will make a 
difference in the organizational settings and their user communities. 
Thus, the scope of EIDWT-2012 is to discuss methods and practices 
(including P2P) which bring various emerging data technologies together 
to capture, integrate, analyze, mine, annotate and visualize data ? made 
available from various community users ? in a meaningful and 
collaborative for the organization manner. Finally, EIDWT-2012 aims to 
provide a forum for original discussion and prompt future directions in 
the area.

Papers should be focused on past, current and emerging methods and/or 
use of data technologies with a particular focus to collective 
intelligence. For example: Data Stream, Click stream, Cloud Computing, 
Crowd Computing, Data Annotation, Data Architecture, Data Capture, Data 
Clustering/Partitioning, Data Discovery/Management, Data Grids, Data 
Integration, Data Management and Knowledge Engineering, Data Mashups, 
Data Query Systems and Languages, Data Push/Notification, Data 
Scheduling, Data/Text Mining, P2P, Reality Mining, Data Visualization, 
Emerging Applications, Emerging/Enabling Collaborative Data 
Technologies, Trust and Security, Web Science, Web 2.0, Ubiquitus 
Intelligence, Mobile and Pervasive Computing.

EIDWT-2012 is aiming at delivering a forum for in-depth scientific 
discussions amongst the communities leading to significant contributions 
in areas such as:

  * Critical Reviews on Theory and Practices in Collective Intelligence
  * User Communities/Virtual Organizational Structures and Dynamics
  * Ad-Hoc Social Networking Analysis, Business Intelligence
  * Self-organizing Systems and Networks
  * Self-adaptive Ant Colony, Swarm and Evolutionary Agents
  * Data/Text Mining, Reality Mining, Data Clustering, Graph Partitioning
  * Group-ware, Social Networks (Web 2.0)
  * Ontology Management, Semantic Web, Web Services, Multi-Agents
  * Meta-Data, Annotation, Intra-/Inter Tagging, Inference Engines,
    Reasoning
  * Architectures, Discovery, Retrieval, Scheduling, Allocation, Monitoring
  * Enabling Technologies (Grids, P2P, Cloud, Crowds, Mash-ups, etc)
  * Data Management, Data Growth, Storage, Implications
  * Web and Ubiquitous Intelligence, Reality Mining
  * Security, Trust and Reputation, Identity Management and Privacy
  * Languages, Components, Programs, Knowledge Portals and/or Applications
  * Developments or future concepts and frameworks in various settings
    including (but not limited to) construction industry, transportation
    and other control systems, sensors, smart spaces, disaster
    management and threat detection, bioinformatics, environmental
    control, energy consumption control, business, economics,
    supply-chain management, planning and operations, etc.

==========================
PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINE
==========================
