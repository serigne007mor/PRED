CALL FOR PAPERS 
============================================================================ 

WORKSHOP ON WEB BASED AND DISTRIBUTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS (WEBDIS'12) 
                      in conjunction with 

            The 8th International Conference on 
      SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS 

        In cooperation with IEEE, IFIP, ACM SIGAPP.fr

Web based information systems present many challenges including: semantic modeling of diverse information sources, distributed information management, distributed query processing, social and community based application, and information mining. 
Applications of web based information systems range over many domains, from spatial information systems to mobile and networking services. 
Mobile web creates the need for novel applications based on a range of devices (phone, PDA, copiers) which are capable of accessing and 
processing data from multiple sources. Finally, emerging social networking services and applications allows user communities to track and 
share personal location information on the fly with mobile devices. 
The aim of WEBDIS workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss recent developments and share ideas and results in these challenging 
research domains.
