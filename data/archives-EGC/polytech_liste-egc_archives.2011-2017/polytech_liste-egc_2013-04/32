1. OVERVIEW

Information Systems are record sensitive and crucial data to support 
day-to-day company applications and decision making processes. 
Therefore, these systems often contain most of company product and 
process knowledge. Unfortunately, this knowledge is implicitly encoded 
within the semantics of the modelling languages used by the companies. 
The explicit semantics is usually not recorded in such models of 
information systems. References to ontologies could be considered as an 
added value for handling the explicit semantics carried by the concepts, 
data and instances of models Thus, developing new user Interfaces or 
reconciling data and/or models with external ones often require some 
kind of reverse engineering processes for making data semantic explicit.

Nowadays, ontologies are used for making explicit the meaning of 
information in several research and application domains. Ontologies are 
now used in a large spectrum of fields such as: Semantic Web, 
information integration, database design, e-Business, data warehousing, 
data mining, system interoperability, formal verification. They are also 
used to provide information system user knowledge-level interfaces. Over 
the last five year, a number of interactions between ontologies and 
information systems have emerged. New methods have been proposed to 
embed within database both ontologies and data, defining new 
ontology-based database. New languages were developed in order to 
facilitate exchange both ontology and data. Other languages dedicated 
for querying data at the ontological level were proposed (e.g., RQL, 
SOQA-QL, or OntOQL). Various approaches have been designed to deal with 
semantic integration of heterogeneous information sources and system 
interoperability using ontologies either in data sources or in 
mediators. In some domains, like products modelling, ontologies were 
published as standards. These ontologies are actually used to define 
world wide exchange consortiums for sharing information in various 
application domains. Due to these recent developments, most commercial 
database systems offer solution to both manage ontologies and data.


The objective of our workshop is to capitalize this effort. The aim of 
OAIS is twofold.
The first one is to present new and challenging issues in the 
contribution of ontologies for designing high quality information 
systems. The second one is to present new research and technological 
developments that use ontologies all over the life cycle of information 
systems.

3. SUBMISSION

A volume with workshop papers will be published by Springer in the 
Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing series 
(http://www.springer.com/series/11156), for distribution among workshop 
participants during the workshop. Camera-ready papers are to be prepared 
in LaTeX (detailed instructions will be provided).

The authors of the best workshop papers will be invited to prepare 
extended versions of their papers after the workshop. The extended 
papers will appear in the LNCS TLDKS Journal (Transactions on Large 
Scale Data and Knowledge-Centered Systems), which is indexed by DBLP and 
Scopus (http://tldks.faw.at).

Publication of selected papers in the journal will be subject to the 
second round of reviews (to verify if the paper satisfies the journal 
requirements, including 30% of new content compared to the version from 
the AISC proceedings). In order to qualify for the journal, the paper 
will have to be presented at the workshop by one of its authors.

Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific 
merit and relevance to the workshop. Each paper will be reviewed by at 
least two Program Committee members. Duplicate submissions are not 
allowed, i.e. submitted papers must not overlap substantially with any 
other papers of the same author(s) submitted elsewhere (i.e. journal, 
conference, workshop etc.).

Workshop papers must not exceed 10 pages in the AISC format and must 
comply with the AISC formatting guidelines available at 
http://www.springer.com/series/11156 (the link to "Instructions for 
Authors" is at the right hand side). All papers (in PDF file format) 
should be submitted electronically via EasyChair Conference Management 
System. For details please refer to submission instruction page.
