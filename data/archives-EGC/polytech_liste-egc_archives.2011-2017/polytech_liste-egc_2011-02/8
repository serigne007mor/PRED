Call For Papers: *Social Web Mining*, co-located with IJCAI, Barcelona, 
Spain, 18 July 2011
WWW: http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sguo/swm.html

***********************************************************************************************************

*Introduction*:

There is increasing interest in social web mining, as we can see from 
the ACM workshop on Social Web Search and Analysis. It is not until 
recently that great progresses have been made in mining social network 
for various applications, e.g., making personalized recommendations. 
This workshop focuses on the study of diverse aspects of social networks 
with their applications in domains including mobile recommendations, 
service providers, electronic commerce, etc.

Social networks have actually played an important role in different 
domains for about a decade, particularly in recommender systems. In 
general, traditional collaborative filtering approaches can be 
considered as making personalized recommendations based on implicit 
social interaction, where social connections are defined by some 
similarity metrics on common rated items, e.g., movies for the Netflix 
Prize.

With the recent development of Web 2.0, there emerges a number of 
globally deployed applications for explicit social interactions, such as 
Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. These applications have been 
exploited by academic institutions and industries to build modern 
recommender systems based on social networks, e.g., Microsoft's Project 
Emporia that recommends tweets to user based on their behaviors.

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in the study of social 
networks for diverse applications. For instance, researchers have 
proposed various tensor factorization techniques to analyze 
user-item-tag data in Flickr for group recommendations. Also, 
researchers study Facebook to infer users' preferences.

However, there exist many challenges in mining social web and its 
application in recommender systems. Some are:

    * What is the topology of social networks for some specific
      application like LinkedIn?
    * How could one build optimal models for social networks such as
      Facebook?
    * How can one handle the privacy issue caused by utilizing social
      interactions for making recommendation?
    * How could one model a user's preferences based on his/her social
      interactions?

We hope to gather scientific researchers and industry in order to 
discuss the challenges, exchange ideas, and promote collaborations 
across different groups.

*Topics*:

The workshop will seek submissions that cover social networks, data 
mining, machine learning, and recommender systems. The workshop is 
especially interested in papers that focus on applied domains such as 
web mining, mobile recommender systems, social recommender systems, and 
privacy in social web mining. The following list provides examples of 
the types of areas in which we encourage submissions. The following 
comprises a sample, but not complete, listing of topics:

    * Privacy in social networks
    * Preference learning or elicitation
    * Social network mining
    * Social summarization
    * Tag recommendation
    * Transfer learning
    * Web graph analysis
