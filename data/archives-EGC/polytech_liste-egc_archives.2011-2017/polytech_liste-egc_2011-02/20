##################################################################

WI 2011 provides a leading international forum to bring together
researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, to increase the
cross-fertilization of ideas and explore the fundamental roles,
interactions as well as practical impacts of Artificial Intelligence
engineering and Advanced Information Technology on the next generation of
Web systems.
Here AI-engineering is a general term that refers to a new area, slightly
beyond traditional AI: brain informatics, human level AI, intelligent
agents, social network intelligence and classical areas, such as knowledge
engineering, knowledge representation, planning, knowledge discovery and
data mining are examples. Advanced Information Technology includes
wireless networks, ubiquitous devices, social networks, data/knowledge
grids, as well as service oriented architecture, cloud computing.

Web Intelligence has been recognized as one of the most important as well
as promising direction for scientific research and development in the era
of Web and agent intelligence to bring in the next generation Web systems.

WI 2011 will be jointly held with the 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT 2011).

The two conferences will have a joint opening, keynotes, reception and
banquet.

WI-IAT 2011 will include a summer school providing in-depth background on
subjects that are of broad interest to Web intelligence and Intelligent
Agent Technology communities. It will also include workshops and an
industry day. The workshop and the industry day programs will focus on new
research challenges, initiatives and applications.

All papers accepted for workshops and industry day will be included in the
Workshop and industry day Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer
Society Press and will be available on site.

High-quality papers in all WI related areas are solicited.
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 8 pages in the IEEE
2-column format.
The same format will be used for final camera-ready papers (see the Author
Guidelines at  http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting).

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the
basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.

Note that WI 2011 will accept ONLY on-line submissions in PDF format.
Please use the Submission Form on the WI-IAT 2011 website to submit your
paper. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by
the IEEE Computer Society Press that is indexed by EI.

Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 8 pages in the
proceedings and accorded oral presentation times in the main conference.
Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 4 pages in the
proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at
the conference than regular papers.

All co-authors will be notified at all time, for the submission,
notification, and confirmation on the attendance. Submitting a paper to
the conference and workshops means that, if the paper is accepted, at
least one author should attend the conference to present the paper. The
acceptance list and no-show list will be openly published on-line. For
no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a notification.

Authors of a selected number of WI 2011 accepted papers will be invited to
submit extended and revised versions of their papers for condideration for
inclusion in Web Intelligence and Agent Systems: An International Journal
(http://wi-consortium.org/journal.html) and other related journals.

The best paper awards will be conferred at the conference on the authors
of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application paper.
Application-oriented submissions will be considered for the best
application paper award.

More detailed instructions and the On-Line Submission Form will be found
on the WI 2011 homepage:
