Overview

Similarity between objects plays an important role in both human
cognitive processes and artificial systems for recognition and
categorization. How to appropriately measure such similarities for a
given task is crucial to the performance of many machine learning,
pattern recognition and data mining methods. This book is devoted to
metric learning, a set of techniques to automatically learn similarity
and distance functions from data that has attracted a lot of interest in
machine learning and related fields in the past ten years. In this book,
we provide a thorough review of the metric learning literature that
covers algorithms, theory and applications for both numerical and
structured data. We first introduce relevant definitions and classic
metric functions, as well as examples of their use in machine learning
and data mining. We then review a wide range of metric learning
algorithms, starting with the simple setting of linear distance and
similarity learning. We show how one may scale-up these methods to very
large amounts of training data. To go beyond the linear case, we discuss
methods that learn nonlinear metrics or multiple linear metrics
throughout the feature space, and review methods for more complex
settings such as multi-task and semi-supervised learning. Although most
of the existing work has focused on numerical data, we cover the
literature on metric learning for structured data like strings, trees,
graphs and time series. In the more technical part of the book, we
present some recent statistical frameworks for analyzing the
generalization performance in metric learning and derive results for
some of the algorithms presented earlier. Finally, we illustrate the
relevance of metric learning in real-world problems through a series of
successful applications to computer vision, bioinformatics and
information retrieval.
