Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is an important agenda across ev=
ery field in the world. Language as a major part of communication should=
 be inclusive and treat everyone equally. A large internet community tha=
t uses language technology has a direct impact on people across the glob=
e. EDI are crucial to make everyone valued and include, so it is necessa=
ry to build language technology that serves this purpose. Our special is=
sue focuses on bringing together research into inclusivity of gender, ra=
cial, sexual orientation, persons with disability, and other minorities =
in language technologies with the aim to build and use datasets addressi=
ng the concerns of EDI.
The broader objective of special issue will be
=E2=97=8F To investigate challenges related to language resource creatio=
n for EDI.
=E2=97=8F To promote research in inclusive language technology.
=E2=97=8F To adopt and adapt appropriate language technology models to s=
uit EDI.
=E2=97=8F To provide opportunities for researchers from the language tec=
hnology community from around the world to collaborate with other resear=
chers to identify and bring possible solutions
to challenges of EDI.
Our special issue theme is to be more inclusive and bring researchers to=
 make language technology of more inclusive nature. We hope that through=
 these engagements we can develop language technology tools to be more i=
nclusive of everyone including marginalized people.

*Call for Papers*
Our main theme in this special issue is to bring equality, diversity, an=
d inclusivity in language technologies. We invite researchers and practi=
tioners to submit papers reporting on these issues and datasets to avoid=
 these issues. We also encourage qualitative studies related to these is=
sues and how
to avoid them. Our special issue welcomes theoretical and practical pape=
r submissions on any languages that contribute to research in Equality, =
Diversity and Inclusion. We will particularly encourage studies that add=
ress either practical application or improving resources.

*Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:*
=E2=97=8F Corpus development to include EDI
=E2=97=8F Gender inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F LGBT inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F Racial inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F Persons with disability inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F Unconscious bias and how to avoid them in language technologies
=E2=97=8F Tackling rumors and fake news about gender, racial, and LGBT m=
inorities.
=E2=97=8F Tackling discrimination against gender, racial, and LGBT minor=
ities.

*Important dates*
=E2=97=8F September 6, 2021: Paper Due Date

*Types of Papers*
FULL-LENGTH PAPERS should describe original, substantive research result=
s involving any aspect of the creation, use, or evaluation of language r=
esources, or provide a detailed description of a new and substantial maj=
or resource. In the latter case, the submission should provide a detaile=
d description of the methods used to create and evaluate the resource an=
d provide a comparison with similar resources, where appropriate. Full-l=
ength submissions are typically 18-25 pages in length.
SURVEY ARTICLES provide a comprehensive overview of some area or substan=
tial resource relevant to the LRE readership. Survey articles should be =
written with an eye toward providing an entry point for those who work i=
n the field but are not familiar with the particular area or resource, i=
ncluding context, history, and comprehensive references. Survey articles=
 follow the same format as full-length papers.

PROJECT NOTES may describe significant interim research or resource deve=
lopment results, or provide a description of software, standards, minor =
resources, or projects that are of interest to the journal's readership.=
 Project notes are typically 8-10 pages in length, but no minimum or max=
imum
length is required.
SQUIBS provides a forum for expressing an opinion on topics of interest =
to the LRE readership. We are especially interested in articles that pro=
vide a perspective and/or consider solutions or ways forward for issues =
of current interest to the field. Squibs are typically 6-8 pages in leng=
th.

*Manuscript Submission*
Submission of a manuscript implies: that the work described has not been=
 published before; that it is not under consideration for publication an=
ywhere else; that its publication has been approved by all co-authors, i=
f any, as well as by the responsible authorities =E2=80=93 tacitly or ex=
plicitly =E2=80=93 at the institute where the work has been carried out.=
 The publisher will not be held legally responsible should there be any =
claims for compensation.

*Permissions*
Authors wishing to include figures, tables, or text passages that have a=
lready been published elsewhere are required to obtain permission from t=
he copyright owner(s) for both the print and online format and to includ=
e evidence that such permission has been granted when submitting their p=
apers. Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to or=
iginate from the authors.

*Online Submission*

ght and upload all of your manuscript files following the instructions g=

ersity, and Inclusion=E2=80=9D).
