RCIS 2013 is a conference of RCIS Conference Series and is sponsored by
IEEE France section.


SCOPE AND TOPICS
The Doctorial Consortium of the Seventh International Conference on
RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION SCIENCE (RCIS 2013) aims to offer a
supportive learning opportunity for doctoral students in the early stage of
their research on Information Science related problems to discuss their
work in progress and to receive feedback and guidance from the RCIS 2013
audience. A panel of prominent professors and experts in the field of
information science will serve as mentors during the Doctoral Consortium
sessions. The conference organizers will work on ensuring that the Doctoral
Consortium is well attended and have a vibrant discussion environment.

Doctoral students that are somewhere in the middle of their research are
cordially invited to submit extended abstracts of their work and
participate in the dedicated sessions. The topics eligible for extended
abstract submissions are the same as that of the RCIS 2013 and include:

- Information System Engineering
- Requirements Engineering
 - Database and Information System Integration
- Data Management
- Information Search and Discovery
 - Software Testing
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Web Information Systems
 - Grid Computing and Cloud Computing
- Social Computing
- User Centred Approaches
 - Decision Information Systems
- Knowledge Management
- Knowledge Discovery from Data
 - Business Process Analysis, Modelling and Design
- Business Applications
 - Information Security Risk
- Information and Value Management

Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors
should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related topics are also
acceptable, provided they fit in one of the conference main topics.


AUTHOR GUIDELINES
Each extended abstract should not exceed 6 pages in length and include the
following:
- Introduce the field of research and identify the significant problems in
it
 - Clearly formulate the research questions and objectives
- Outline the current knowledge of the problem domain, as well as the state
of existing solutions
 - Sketch the research methodology that is being applied
- Introduce the proposed solution of the problem and the results achieved
so far; state in what aspects the suggested solution is different, newer or
better as compared to the existing approaches
 - Indicate the outstanding issues
- Provide a list of references.

Submissions must be single-author, written in English and adhere to the
IEEE 2-column format (see IEEE templates for conference proceedings
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html
).


SUBMISSION PROCESS
Submissions must be unpublished and must not be under review for any other
conference, workshop or journal.

The submission site address is:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drcis2013

Papers should be submitted in IEEE Xplore compliant PDF format. Please use
the IEEE PDF eXpress tool (http://www.pdf-express.org/) to convert your
source file into IEEE Xplore compliant PDF File or to check if your own PDF
file is IEEE Xplore compliant. The conference ID for IEEE PDF eXpress tool
will be provided soon on the RCIS 2013 web site. It is important to note
that submitting a file to IEEE PDF eXpress is only for creation of a
compliant PDF file, you must still submit your final paper through online
submission.

All extended abstract submissions for the Doctoral Consortium will be
formally reviewed by the RCIS 2013 Doctoral Consortium Program Committee to
ensure every accepted submission is appropriate for the consortium.


PUBLICATION
Accepted Doctoral Consortium papers will be included in the RCIS 2013
Conference Proceedings and will be published with the IEEE Conference
Publications Program through IEEE Xplore digital library.
