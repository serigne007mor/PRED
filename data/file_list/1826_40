Subject: [liste-egc] Knowledge Graphs in Action: Oct 6, 2020

Apologies for cross-posting

Dear all,
Due to current circumstances, the SEMANTiCS Onsite Conference 2020 had, 
unfortunately, to be postponed till September 2021. To bridge the gap 
until 2021, DBpedia, the Platform Linked Data Netherlands (PLDN) and 
EuroSDR will organize a SEMANTiCS satellite event online, on October 6, 
2020. We set up an exciting themed program around ‘Knowledge Graphs in 
Action: DBpedia, Linked Geodata and Geo-information Integration’. This 
new event is a combination of two already existing ones: the DBpedia 
Community Meeting, which is regularly held as part of the SEMANTiCS, and 
the annual Spatial Linked Data conference organised by EuroSDR and PLDN. 
We fused both together and as a bonus, we added a track about 
Geo-information Integration hosted by EuroSDR. For the joint opening 
session, we recruited four amazing keynote speakers to kick the event off.
