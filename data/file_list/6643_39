INVITED TALKS

Title: Meme Media and Knowledge Federation for Exploratory Visual Analytics=
 of Big Data
Invited Speaker: Prof. Yuzuru Tanaka, Computer Science Department, Graduate=
 School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University
=20
Abstract:
Our meme media research started in 1989 has been focusing on extending the =
Web since 2008 to develop a WebTop meme media system WebbleWorld, with whic=
h people can publish, retrieve and utilize all kinds of Web resources inclu=
ding Web documents, Web applications and Web services, easily extract some =
portions of these resources as meme media objects, graphically and function=
ally combine these meme media objects to compose new Web resources as compo=
site meme media objects, and republish such composite Web resources into th=
e Web, only through direct manipulations. Such a process of extracting some=
 portions of Web resources, combining them to compose new Web resources is =
denoted by knowledge federation. Improvisational knowledge federation denot=
es that such federation can be performed improvisationally by end-users onl=
y through direct manipulation of Web resources. The WebTop meme media syste=
m WebbleWorld enables improvisational knowledge federation. During the last=
 several years, our team has been involved in two kinds of practical big da=
ta analysis projects. One includes EU FP6 project ACGT (Advancing Clinico-G=
enomic Trials on Cancer) and its follow-up FP7 project p-medicine (personal=
ized medicine), where we deal with clinical trial data and patient genomic =
data. The other is a Japanese government-initiative project on social cyber=
-physical systems for the optimization on social system services, for examp=
le, snow plowing and removing services in Sapporo. These projects told us t=
hat the real worlds of such practical applications cannot be formulated by =
monolithic mathematical models. Macro analysis which simply applies the sam=
e statistical analysis or the same data mining algorithm to the whole targe=
t world may easily fail to obtain any significant result. Personalized medi=
cine which is exactly based on this observation tries to find out a specifi=
c case of patients to whom some specific candidate treatment may show signi=
ficantly better performance than the other alternatives. In general, we may=
 assume that real worlds may consist of a large number of sub worlds each o=
f which can be formulated by a rather simple monolithic mathematical model.=
 Our question is how to find out those sub worlds, i.e., subsets of objects=
. There may be two possible answers. One is to develop an advanced clusteri=
ng algorithm to automatically or semi-automatically find out those subsets.=
 The other is the exploratory visual analytics approach. Unfortunately, the=
re are no such advanced clustering algorithms that may work for our current=
 purpose. Therefore, exploratory visual analytics is currently the only sol=
ution from practical point of view in analyzing scientific big data in rese=
arch studies and urban big data in strategic operation of urban infrastruct=
ures. Exploratory visual analytics needs a large library of analysis tools =
and the capability of improvisationally federating some of these tools toge=
ther with different data sources for complex analyses. This talk shows how =
meme media and improvisational knowledge federation technologies enable the=
 development of highly interactive visual environments for exploratory visu=
al analytics.

Title: Big Graph Data Processing
Invited Speaker: Prof. Wook-Shin Han, Dept. of Creative IT Engineering/Dept=
. of Computer Science and EngineeringUniversity of POSTECH, Korea
=20
Abstract:
Graphs are used to model many real objects such as biological structures, s=
ocial networks, chemical compounds, ontologies, and web graphs. Real graphs=
 such as Facebook and Twitter have already reached a billion nodes, and we =
will soon be facing trillion-scale graphs. Many real applications in comput=
er science, bioinformatics, chemistry, physics, and health-care require eff=
icient and effective management of graph structured data. In this talk, I w=
ill first explain several key challenging issues related to big graph proce=
ssing and analytics. Next, I will introduce the iGraph framework for suppor=
ting subgraph indexing and subgraph search algorithms. Subgraph search has =
many important applications such as motif search in bioinformatics, and che=
mical compound search in chemistry, social network search, RDF query proces=
sing, and malware detection in computer science. Next, I will explain a nov=
el subgraph search algorithm called TurboISO, which significantly outperfor=
ms the state-of-the-art method. Finally, I will introduce a ultrafast disk-=
based graph analytics engine called TurboGraph, which shows ultrafast perfo=
rmance improvement over state-of-the-art distributed engines.

Bio sketch:
Professor Wook-Shin Han is currently an Associate Professor in the Departme=
nt of Creative IT Engineering and the Department of Computer Science and En=
gineering in POSTECH. Before that, he was an Associate Professor in the Dep=
artment of Computer Science and Engineering in Kyunpook National University=
. He obtained his Ph.D. from KAIST in 2001. His primary research efforts fo=
r the past 19 years have been devoted to developing new techniques in DBMS =
"engine research." He has developed an object-relational DBMS supporting mu=
ltiple language bindings. He has also developed the tight coupling technolo=
gy of DBMS with IR features. At the IBM Almaden Reserch Center, he has deve=
loped progressive query optimization in the parallel DB2 as a postdoc. He a=
lso invented the new concept of "parallelizing query optimization" for fast=
er query compilation by exploiting multi-core architecture. Recently, he ha=
s developed a framework called iGraph for comparisons of subgraph isomorphi=
sm indexing and query processing algorithms. He published at major internat=
ional journals and conferences, including SIGMOD, VLDB, SIGKDD, ICDE, WWW, =
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, and VLDB Journal. He r=
egularly serves as a PC member for VLDB, SIGMOD, and ICDE. He is currently =
an associate editor of several international journals including IEEE Transa=
ctions on Knowledge and Data Engineering and Information Sciences. He will =
serve as an industrial co-chair for ICDE 2015.
