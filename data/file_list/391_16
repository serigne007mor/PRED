CALL FOR PAPERS

   3rd International Workshop on Semantic and Conceptual Issues in GIS
   (SeCoGIS 2009)

   November 9-12, 2009, Gramado, Brazil
   Workshop Web Site: http://cs.ulb.ac.be/conferences/secogis09/

   SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP

     Recent advances in information technologies have increased the
   production, collection, and diffusion of geographical data, thus
   favoring the design and development of geographic information systems
   (GIS). Nowadays GISs are emerging as a common information
   infrastructure, which penetrate into more and more aspects of our
   society. This has given rise to new methodological and data
   engineering challenges in order to accommodate new users' requirements
   for new applications. Conceptual and semantic modeling are ideal
   candidates to contribute to the development of the next generation of
   GIS solutions. They allow to elicitate and capture user requirements
   as well as the semantics of a wide domain of applications.
     SeCoGIS is intended to bring together researchers, developers,
   users, and practitioners carrying out research and development in
   geographic information systems. The aim is to stimulate discussions on
   the integration of conceptual modeling and semantics into current
   geographic information systems, and how this will benefit the end
   users. The workshop will provide a forum for original research
   contributions and practical experiences of conceptual modeling and
   semantic web technologies for GIS, fostering interdisciplinary
   discussions in all aspects of these two fields, and will highlight
   future trends in this area. The workshop will be organized in a way to
   highly stimulate interaction amongst the participants.

   TOPICS OF INTEREST

     We invite submissions that address theoretical, technical, and
   practical topics of semantic and conceptual issues for GIS. Suggested
   topics include, but are not limited to the following:

   - Spatio-temporal ontologies
   - Spatio-temporal data modeling
   - Multi-resolution and multi-representation in GIS
   - Spatial services modeling
   - Spatial query languages and interfaces
   - Semantic GIS in environmental and urban contexts
   - Geographical search engines
   - Visualization and personalization of spatial information
   - Spatial data infrastructures, interoperability, and standards
   - Spatial data warehouses
   - Spatial data mining and statistics
   - Spatial decision making
   - Semi-structured geographic data modeling and reasoning
   - Semantic web and GIS


   SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

     SeCoGIS 2009 proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
   LNCS series. Thus, authors must submit manuscripts using the
   Springer-Verlag LNCS style for Lecture Notes in Computer Science. See
   the page http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for style files
   and details. The page limit for workshop papers is 10 pages.
   Manuscripts not submitted in the LNCS style or having more than 10
   pages will not be reviewed and thus automatically rejected. A paper
   submitted to SeCoGIS 2008 cannot be under review for any other
   conference or journal during the time it is being considered for the
   workshop.
   Submission to SeCoGIS 2009 will be electronically only. Authors are
   asked to submit an abstract first, and then to upload the full paper
   (in PDF format). The online submission system will be available from
   March 1st, 2009 at the address
   http://cs.ulb.ac.be/conferences/secogis09.
