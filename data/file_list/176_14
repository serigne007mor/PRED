       The International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSy=
stems (MEDES 2010)
                         In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
                                http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES/10/
                                     October 26-29, 2010
                                      Bangkok-Thailand

Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet, the rapid growth and exponential use of digit=
al medias leads to the emergence of virtual environments namely digital eco=
systems composed of multiple and independent entities such as individuals, =
organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several m=
issions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them=
. The digital ecosystem exhibits self-organizing environments, thanks to th=
e re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", in which resour=
ces provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The u=
nderlying resources mainly comprehend data management, innovative services,=
 computational intelligence and self-organizing platforms. Due to the multi=
-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems
and their characteristics, they are highly complex to study and design. Thi=
s also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empo=
wer digital ecosystems to be innovative and value-creating. The application=
 of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding =
of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to create benefit=
s and added-values, impacting business practices and knowledge. These techn=
ologies can be improved through novel techniques, models and methodologies =
for fields such as data management, web technologies, networking, security,=
 human-computer interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-=
organizing systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and m=
anage their resources.

The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSyste=
ms (MEDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from acad=
emia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifo=
ld challenges and issues related to resource management of Digital Ecosyste=
ms and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted t=
o this end. The conference seeks related original research papers, industri=
al papers and proposals for demonstrations.

In this call, we solicit original research and technical papers not publish=
ed elsewhere. The papers can be theoretical,
practical and application oriented on the following themes (but not limited=
 to):

- Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure

Paper Submission
----------------
Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website. Submissions should be at most 8 ACM singl=
e-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be=
 rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. =
Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originali=
ty, technical soundness, and quality of presentation. Preference will be gi=
ven to submissions that take strong or challenging positions on important e=
mergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At least one author should at=
tend the conference to present the paper.

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP.
