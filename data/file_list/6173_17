Subject: [liste-egc] [OM-2023] 1st CFP: 18th workshop on Ontology Matching
  collocated with ISWC

The 18th International Workshop on
                         ONTOLOGY MATCHING
                                 (OM-2023)
              http://om2023.ontologymatching.org/
                    November 6th or 7th, 2023,
 International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) Workshop Program,
                    M.A.I.C.C., Athens, Greece

BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler for the Semantic We=
b,
as well as a useful technique in some classical data integration tasks
dealing with the semantic heterogeneity problem. It takes ontologies
as input and determines as output an alignment, that is, a set of
correspondences between the semantically related entities of those
ontologies.
These correspondences can be used for various tasks, such as ontology
merging, data interlinking, query answering or navigation over knowledg=
e
graphs.
Thus, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data expressed
with the matched ontologies to interoperate.

The workshop has three goals:
1.
To bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions
to assess how academic advances are addressing real-world requirements.
The workshop will strive to improve academic awareness of industrial
and final user needs, and therefore, direct research towards those need=
s.
Simultaneously, the workshop will serve to inform industry and user
representatives about existing research efforts that may meet their
requirements. The workshop will also investigate how the ontology
matching technology is going to evolve, especially with respect to
data interlinking, knowledge graph and web table matching tasks.

2.
To conduct an extensive and rigorous evaluation of ontology matching
and instance matching (link discovery) approaches through
the OAEI (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative) 2023 campaign:
http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2023/

3.
To examine similarities and differences from other, old, new and emergi=
ng,
techniques and usages, such as web table matching or knowledge embeddin=
gs.


TOPICS of interest include but are not limited to:
    Business and use cases for matching (e.g., big, open, closed data);
    Requirements to matching from specific application scenarios;
    Formal foundations and frameworks for matching;
    Novel matching methods, including link prediction, ontology-based
access;
    Matching and knowledge graphs;
    Matching and deep learning;
    Matching and embeddings;
    Matching and big data;
    Matching and linked data;
    Instance matching, data interlinking and relations between them;
    Privacy-aware matching;
    Process model matching;
    Large-scale and efficient matching techniques;
    Matcher selection, combination and tuning;
    User involvement (including both technical and organizational aspec=
ts);
    Explanations in matching;
    Social and collaborative matching;
    Uncertainty in matching;
    Expressive alignments;
    Reasoning with alignments;
    Alignment coherence and debugging;
    Alignment management;
    Matching for traditional applications (e.g., data science);
    Matching for emerging applications (e.g., web tables, knowledge gra=
phs).
