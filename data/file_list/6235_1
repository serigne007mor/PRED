Subject: [liste-egc] PhD position "Graph data analysis and social sciences"
 in University Paris Sorbonne, Paris, France

Title: Graph data analysis with application to social sciences and
history

PhD: A 3-years PhD position is available at the SAMM laboratory
(http://samm.univ-paris1.fr/) of the Sorbonne university
(http://www.univ-paris1.fr), in Paris. We are looking for a dynamic
candidate with a master degree related to machine learning. Candidates
with a strong statistical background must be fluent in R (knowledge of
C/C++/Java will be appreciated). Candidates with computer science
backgrounds must be fluent in C, C++ or Java. The candidate does not
need to speak French if he/she is fluent in English. The student will be
supervised by Prof. Fabrice Rossi, in collaboration with assistant
professors of the statistical learning and networks research axis
(mainly Nicolas Bourgeois, Pierre Latouche, Madalina Olteanu and
Nathalie Villa-Vialaneix).

Salary (After payment of health insurance, taxes, and pension): from
1450€ to 1700€ depending on whether the candidate decides to give lab
sessions for students

Starting date: as soon as possible.

Contact: Fabrice.Rossi@univ-paris1.fr

Description: Because graphs are simple data structures yet capable of
representing complex systems, they are used in numerous scientific
fields from computer science to social sciences. For instance, in
biology, metabolic networks focus on representing pathways of
biochemical reactions while the regulation of genes through
transcriptional factors is described using regulatory networks.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying historical
networks which are more and more easily available via digitization of
various sources. Protohistorical networks can be inferred using material
traces: for instance amphorae tracking is used to derive commercial
exchanges between Roman or Greek antique cities, leading to a graph of
those cities, decorated by the type of exchanges between them. When
written sources are available, finer grained networks can be inferred,
especially between persons with the so called prosopographic method.
Examples of such networks studied in the SAMM laboratory include ties
between ecclesiastics and nobles in the Merovingian Gaul, feudal
contracts between peasants and nobles in the middle ages, exchanges
between Celtic cities in the fourth century BC, etc.

Those networks lead to numerous research questions including:
- how to compare different networks on a global point of view?
- how to identify local differences/resemblances between different
networks?
- how to infer missing decoration on vertices and/or edges of networks?
- how to qualify/quantify network evolution through time?
- how to compare the evolution through time of different networks?

To address those questions, we use a large body of methods ranging from
exact combinatorial algorithms to random graph models, and including non
metric data mining methods. The methodological choices of the PhD will
be adapted to the candidate, taking into account his/her background.
