Dear colleagues,

Please consider to submit your work to The 6th International Workshop on =
Intelligent Transportation and Autonomous Vehicles Technologies - ITAVT =
2023 (https://icnetlab.org/ITAVT2023/), that will be held in conjunction =
with the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium- =
NOMS2023, 08-12 May 2023 // Miami, Fl, USA  =
(https://noms2023.ieee-noms.org/).

Scope and topics of the workshop:

Designing a smart autonomous transportation system is one of the key =
factors of building safe and sustainable smart cities. In the age of =
softwarization and artificial intelligence, introducing intelligent =
transportation solutions to our cities offers various range of benefits =
including reliable and efficient traffic management in safer streets. =
Such transportation systems combined with cutting-edge vehicular and =
wireless network technologies face several unprecedented challenges. =
These include adapting vehicular cloud and network services to the =
dynamic user requirements, managing available cloud computing resources, =
big data analytics, connected vehicle network security issues, service =
composition, and power management. The aim of the Sixth International =
Workshop on Intelligent Transportation and Autonomous Vehicles =
Technologies (ITAVT) is to bring together engineers, researchers and =
practitioners interested in the intelligent transportation and vehicle =
technology advances. Participants are invited to present and discuss =
recent developments and challenges in intelligent transportation =
systems. This workshop focuses on innovative applications, software, =
tools, and frameworks in all technology areas related to connected =
vehicles in the context of networking, service management, Artificial =
intelligence, and cloud systems. Papers describing original novel work =
and advanced prototypes, systems, and tools are encouraged.

Researchers are encouraged to submit original research contributions in =
all major areas, which include, but not limited to:

*Management and Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Vehicles
*5G/6G technology for Autonomous Vehicles
*Vehicular cloud management
*SDN Autonomous Vehicles and Automated Driving
*Intelligent Infrastructure and Guidance Systems
*Security and privacy for Autonomous Vehicles
*Connected Services and Mobility management
*Green Vehicular Communication and Services
*Services Virtual Networking for Autonomous Vehicles
*Advanced driver assistance systems
*Resilient Networks and services
*Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Transportation
*Autonomous and Connected Aerial Networks
*Blockchain Systems for Autonomous Vehicles
*Communications and networking for Automated and semi-automated vehicles
*Cyber threat-free driving environment
*Congestion and awareness control in Autonomous Vehicles
*In-Vehicle Networks and Communications
*Next Generation Traffic Management Systems
*Cooperative Driving for Autonomous Vehicles
*Networking with Other Road Users
