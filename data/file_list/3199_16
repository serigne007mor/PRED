Thread-Topic: Looking for a post-doc candidate in ontology engineering and semantic Web
X-Validation-by: p_bruneau@hotmail.com
Subject: [liste-egc] Looking for a post-doc candidate in ontology
 engineering and semantic Web

Hello,

The Wimmics team is looking for a post-doc candidate in ontology engineerin=
g and semantic Web:

This post-doc position is in the context of a new collaboration between Inr=
ia and Stanford and more precisely the laboratory in Stanford providing the=
 most well-known and widely used open-source schema editor called Prot=C3=
=A9g=C3=A9 and the Wimmics team at Inria providing the open-source semantic=
 factory CORESE.
A common interest was identified for "Verifying the quality of ontologies" =
and combining the skills on supporting ontology design from Prot=C3=A9g=C3=
=A9 group at Stanford with the skills on semantic Web data processing from =
the Wimmics team and with a special application case to medical and healthc=
are data and in particular to their schemata/ontologies.
The candidate will investigate the extension of the structure-oriented SHAC=
L validation to include more semantics, and to support ontology validation =
and the modularity and reusability of the associated constraints.

Online application is here:
https://jobs.inria.fr/public/classic/en/offres/2019-02099

Best regards,
--=20
