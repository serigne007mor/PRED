CALL FOR PAPERS: Information Systems Special Issue on Cloud Intelligence
************************************************************************

http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/cloud-i/?page_id=3D243

With the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud business intelligence=
 "as a service" offerings have arisen, both from cloud start-ups and major =
BI industry vendors. Beyond porting BI features into the cloud, which alrea=
dy implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL database modeling and stora=
ge, data localization, data marketplaces, security and privacy, performance=
, cost and usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges =
for making data analytics available to small and medium-size enterprises (S=
MEs), non-governmental organizations, web communities (e.g., supported by s=
ocial networks), and even the average citizen. This vision requires new int=
egration and deployment models. For example, some deployments would benefit=
 from an integrated database of private and open data.=20

Following the Cloud-I workshop at VLDB 2012 (http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/clou=
d-i/), the aim of this special issue of Information Systems is to attract t=
he best papers related to the emerging field of Cloud Intelligence, with re=
spect to the non-exhaustive list of topics below.
