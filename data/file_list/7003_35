from industry and the public sector. PoEM is a very interesting and dynamic
event. Submissions are sought on any topic of enterprise modelling,
including, but not limited to:

- Enterprise modelling approaches and tools for agility and flexibility
- Enterprise architecture
- Change management and transformation
- Enterprise modelling and information systems
- Enterprise modelling and requirements
- Quality of enterprise models
- Conceptualizations, notations, and ontologies
- Enterprise modelling and business processes
- Compliance in enterprise modelling
- Capability-driven development of enterprise information systems
- Use of enterprise models at run-time
- Enterprise modelling and model-driven development
- Economics of enterprise modelling
- Multilevel modelling
- Enterprise modelling
- Use cases and action research on enterprise modelling

*CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS*
Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review for
other conferences or journals will not be considered for publication at
PoEM 2015. Authors are invited to submit papers in English. Each submitted
paper will have to be associated to one of the four following categories:
=E2=80=A2 Research papers - describe original research contributions to the=
 area of
EM (max. 15 pages).
=E2=80=A2 Experience papers - present problems or challenges encountered in
practice, relate success and failure stories, or report on industrial cases
and practices (max. 15 pages).
=E2=80=A2 Practitioner papers - may address any aspect of EM or enterprise

=E2=80=A2 Short papers - can be used to present work in progress and emergi=
ng EM
challenges. That includes presentation of on-going thesis or research work
by PhD or Master students (max. 10 pages).

*We are happy to announce that Larry Constantine will be delivering a
keynote in PoEM 2015!*

*Missing Models: Understanding Human Activity in the Enterprise *

*Larry Constantine *
*Institute Fellow, Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute *
*Professor Emeritus, University of Madeira *

Enterprise modeling has made great strides in recent decades in providing
tools for modeling business processes, information and material flows, and
management of enterprise resources, among others. Theory and practice have
lagged, however, in building better understanding of a crucial aspect of
the enterprise: human activity as broadly conceived as it takes place in
the workplace. This keynote will introduce recent advances and extensions
to human activity modeling and will argue for potential benefits from
modeling human activity within and across the enterprise.

Larry Constantine, is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery
and a Life Member of the Industrial Designers Society of America. An
award-winning designer and author, he has more than two dozen books and
over two hundred papers published, including Software for Use (co-authored
with Lucy Lockwood), winner of the Jolt Award. He is the recipient of the
Stevens Award for his pioneering work in software engineering, including
the invention of data-flow diagrams and the concepts of coupling and
cohesion. Under his pen name, Lior Samson, he is the author of eight
novels, including Bashert, a 2015 winner of the Hoffer Award, and most
recently, Flight Track (Gesher Press, 2015).
