CONCEPTS 2024
1st International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures

28th Intl. Conf. on Conceptual Structures (ICCS)
18th Intl. Conf. on Formal Concept Analysis (ICFCA)
17th Intl. Conf. on Concept Lattices and their Applications (CLA)

September 9–13 2024, Cádiz, Spain

Website: https://concepts2024.uca.es
Email contact address: concepts24@lists.cs.uni-kassel.de

The 1st International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge 
Structures (CONCEPTS) is a merger of the three conferences CLA, ICCS, 
and ICFCA, which have been essential venues for researchers and 
practitioners working on theoretical and applied aspects of formal 
concept analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge, as well as 
closely related areas, such as data mining, information retrieval, 
knowledge management and discovery.

This new conference aims to continue the tradition and standards of 
previous conferences and become a key annual meeting to take along all 
members of the three communities of CLA, ICCS, and ICFCA and to keep 
abreast of the advances and new challenges in the field.

Main topics include but are not limited to:

- Formal concept analysis: concept lattices, implications, algorithms 
and computational complexity
- Conceptual graphs, graph-based models for human reasoning
- Knowledge spaces and learning spaces
- Ontologies, semantic web, knowledge graphs
- Conceptual structures in natural language processing and linguistics
- Conceptual knowledge acquisition and management
- Conceptual knowledge discovery, data analysis, and visualization
- Probabilistic approaches to conceptual knowledge representation and 
knowledge discovery
- Approximation techniques in application to conceptual structures
- Bridging conceptual structures to information sciences, artificial 
intelligence, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, 
database theory, software engineering, and other areas of computer science
- Understanding real-world data and modeling real-world phenomena with 
conceptual structures

Submission details:

Submissions are invited on significant, original (previously 
unpublished) research on the topics of the conference. All accepted 
submissions will be refereed, by following three different modalities: 
journal track papers, up to 26 pages, to be published in a special issue 
of a high-rank international journal; regular papers up to 16 pages, and 
short papers up to 8 pages, to be published by Springer in the LNAI 
series as a proceedings volume.
All submissions will be subject to single-blind peer review. Accepted 
papers have to be presented at the conference on-site. Therefore, at 
least one author per paper has to register timely and attend the 
conference on-site.

Important dates:

For journal track submissions:
- Submission deadline: March 6, 2024
- Paper Reviews Sent to Authors: May 3, 2024
- Revised submission: June 3, 2024
- Notification of acceptance: June 30, 2024

For regular papers and extended abstracts:
