Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Workshop on Security and Privacy Preserving in
 e-Societies - Lebanon

              ################## Sorry for cross-postings ##################


---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------

The 1st International Workshop on Security and Privacy Preserving in e-Soci=
eties (SeceS'11)
                  In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP.fr and ACM SIGAPP (pending)
                                 Antonine University-Lebanon
                                     June 9-10, 2011
                                 http://seces.upa.edu.lb



Description
------------
Recently information technologies have invaded almost every aspect of our m=
odern life.
The effects of the World Wide Web and more recently Web 2.0, computers, and=
 telecommunications on societies have emerged to cover new form of social c=
yberspace as reference to digital society or e-Society.
In fact, the e-Society is the result of an emerging era of digitalizing dif=
ferent forms of multimedia information making time and space compression a =
constant evolving task.
E-Society represents a revolutionary change in the way people interact with=
 each others=ED beyond countries boundaries. It provides individuals, such =
as end-users and organizations,
the ability to easily share and publish corporate data, visions, and strate=
gies.
Nonetheless, with this emerging social interaction and the wide range of sh=
ared data,
several privacy and confidentiality concerns arise. Mechanisms used to harv=
est social information represent a privacy threat for users in many situati=
ons and such concerns fall beyond security administrators=ED duties and tar=
get end-users in their daily tasks.

Approaches proposed in the literature to provide safe data publishing have =
several drawbacks related,
on one hand, to the heterogeneous types of data addressed, and, on the othe=
r hand, to complexity in
specifying privacy and security rules.


Topics
-------

The aim of the 1st International Workshop on Security and Privacy Preservin=
g in e-Societies is to pin down the latest techniques, studies, and approac=
hes related to security and privacy preserving in the
digital society in the following (but not limited) topics:

    * Access control
    * Content protection
    * Data protection
    * Database security
    * Data association detection
    * Data integrity
    * Information hiding
    * Inference detection
    * Inference elimination
    * Knowledge discovery and privacy
    * Multimedia mining threats
    * Multimedia security
    * Multimedia privacy
    * Multimedia hiding
    * Network security
    * Network intrusion detection
    * Quantifying threat
    * Social networks security
    * Social networks privacy preserving
    * Security and privacy policies
    * Security metrics
    * Secure cloud computing
    * Watermarking and steganography
    * Wireless and mobile security

Accepted papers will be published by ACM and fully indexed by ACM Digital L=
ibrary and DBLP (pending).
