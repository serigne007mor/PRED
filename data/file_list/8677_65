AIM AND SCOPE

The "European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of
Knowledge Discovery in Databases" (ECML/PKDD) includes a PhD session on
machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases and related
application domains.  The objective of the session is to provide an
environment for students to exchange in an interactive atmosphere their
ideas and experiences with peers and to get constructive feedback from
senior researchers in machine learning, data mining and related areas.

The topics for discussion will be ideas of students and their ongoing
work in preparation of their PhD dissertations and their interests in=20
machine learning and data mining. The target audience for the
session is mainly PhD students, their advisors, and interested researchers=
=20
and attendees of ECML/PKDD. During the PhD session, researchers with=20
experience in supervising and examining PhD students will be able to=20
participate and provide feedback and advice to participants. It
will be an excellent opportunity for developing person-to-person networks
to the benefit of the community and PhD students in their future careers.


CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite PhD students (PhD in progress or defended not earlier than 31st
December 2013) interested in machine learning and/or knowledge discovery in
databases, to submit papers on all aspects of machine learning, knowledge
discovery and data mining, including real-world applications. Research
fields in which machine learning and data mining benefit from
cross-fertilization are welcome.

The submissions need to propose research ideas that are mature enough to be
presented as a paper and whose content can evolve to become a substantial
part of a PhD dissertation. The work may be in progress. Papers submitted to
the PhD session may include the following items:
Motivation, problem description
Background and related work (including key references)
Novelty and significance relative to the state of the art
Approach, data, methods and proposed experiments
Results obtained and work in progress
Specific research issues for discussion at the PhD session

The first author must be a PhD student or a Masters student with a
concrete PhD research idea. Co-authors may include the research advisors,
committee members and other collaborators as needed.

Papers submitted to ECML/PKDD 2014 PhD session will be peer-reviewed.
Accepted papers will be presented in the special PhD session at ECML/PKDD
2014 and will be published in the session proceedings which will be
available through the conference website. The PhD student must register for
the conference and give an oral presentation at the PhD session.


SUBMISSION

All aspects of the submission and notification process will be handled
online via the CMT conference management toolkit. The papers must be
written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNAI
guidelines. Authors instructions and style files can be downloaded at:
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
