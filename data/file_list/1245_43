SEE-MAS 2010
============
THE SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPEAN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS SUMMER SCHOOL

http://see-mas2010.cs.pub.ro/

FACULTY OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND COMPUTERS
University “Politehnica” of Bucharest, Romania
5-10 July, 2010


The SEE-MAS 2010 Summer School aims to enhance postgraduate and PhD students' knowledge in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS) and to boost their
research skills, during tutorials presented by outstanding researchers in the field. The participants will have the opportunity to learn about
the most relevant topics of MAS, modern perspectives and underlying technologies, and to identify the pertinent issues that form new directions of research.

The participating students will be able to gain a range of theoretical and practical skills necessary to develop complex, real-life agent based applications.

The topics include, but are not limited to: logical foundations of multi-agent systems, alternating-time temporal logics, automated negotiation,
multi-agent planning and coordination techniques, multi-agent systems for B2B interoperability, trust and reputation in MAS, software agents for the Grid.

Moreover, the Organizing Committee of the SEE-MAS 2010 encourages young researchers to share their work and research results with their colleagues and
receive feedback from leading researchers in the field of multi-agent systems. All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and will appear in
the online proceedings of the Student paper workshop; the selected papers will be presented in a conference-like setting, on Friday, the 5th of July.

We invite you to participate in all these activities, as well as in the organized social events, which include evening gatherings, a musical event and
a trip in the beautiful mountain area of Bucegi.

A limited number of scholarships are available, with priority given to applicants from South-Eastern European and Balkan countries.

The first edition of the South Eastern European Multi-Agent Systems Summer School is organized by
the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems (AI-MAS) of the Department of Computer Science, UPB, and
the IEEE Romania Section Computational Intelligence Society Chapter.

SEE-MAS 2010 will be hosted by the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers of UPB, one of the most important centers for education and research
in IT technology, in Romania, with the support of SEE-MAS sponsors.
