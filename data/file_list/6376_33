                          ---------------

******************************************************************************
THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCES (SLDS 
2015)

April 20-22, 2015

Royal Holloway, University of London, UK

http://www.clrc.rhul.ac.uk/slds2015/ [1]

******************************************************************************

AIMS:
----
Great progress has been made in the past 20 years in Machine Learning 
and Statistical Learning, Data Analysis and Data Mining.
 From the statistical analysis of data to data mining, from machine 
learning to knowledge discovery, the development of data exploration and 
modelling has overcome numerous challenges and has benefited greatly 
from varied, often overlapping, paradigms.

By uniting specialists with different expertise and from different 
disciplines, the objectives of this conference are to compare approaches 
to data, to deepen understanding of different methodologies, and to 
focus on the Grand Challenges that must be addressed in the coming 
years.

The 3rd Symposium builds on the core contributions to Data Science made 
by SLDS 2009 and SLDS 2012. The 3rd Symposium focuses on contemporary 
and theoretical problems as well as on efficient practical solutions for 
applied domains which involve Data Analysis, Data Mining, Machine 
Learning and Statistical Learning contributions.

This Symposium is important for researchers and all who want to keep 
abreast of developments in data handling and of the consequent results 
that can be imagined in various applied domains.

SCOPE:
------
The focus of the Symposium includes, but is not limited to, the 
following themes:

    - Machine Learning Algorithms with Performance Guarantees
    - Conformal Predictors
    - Prediction with Expert Advice

    - Machine Learning for Big Data
     - Data Science
    - Complex/Symbolic Data Analysis
    - Visualisation and Verbalisation of Data
    - Deep Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning
    - Data Mining and Cluster Analysis
    - Knowledge Discovery by Modelling

    - Text Mining and Social Networks
    - Textual Analysis and Analysis of Semantics
    - Aspects of Knowledge Structures
     - Computational Finance
    - Geometric Data Analysis
    - Open Linked Data
    - Smart Cities
    - Forensics and Security

for publication elsewhere.

The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, 
name,affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The 
first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a 
maximum of 5 topical keywords and an abstract with no more than 150 
words.

Submitted papers will be refereed by at least two reviewers in the field 
for originality, significance, clarity, and technical soundness.

Notification and reviews will be communicated via email.
