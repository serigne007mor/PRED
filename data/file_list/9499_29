ions on mobile devices. Other major topics of the workshop include but are =
not limited to the following:

    * Data mining on media rich platforms and immersive environments (on-li=
ne communities, blogs, social networks, virtual communities, virtual worlds=
).
    * Mining large datasets of user generated content (e.g., YouTube, Flick=
r, etc.).
    * Multimedia data mining across platforms, including web and mobile dev=
ices.
    * Emerging technology of data mining for mobile applications.
    * Predictive and prescriptive multimedia data modeling.
    * Privacy preserving data mining.
    * Mining multimedia time series.
    * Multi-objective multimedia data mining.
    * Anomaly and outlier detection in multimedia databases.
    * Merging and integration of mining results from different sources (e.g=
, ensembles, fusion techniques, etc.).
    * Scalable data mining techniques for large-scale multimedia databases.
    * Human-computer interfaces for multimedia data mining.
    * Topic and event discovery in large multimedia repositories.
