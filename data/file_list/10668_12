                      CALL FOR PAPERS
======================================================================

              The 9th International Conference on
 SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS (SITIS'13)
                  December 2 - 5, 2013

      In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP French Chapter and
      IEEE Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing

                 Kyoto Terrsa, Japan

             http://www.sitis-conf.org/

======================================================================

The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used
to represent, share and process information in various forms, ranging
from signal, image, and multimedia data to traditional structured data
and semi-structured data found in the web.

SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that increasingly play
a key role in connecting systems across network centric environments
to allow distributed computing and information sharing.

SITIS 2013 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on
research activities centered on three main tracks:

- The first track titled "Web Computing and Applications (WeCA)"
focuses on emerging and novel concepts, architectures, technologies,
and methodologies for information management related to the Web and
cloud computing. In essence, the Web, with its different versions,
has created an interconnected world in which information can be
exchanged easily, tasks can be processed collaboratively, communities
of users with similarly interests can be formed to achieve efficiency
and improve performance, etc. Taking full advantage of these
interconnected environments to meet the ever increasing needs of
emerging applications requires solutions that address new issues
and challenges.  The track calls for research papers
and reports directed at several areas including: Data Semantics,
Web-Centric Systems, Big Data, Information System Interoperability,
Cloud, Cooperative information and Distributed Systems, and
Information security

- The second track titled "Signal & Image Technologies (SIT)" focuses
on recent developments in digital signal processing and pays particular
attention to evolutions in audiovisual signal processing, analysis,
coding and authentication, and retrieval techniques.
The track calls for research papers and reports directed at several
areas including:Image Processing and Analysis, Signal processing,
Image/Video Coding and Authentication, and Applications

- The third track titled "Multimedia Information Retrieval and Application (MIRA)"
focuses on emerging modeling, representation and retrieval techniques
that take into account the amount, type and diversity of multimedia
information accessible in distributed computing environment.
The internet, social networking, multimedia databases and management
of multimedia cultural collections have created the need for cross-fields
models, paradigms and techniques for efficient modeling, management and
consumption of multimedia contents. The track calls for research papers
and reports directed at several areas including
Multimedia Query and Retrieval; Mobile and Location-Based Media,
Social media and Social networking, Multimedia Security, and
Multimedia Arts, Entertainment and Digital Culture.


Submission and publication
--------------------------

The conference will include keynote addresses, tutorials, and regular
and workshop sessions. SITIS 2013 invites submission of high quality
and original papers on the topics of the major tracks described below.

All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for
technical merit, originality, significance and relevance to track topics.

Papers must be up to 8 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication format.
Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published
by IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major indexes.

Special issues and Journal Publication
---------------------------------------

Extended versions of the selected papers will be published in one of the following reviewed journals.

- World Wide Web Journal (WWW)
- Multimedia Tools and Applications journal (MTAP)
- Journal of Complex Networks (JCN)
