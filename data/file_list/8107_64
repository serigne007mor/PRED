SCOPE

Research in Data Mining and Machine Learning has progressed 
significantly in the last decades, through the development of advanced 
algorithms and techniques. In the past few years there has been a 
growing attention to the development of languages for use in data mining 
and machine learning. Such languages provide common buildings blocks and 
abstractions, and can provide an alternative interface to advanced 
algorithms and systems that can greatly increase the utility of such 
systems. The workshop main motivation is the believe that designing 
generic and declarative modeling languages for data mining and machine 
learning, together with efficient solving techniques, is an attractive 
direction that can boost scientific progress.

The workshop promotes work that goes beyond one particular subfield of 
machine learning or data mining. It promotes cross-fertilisation between 
computer language oriented research, across data mining and machine 
learning. The workshop encourages submissions inspired from other 
scientific disciplines such as logic in knowledge representation, query 
languages in databases, modeling languages in constraint solving and 
other formalisms such as mathematical programming.


CALL FOR PAPERS

LML workshop solicits papers on all aspects of the following 
non-exclusive list of topics:
- Language constructs and abstractions for expressing
   mining/learning tasks
- Query languages for data mining
- Modeling languages for data mining/machine learning
- Declarative approaches to data mining/machine learning
- Language integration of databases and data mining systems
- Frameworks for supporting higher-level ML/DM languages
- Scalable and/or distributed computation of ML/DM language
   constructs
- Compilation/transformation/interpretation of high-level
   languages to existing ML/DM algorithms
- Domain specific languages for classes of mining and learning
   problems
- Logic as a language for data mining/machine learning
- Constraint-based languages for data mining/machine learning
- High-level (declarative) languages for data mining and machine
   learning problems
- Probabilistic programming languages for data mining and machine
   learning
- Domain-specific languages for ML/DM applications
- Integration of logic and/or statistics in languages,
   for use in data mining/machine learning
- Generic languages and their integration with mining/learning
   techniques Learning-based programming languages

Our main goal is to stimulate discussion, collaboration
and the sharing of experiences.
In that respect, we would have three submission types:
1) unpublished works (max 15 pages in LNCS format),
double submissions allowed
2) extended abstracts and vision statements (max 4 pages)
3) recently published works (special oral-only track, no page limits)

For more details on submission, see the LML webpage at
http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/lml/


IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for submissions:      28th June, 2013
Author notification:           19th July, 2013
Final version:                 2nd August, 2013
Workshop date:                 23rd September, 2013
