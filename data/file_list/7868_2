AIM & SCOPE
==========================
The 3-rd International Conference on on Emerging Intelligent Data and 
Web Technologies (EIDWT-2012) is dedicated to the dissemination of 
original contributions that are related to the theories, practices and 
concepts of emerging data technologies yet most importantly of their 
applicability in business and academia towards a collective intelligence 
approach. In particular, EIDWT-2012 will discuss advances about 
utilizing and exploiting data generated from emerging data technologies 
such as Data Centers, Data Grids, Clouds, Crowds, Mashups, Mobile 
Networks, Social Networks and/or other Web 2.0 implementations towards a 
collaborative and collective intelligence approach leading to 
advancements of virtual organizations and their user communities. Thus, 
the scope of EIDWT-2012 is to discuss methods and practices (including 
P2P) which bring various emerging data technologies together to capture, 
integrate, analyze, mine, annotate and visualize data made available 
from various community users in a meaningful and collaborative for the 
organization manner. Finally, EIDWT-2012 aims to provide a forum for 
original discussion and prompt future directions in the area.

EIDWT-2012 is aiming at delivering a forum for in-depth scientific 
discussions amongst the communities leading to significant contributions 
in areas such as:

  * Social Networking and Mining
  * Natural Inspired Computing for Collective Intelligence
  * Groupware and Online Campuses
  * Ontologies and Metadata Representation
  * Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
  * Databases and Data Warehouses
  * Data Security, Trust and Reputation
  * Web Science and Business Intelligence
  * Data Management and Information Retrieval
  * Data Modelling, Visualisation and Representation Tools
  * Data Centers and Cloud Computing
  * Data Centers and IT irtualization Technologies
  * Web Science and Business Intelligence
  * Machine Learning on Large Data Sets and Massive processing
  * Natural Inspired Computing for Emerging Intelligence
  * Data Sensing, Integration, Querying
  * Management of Big Data in Clouds
  * Ubiquitous Intelligence and Reality Mining
  * eScience data sets, repositories, digital libraries and infrastructures
  * Energy-aware and Green Computing in Data Centers
  * Emerging Trends and Innovations in Data Technologies

Proceedings of the EIDWT-2012 will be published by IEEE Conference 
Publishing Service (IEEE CPS), and submitted for indexing through 
INSPEC. Produced by the IET1, INSPEC is the leading English-language 
bibliographic information service providing access to the world`s 
scientific and technical literature in physics, electrical engineering, 
electronics, communications, control engineering, computers and 
computing, and information technology. If interested, you can learn more 
about INSPEC at http://www.iee.org/publish/inspec. All CPS conference 
publications are also submitted for indexing to EI's Engineering 
Information Index, Compendex, (Elsevier) , and ISI Thomson's Scientific 
and Technical Proceedings, ISTP/ISI Proceedings, and Current Contents on 
Diskette (ISI Thomson). For more information on the indexing services, 
visit the Conference Publishing Services page. Conference proceedings 
are also submitted for indexing to DBLP Bibliography. Presented papers 
at EIDWT-2012 will be considered for publication in several Special 
Issues in International Journals:

  * Journal of Internet Technology (JIT) (SCI Indexed)
  * Inderscience, International Journal of Sensor Networks (IJSNet) (SCI
    Indexed)
  * International Journal of Virtual Communities and Social Networking
