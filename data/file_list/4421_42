Summer School on Artificial Intelligence Technologies
for Trust, Interoperability and Autonomy in Industry 4.0

27th to 31st July 2020, Saint-=C3=89tienne, France
web site: http://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/ai4industry

Please read carefully our plan to manage potential travel restrictions
The summer school will take place in late July in France, when a strong=20
improvement in the situation related to Covid-19 is foreseen. However,=20
in case some countries still have restrictions on travelling, we will=20
propose an innovative ***on-line/off-line participation*** allowing=20
participants to remotely attend the keynotes and courses, and to realise=20
the practical exercises by accessing services that are deployed in=20
factories running in three sites (Nuremberg (Germany),=C2=A0 Saint-=C3=89=
tienne=20
(France), St Gallen (Switzerland)). Students will participate to the=20
deployment of distributed and decentralized connected Industry 4.0.

We invite PhD students and researchers from academia or industry to=20
participate in the summer school we are organizing in Saint-=C3=89tienne =
from=20
the 27th to the 31st of July 2020 on the theme of Artificial=20
Intelligence (AI) technologies for trust, interoperability and autonomy=20

Topics
The teachings and practical applications of this summer school will=20
cover the following areas:

Each of these topics will be addressed through lectures and sessions=20
that provide an overview of the state of the art and theoretical=20
foundations. Practical sessions applied to concrete case studies from=20
the industry will enable the design of innovative solutions mobilizing=20
this knowledge and integrating various aspects of AI.


Participants, whether academic or industrial actors (PhD students,=20
researchers, engineers), should have knowledge in at least one of the=20
above topics, with the desire to broaden their perspective and have the=20
opportunity to apply their skills to real problems. They will thus be=20
able to:

* get in touch with top researchers and professors
* network with other talented researchers from academia and industry
* implement solutions in relation to industry problems
