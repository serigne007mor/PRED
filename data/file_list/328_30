About this book
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Statistical implicative analysis is a data analysis method created by
R=E9gis Gras almost thirty years ago which has a significant impact on a
variety of areas ranging from pedagogical and psychological research to
data mining. Statistical implicative analysis (SIA) provides a framework
for evaluating the strength of implications; such implications are
formed through common knowledge acquisition techniques in any learning
process, human or artificial. This new concept has developed into a
unifying methodology, and has generated a powerful convergence of
thought between mathematicians, statisticians, psychologists,
specialists in pedagogy and last, but not least, computer scientists
specialized in data mining.
This volume collects significant research contributions of several
rather distinct disciplines that benefit from SIA. Contributions range
from psychological and pedagogical research, bioinformatics, knowledge
management, and data mining.

Written for:
