scientific research and/or innovations relevant to the topics of the 
conference. Submissions must be original and must not have been 
submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must follow the guidelines 
given in the author instructions, including references and optional 
appendices. Each submission will be reviewed by several PC members who 
will judge it based on its innovativeness, appropriateness, and impact 
of results in terms of effectiveness at solving real problems.

The Posters and Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in 
progress, late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller 
contributions in all fields related to the Semantic Web and Linked Data 
in a broader sense. These include submissions on innovative applications 
with impact on end users, such as demos of solutions that users may test 
or that are yet in the conceptual phase but are worth discussing, and 
also applications or pieces of code that may attract developers and 
potential research or business partners.

= Important Dates:
* Paper Submission Deadline:                June 22, 2020 (11:59 pm, 
Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance:                 July 22, 2020 (11:59 pm,

== Industry and Use Case Track ==
Focusing strongly on industry needs and ground breaking technology 
trends SEMANTICS invites presentations on enterprise solutions that deal 
with semantic processing of data and/or information. A special focus of 
Semantics 2019 will be on the convergence of machine learning techniques 
and knowledge graphs. Additional topics of interest are Enterprise 
Knowledge Graphs, Semantic AI & Machine Learning, Enterprise Data 
Integration, Linked Data & Data Publishing, Semantic Search,

project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased 
visibility. The workshops and tutorials will provide a forum for 
presenting widely recognised contributions and findings to a diverse and 
knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a 
dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a 
closed format for research and commercial project consortia meetings.

sufficient amount of high quality submissions these topics will become 
special tracks within the conference program. For 2020 SEMANTiCS 
Amsterdam encourages submissions to the following sub-topics:

* Special Sub-Topic: Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage
* Special Sub-Topic: LegalTech
* Special Sub-Topic: Blockchain and Semantics

Each sub-topic is managed by a distinct committee and encourages 
submissions from the scientific or industrial domain. Scientific 
submissions will undergo a thorough review process and will be published 
in the conference proceedings in case of acceptance. Industrial 
submissions will be evaluated and selected according to the quality 
criteria of the industry track. We are looking forward to your submissions!
