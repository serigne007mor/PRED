**Call for Papers
Workshop on Complex Data Mining in a Geospatial Context
24 april, 2012
**
*  <http://sites.google.com/site/cdmgsc2012>http://sites.google.com/site/cdmgsc2012


*Important dates*
Submission deadline: 2 march, 2012 (23:59 EDT)
Author notification: 12 march, 2012
Camera-ready submission: 28 march, 2012
Conference dates: 24 april, 2012

*Theme*
In many fields, such as geodatabases, geographical web semantic,
and of course in GIS, the amount of available data grows larger
every day. Therefore, this often leads us to handle data:
(i)   from multiple sources such as sensors, or web research and survey;
(ii)  representing the same information (location, territory, land)
       at different dates (periods of time);
(iii) grouping information from different types (images, texts, coordinates,
       shapes,...) or of different natures (web, ontology,...), etc.

In the geospatial context, the complexity may concern the processes
(data acquisition, data structuring, knowledge discovery)
or the data theirselves (lack of information, uncertain data, serial data, etc.).
Therefore, complex data mining in a geospatial context should structure
complex data before extracting geopatterns.
The consideration of the data mining step from the preprocessing
to the utility of the extracted geopatterns is one of the workshop goals.

*Workshop and main conference*
This workshop would be a framework for collaboration between
researchers/industrialists in order to share their practices *
in the field of complex data mining for geoapplications.
This workshop will be hosted by the Conference AGILE in Avignon (France).

*Scope*
Original papers are solicited from all areas of study of complex data
mining in spatial/geographic application. Among the typical areas are
complex geodata preprocessing and structuring, spatiotemporal data mining
methods and processes, clustering, learning and merging of multi-sources
and distributed data in geoapplications, experiment feedback from knowledge
data discovery from complex data in a geospatial context and uncertainty
issues in  spatial data mining. New areas are always welcome.
*
Submission*

Potential participants are invited to submit extended abstracts
(around 1000 words) written in English and addressing some of
the above mentioned topics. Abstracts will be reviewed and
some will be selected for a paper presentation during the workshop.

Abstracts may present either a finished work, a work in progress,
or a reasoning about complex data mining in a geospatial context.
Discussions about work made across disciplines are also welcome.
Contributions are welcomed both from senior researchers and PhD students.
Abstracts  must be written in English according to the AGILE  submission
template  <http://agile2012.imag.fr/templates/AgileSubmissionTemplates.zip>  and formatting guidelines.
