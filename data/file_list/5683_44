orally or by poster) and *short papers* (up to 4 pages, presented as 
posters or demonstrations). All paper submissions will undergo a 
rigorous review process that will consider the originality, quality of 
work, and presentation of ideas, and relevance to document analysis 
system research. *Springer* will publish accepted full papers as part of
