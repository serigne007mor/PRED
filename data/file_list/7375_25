3. Scope

Data management in distributed systems and applications that require 
voluminous, distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic data sources is the 
subject of many research. These research leaded, principaly, in Cloud, 
Grid and Peer-to-Peer computing topics will make considerable impact on
large scale distributed data management. Today, these topics require 
more research in order to raise still open challenges like scalability, 
elasticity, consistency, security and autonomic data management.

The main objective of the annual international conference on data 
management in Cloud, Grid and P2P Systems is to present the latest 
results in research and applications, to identify new issues, and to 
shape future directions.
