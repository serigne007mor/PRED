CALL FOR PAPERS

In the real-time Web, the latest evolution of the Web, information is=20=20
generated very quickly, consumed by millions of users, and updated=20=20
rapidly by others through commenting, replying, transferring, etc.=20=20
This is practiced by people who differ in culture, knowledge,=20=20
background, ideology. Moreover, information generally comes from=20=20
several channels and is sent out to different ones. This is amplified=20=20
by the social networking phenomenon -- the social Web, which is=20=20
nowadays a well established set of technologies, based on which users=20=20
and service providers can exchange messages through an interaction=20=20
network, share information and collaborate, advertise a product,=20=20
create communities and influence them, etc. Besides, there is an=20=20
abundant literature regarding the different aspects of social networks=20=20
be it their construction or the detection of nodes playing specific=20=20
roles.

However, there is currently no clear understanding of the laws=20=20
governing these social networks, in particular how they evolve over=20=20
time. Thus, it is difficult to draw a clear image linking the existing=20=20
models of social networks and the real underlying social mechanisms.=20=20
As a result, there is a big gap in concertizing and evaluating most of=20=20
the research efforts in this area. Furthermore, due to the growing=20=20
complexity of digital social networks and the huge quantity of new=20=20
data available everyday, it becomes crucial for the researchers to=20=20
provide a clear understanding of the dynamics of these networks. It=20=20
also becomes important for the community to not only understand what=20=20
is happening currently in the network but also to predict the next=20=20
evolution and monitor the trends in the network. In order to be=20=20
efficient in analyzing these networks, it is important to be able to=20=20
predict the dynamics in its different forms: the content evolution=20=20
(i.e., hot topics evolution), network structure (e.g., creation of new=20=20
relations), information diffusion, influence evolution, etc.

To address the above mentioned aspects of social network dynamics, we=20=20
solicit the following topics (but not limited to):
- Information diffusion in social networks;
- Community extraction, analysis, and evolution;
- Detection of (possibly evolving) roles;
- Content evolution and tracking in social networks;
- Social media recommendations;
- Information quality and evolution in social content;
- Security and privacy in rapidly evolving social networks;
- Evaluation techniques and benchmarks;
- New challenges in mining social networks;
- Example studies and use cases of dynamics of social networks;

Paper submission
Submissions need to be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings=20=20
Template. Two types of submissions are welcome: long with a limit of 8=20=20
pages or short with 4 pages length limit. We use the EasyChair system=20=20
for managing submissions, and the link to submit your paper is here: http:/=
/eric.univ-lyon2.fr/msnd/=20
.  Finally, the best papers will be invited to extend their proposal=20=20
for a special issue of a journal. Further information will be=20=20
communicated soon regarding this special issue.
