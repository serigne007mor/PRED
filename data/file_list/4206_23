Dear colleagues,

please share among phd students and postdoc this call for a =
Post-Doctoral Position on "Resilience of Cities to Climate Change: =
Extreme Events documentation and Best practices=E2=80=9D:

The postdoctoral project is focused on conducting a study that lists the =
main extreme events due to
climate change (floods, heatwaves, storms, fires, cold waves, etc.) that =
have had significant impacts
on the metabolism of cities. The extent of their consequences along with =
best practices implemented
during such events, occurred in the past five years, shall be surveyed =
and analysed.

Missions:
o Identify the main extreme events that have impacted the operational =
metabolism of a city,
including networks and infrastructure (buildings, mobility, supply, =
energy, water, etc.) from
scientific literature and specialized publications. The events to be =
considered include storms,
floods, forest fires, heatwaves, etc.
o Analyze the actual consequences of these events on infrastructure, =
public services, and city
organization, as well as on population, especially the most vulnerable =
one: impacts, immediate
consequences, lessons learned, type of adaptation strategy =
organizational changes if any.
o Document the consequences and actions and strategies implemented in =
the medium term to
improve the city's adaptation to future events.
o Data collection through a questionnaire complemented by interviews to =
collect other cases and
best practices.
o Identify the challenges, best practices, research gaps and =
recommendations to enhance the
resilience of the city to extreme events.

Required:
A PhD in engineering science, social sciences, geography, planning, =
urbanism, or any other field
related to the study of territorial resilience and networks in the =
context of climate change is required.

The essential assets to succeed in this position are:
o Good knowledge of survey methods and statistical tools.
o Rigor, autonomy, and very good organization for priority management.
o Very good ability to work in a team and to communicate effectively.
o English Proficiency and Writing and interpersonal skills and team =
spirit.

Job Offer details:
o This position is a 12-month fixed-term contract, based on our campus =
in Lyon (69), attached to the LICIT-ECO7 lab.
o Travel to Paris is expected.
o Start as soon as possible.

How to apply: interested candidates are invited to send their CV and =
cover letter to:
o M. Dominique Fernier, Director of the Gustave Eiffel University =
Foundation
E-mail: dominique.fernier@univ-eiffel.fr and
o Prof. Nour-Eddin El Faouzi, Research Director, COSYS/LICIT-ECO7
E-mail: nour-eddin.elfaouzi@univ-eiffel.fr

Best,

Angelo Furno
