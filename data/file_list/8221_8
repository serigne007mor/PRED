Subject: [liste-egc] Call for papers GKR 2013

 ==============================GKR@IJCAI 2013 CALL FOR 
 PAPERS=========================================

 THE THIRD IJCAI INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON GRAPH STRUCTURES FOR 
 KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING

 =====================================================================================================

 Graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning is a growing area of 
 research, with more and more important

 contributions appearing over the last few years.

 The workshop welcomes contributions that:

 -- address graph-based representation, query and reasoning paradigms  
 (e.g. Baysian Networks (BNs), Semantic

 Networks (SNs), RDF/S, SPARQL \& RIF, Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal 
 Concept Analysis (FCA), Euler Diagrams,

 CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, abstract argumentation frameworks etc.) from a 
 theoretical and application viewpoint or

 -- apply graph-theoretic results to existing KR formalisms for 
 reasoning optimization purposes.

 Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to 
 demonstrate the benefits of the proposed

 solutions. Examples of such domains include Semantic Web, Grid 
 Computing, BioInformatics, Multi Agent Systems,

 Recommender Systems etc.

 The GKR 2013 opens a special graph database demonstration and 
 application track. Papers submitted to this track

 should report on theory, implementation results and applications of 
 graph databases. Short demo papers are also

 welcome.

 For more details please check: www.lirmm.fr/~croitoru/GKR

 =====================================================================================================

 Paper deadline: April 20th, 2013
 Notification: May 20th, 2013
 Workshop date: August 3rd - 5th, 2013 (one day workshop)

 Post Proceedings of the workshop will be published in a special issue 
 of the Springer LNAI Series.

 =====================================================================================================

 Workshop organizing committee:

 --Madalina Croitoru (LIRMM, France)

 --Christophe Gonzales (LIP6, France)

 --Sebastian Rudolph (KIT, Germany)

 --Stefan Woltran (Tech. Univ. Vienna, Austria)
