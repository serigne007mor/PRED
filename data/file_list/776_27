Second Call for contributions to One-day Workshop,

  "Statistical approaches and validation in clustering:
   Mixture models and nonparametric methods."


** Location and date: Lisieux, France, June Friday 29, 2007
Conference web-site http://www.iutcaen.unicaen.fr/stid/colloque/main.html


** Topics and aims

Cluster analysis is an important part of Data Mining and MachineLearning.
Several problems are difficult to be solved as the determination of the num=
ber
of clusters, the selection of the relevant variables, and the stability and
relevance of the clusters. The purpose of this one-day workshop is to addre=
ss
these topics, from a theoretical point of view. Mixture Models of parametric
probability distributions provide a statistically mature approach to answer
such questions. But, there is a recent interest for making use of nonparame=
tric
stability-based methods to evaluate the clusters, and to help in the choice=
 of
the parameters of a clustering algorithm. The workshop is aiming to present
those two different approaches and discuss their connections.

Title: On using criteria of cohesion and isolation to evaluate clustering
stability

Abstract: The practice of computing cluster stability scores for assessing
cluster quality and determining an optimal number of clusters has many
adherents. However, different papers have pointed out that this type of
approach may fail when the data sample size becomes large. Here, we here re=
fer
particularly to the asymptotic results recently obtained by Ben-David, von
Luxburg and Pal. In this talk, we will focus on the case of real data sizes,
and will consider cluster stability scores that are derived from the criter=
ia
of cohesion and isolation of clusters. We will then show that this approach=
 may
help in providing an efficient way to distinguish between two different typ=
es of
cluster instability, as implicitly considered by Ben-David, von Luxburg and=
 Pal.
Our conclusions will be based over a variety of simulated and real data set=
s.

Title: Clustering mixture models: general aspects and model selection crite=
ria

Abstract: Finite mixture models are commonly used as a basis for cluster
analysis. One advantage of model-based clustering is that it provides a
specific framework for assessing the resulting partitions of the data and
especially for selecting a relevant model. In this presentation, the mixture
model framework for clustering will be reviewed and different selection
criteria like BIC and ICL criteria will be discussed.


*G=E9rard Govaert and Gilles Celeux

Title: Some specific aspects of clustering mixture models

Abstract:
 - Block clustering: although many clustering procedures aim to construct
an optimal partition of objects or, sometimes, of variables, there are other
methods, called block clustering methods, which consider simultaneously the
two sets and organize the data into homogeneous blocks. Block mixture model,
which allows to embed simultaneous clustering of objects and variables in a
mixture approach, will be reviewed and extension of BIC and ICL criteria
will be discussed.
- Variable selection: In many situations, a lot of variables can be useless
or even harmful to detect a reasonable clustering structure. Thus it is
important to select the relevant variables from cluster analysis view point
and the second part of this presentation will be devoted to a variable sele=
ction
procedure including into the clustering process.


*Ulrike von Luxburg

Title: Statistical aspects of clustering stability

Abstract: Clustering stability is a widely used tool to select parameters of
clustering algorithms, most prominently the number k of clusters. The basic
intuition is that the "best" choice of parameters is the one for which the
clustering results are "most stable" or "most reliable". While there is much
experimental evidence that this paradigm can be successful in real world
applications, from a theoretical point of view it is still unclear what this
method really does.  In particular it is important to understand in which
situations clustering stability makes a reasonable choice of parameters, an=
d in
which situations it will fail.  In my talk I will discuss statistical aspec=
ts of
clustering stability, and point out how theoretical results on those questi=
ons
can be achieved.


*Brendan Murphy

Title: Parsimonious Gaussian Mixture Models

Abstract: Parsimonious Gaussian mixture models are developed using a latent
Gaussian model which is closely related to the factor analysis model. These
models provide a unified modelling framework which includes the mixture of
probabilistic principal component analyzers and mixture of factor of analyz=
ers
models as special cases.

In particular, a class of twelve parsimonious Gaussian mixture models which=
 are
based on the mixtures of factor analyzers model are introduced and the maxi=
mum
likelihood estimates for the parameters in these models are found using an =
AECM
algorithm. The class of models includes parsimonious models that have not
previously been developed.

These models are applied to the analysis of chemical and physical propertie=
s of
Italian wines and the chemical properties of coffee; the models are shown to
give excellent clustering performance.


Giorgio Valentini

Title: Stability based methods for the assessment of clustering solutions

Abstract: The assessment of  the reliability of clusters discovered  in the=
 data
is  a central problem  in unsupervised  learning. We  can distinguish  betw=
een
 two related  problems:  model  order selection and the assessment of the
reliability of each individual cluster.
Recently, several methods based on the concept of stability have been propo=
sed
to estimate  the  "optimal" number of clusters in complex high-dimensional
data. Despite their successful applications in bioinformatics,these
Stability-based  methods provide  only a  score  or a  measure of  the
reliability of the discovered  clusters, without any assessment of the
statistical significance of the  clustering solutions;  moreover they are n=
ot
able to directly detect multiple structures (e.g. hierarchical
structures)simultaneously present  in  the  data. To this end a
chi-squared-based statistical test and a distribution-free test based  on t=
he
classical Bernstein inequality have been recently proposed, showing that
stability-based methods can be successfully  applied to the  the assessment=
 of
the  reliability of clusterings, as well as to discover multiple structures
underlying complex high dimensional data.
