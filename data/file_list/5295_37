6th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Systems (ICIKS 2023)


We invite you to submit a paper to ICIKS 2023 conference in  
Portsmouth, UK, June 22-23, 2023

Conference URL : http://www.iciks.org/

The 6th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Systems  
(ICIKS 2023) will be held at University of Portsmouth between the 22th  
and 23th June. The ICIKS 2023 will bring together academics,  
researchers, practitioners and other professionals from around the  
world and provide opportunities to highlight recent advances in the  
fields of Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge  
Management, Decision Support and Digital decision tools.  We welcome  
submissions on theoretical developments and applications of all these  
fields. The ICIKS 2023 will also provide opportunities to share ideas,  
expertise and networking.

The ICIKS 2023 seeks to promote discussions on various organizational,  
technological, and socio-cultural aspects of research in the design  
and use of information and knowledge systems in organizations.  
Considering the large amount of data, information, and knowledge  
created and used in the organizations, especially with the evolution  
of information and communications technology platforms, organizations  
under the process of digital transformation constantly search for  
innovative concepts and creative applications. More importantly, ICIKS  
aims beyond the predominant role of technologies, seeking discussions  
on the essential interactions between individuals, who are the  
ultimate technology users.

The ICIKS 2023 will introduce a Best Paper Award to recognize and  
promote quality contributions to academic research. All papers  
submitted and published in the ICIKS 2023 conference publications are  
eligible for competition for the Best Paper Award. A special Award  
Selection Committee will select, score and rank the best submitted  
papers based on their originality, quality, positioning and writing  
style. A signed award certificate with the name of the award, the name  
of the paper, and the names of the authors of the paper. The authors  
of awarded paper will be offered a free registration for the 7th  
version ICIKS. The award will be announced during the closing session  
and released on the conference website.

Topics of interest will include, but are not limited to:
