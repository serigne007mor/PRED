Subject: [liste-egc] Inria junior researcher positions - deadline: March 5th

Dear colleagues,

This year, Inria (French National Institute for Research in Computer
Science and Control) is recruting 48 junior researchers: 24 research
fellows (CRCN) and 24 Inria starting faculty positions (ISFP). Both
types of recruitements are equivalent to standard tenured
positions in other countries such as the US and the UK, with an
important advantage—Inria positions are full-time research positions.
There is no required teaching for CRCN (unless one wishes to teach),
reduced teaching duties for ISFP (32-64 hours/year).

The Inria Center in Grenoble will be recruiting at least 5 permanent
researchers. Some themes may be reinforced, such as operating systems,
data and knowledge management, learning and its applications, and
environment and responsible computing.
This concerns in particular teams in data and knowledge management
such as MOEX and TYREX. However, the recruitment campaign is widely
open to all research themes and centers (please visit
https://www.inria.fr/en/list-of-project-teams).

An Inria researcher is part of a team. Team members are typically
united by a common research project, or common research interests.
Thus, all applicants should contact the head of the team in their
research domain for advice and guidance. It is important to contact
the team leader at the earliest.

The deadline for submitting the application is March 5th. Further
details about the application procedure are available here:
https://www.inria.fr/en/recruitment-campaign-researchers-2023

all the best
–Jérôme Euzenat (MOEX) and Pierre Genevès (TYREX).
