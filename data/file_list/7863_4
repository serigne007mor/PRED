Dear Colleagues,=20

Description:=20
=A0One of the strongest problems afflicting current machine learning=20
techniques is dataset dimensionality. During the recent years,=20
companies, collaborations, and organizations are increasingly faced with=20
the need to analyze of large and growing collections of data. Big data=20
requires technologies to efficiently process large quantities of data=20
within tolerable elapsed times. The used technologies include massively=20
parallel processing datasets, multi-sourcing, cloud computing platforms,=20
distributed databases...=20

Beyond the purely quantitative, these data are presented in such a way=20
that they are hardly supported by traditional machine learning methods:=20
data is not organized in the form of tables and their structures can=20
vary; is produced in real time; arrive worldwide in continuous streams;=20
is heterogeneous and located on different sources (mobile phones,=20
sensors, connected TVs, tablets, desktop PCs, laptops, objects, machines).=
=20

In particular, the high dimensionality of data is a highly critical=20
factor for the clustering task. Another important challenge in=20
clustering is the dimensionality reduction which deals with the=20
transformation of a high dimensional data set into a low dimensional=20
space, while retaining most of the useful structure in the original=20
data; retaining only relevant features and observations. Different=20
clusters might be found in different subspaces, so a global filtering of=20
attributes is not sufficient. Although the majority of clustering=20
procedures aim to construct an optimal partition of observations or,=20
there are other methods, known as co-clustering in document clustering,=20
biclustering in bioinformatics context or latent block models, which=20
consider the two sets simultaneously and organize the data into=20
homogeneous blocks. Compared to conventional clustering methods, they=20
have proved their effectiveness in discovering structures from matrices=20
of large high dimensional datasets.=20

=A0All these challenges can be treated together in order to establish a=20
scalable, affordable, and flexible large-scale analytics infrastructure.=20
