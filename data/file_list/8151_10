Second Call for Papers. ICFCA 2015

13th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis

June 23 - 26, 2015, Nerja, Spain

http://www.matap.uma.es/icfca2015/index.html

=======================================================
================================================================================

What is it?

Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980's from attempts to 
restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication 
between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since 
its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research 
field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a 
rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge 
processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge 
management and discovery.

The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioner 
working on theoretical or applied aspects of Formal Concept Analysis 
within major related areas such as Mathematics and Computer and 
Information Sciences and their diverse applications to fields like 
Software Engineering, Linguistics, Life and Social Sciences, etc.

Main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Fundamental aspects of FCA
- FCA theory
- Lattice theory
- Lattice drawing
- Philosophical foundations
- Algorithms and complexity theory

Bridging FCA to information sciences and artificial intelligence
- FCA and logic (semantic web, description logics, ...)
- FCA and conceptual structures (concept graphs, knowledge space, ...)
- FCA and data analysis (hierarchical classification, data organization, 
...)
- FCA and data mining (pattern mining)
- FCA and machine learning (learning with hypothesis, feature selection, 
...)
- FCA and database theory (dependencies, rules, data cubes, ...)
- FCA and software engineering
- FCA and morphological mathematics

Understanding, modelling real-world data and phenomena with FCA
- Analysis of "big data" with FCA (sampling, parallel computing, ...)
- Analysis of social networks and their dynamics
- Applications for scientific data analysis (in biology, health, ...)
- Applications for sensors data and user interactions traces
- Other FCA applications

Submission Details

We invite scientific publications on theory and applications of Formal 
Concept Analysis. Papers of up to sixteen pages may be submitted in the 
PDF or Postscript format via the Easychair system 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfca2015. For each paper, an 
abstract must be submitted by January 16, 2015. Authors are requested to 
follow the formatting instructions for the Springer LNCS style, see 
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Accepted papers must be presented at the conference, therefore at least 
one author per paper has to register timely. All submissions will be 
refereed, and the conference proceedings will be published by
Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.

Important Dates

Submission of abstract: January 16 2015
