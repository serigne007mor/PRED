1. Call for Research papers
*******************************************
In this track of ISWC 2019, we are looking for novel and significant
research contributions addressing theoretical, analytical and empirical
aspects of the Semantic Web. While we welcome work that relates to the W3C
Semantic Web recommendations (e.g., RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc.), we also
encourage contributions to research at the intersection of Semantic Web and
other scientific disciplines. Submissions to the research track should
describe original, significant, and replicable research on the Semantic
Web. All papers must include method evaluations that are rigorous,
repeatable and reproducible. This will be one of the key paper reviewing
criteria. We also strongly encourage papers that provide material such as
data sets, source code, queries used to evaluate their approach, and/or
live deployments. To comply with the double blind review policy we
encourage the usage of non-personal storage spaces or the  additional
material facility available at submission time.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
 * Database, information retrieval, information extraction, natural
language processing and artificial intelligence techniques for the Semantic
Web
 * Knowledge representation and reasoning on the Web
 * Knowledge graphs and deep semantics
 * Machine learning and data mining methods for the Semantic Web
 * Data mining and knowledge discovery in Linked data and ontologies
 * Robust and scalable management of semantics and data on the Web and in
Linked Data
 * Processing and storage of semantic data on the blockchain
 * Methods to investigate and catalogue semantic primitives used in
ontology definitions
 * Enabling access to ontologies and knowledge bases by rendering the
knowledge in different modalities, e.g. as natural language text,
explanatory video, interactive elements, etc.
 * Languages, tools, and methodologies for representing and managing
semantics and data on the Web
 * Programming the Semantic Web
 * Architectures and algorithms for extreme volume, heterogeneity,
dynamicity, and decentralization of Semantic Web data
 * Cleaning, quality assurance, and provenance of Semantic Web data,
services, and processes
 * Ontology-based data access and integration/exchange on the Web
 * Ontology engineering and ontology patterns for the Web
 * Ontology modularity, mapping, merging, and alignment for the Web
 * Search, query, integration, and analysis on the Semantic Web
 * Supporting multi-linguality in the Semantic Web
 * Question answering over Linked Data and ontologies
 * Information visualization and exploratory analysis methods for Semantic
Web data
 * Semantic social network mining, analysis, representation, and management
 * Crowdsourcing semantics; methods, dynamics, and challenges

2. Call for In-use papers
*******************************************

The adoption of Semantic Web technologies has accelerated in recent years,
where they are now deployed in a variety of real-world settings at a
variety of scales. The In-Use Track at ISWC 2019 continues the tradition of
demonstrating and learning from the increasing adoption of Semantic Web
technologies by providing a forum for the community to explore the benefits
and challenges of applying such technologies in concrete, practical use
cases, beyond the research communities from which they originate, in
contexts ranging from industry to government and science.

The In-Use Track thus seeks submissions describing applied and validated
solutions such as software tools, systems or architectures that benefit
from the use of Semantic Web technologies (including, but not limited to,
technologies based on the Semantic Web standards). Importantly, submitted
papers should provide convincing evidence of the use of the proposed
application or tool by the target user group, preferably outside the group
that conducted the development and, more broadly, outside the Semantic Web
research community. A main focus of the submissions should be on the
benefits of Semantic Web technologies for the intended use case, as well as
(if relevant) the added challenges they introduce.

We welcome submissions that demonstrate the use of Semantic Web
technologies such as those mentioned in the Call for Papers of the Research
Track, and additionally cover one or more of the following topics:
 * Applications in domain-specific areas (e.g., libraries, cultural
heritage, healthcare, life sciences, engineering, smart manufacturing,
smart cities, open government)
 * Description and analysis of concrete and novel problems or use cases in
a specific domain in which Semantic Web technologies were applied (this
should be part of submissions presenting a concrete application)
 * Descriptions of how Semantic Web resources (ontologies, datasets,
software, standards, etc) are being used in practice
 * Assessment of the Semantic Web technologies from diverse points of view,
such as:
         - Usability and acceptance by stakeholder groups
         - Uptake outside the Semantic Web research community
         - Scalability of Semantic Web solutions and their large scale
deployment
         - Technical strengths and weaknesses especially in comparison with
alternative technologies (e.g., database management systems, model-driven
engineering)
         - Costs and benefits of implementing, deploying, using, and
managing Semantic Web technologies
         - Risks and opportunities of using Semantic Web technologies in
organizations with respect to their businesses and customers
 * Lessons learned and best practices from deploying and using an
application or service based on Semantic Web technologies
 * Comparison of Semantic Web technologies with alternative approaches that
use conventional or competing technologies

3. Call for Resource papers
*******************************************
Resources are of paramount importance as they foster scientific
advancement. For example, the DBpedia resource had a major influence on the
Semantic Web community by enabling the Linked (Open) Data movement.
Validating a research hypothesis or providing answers to a research
question often goes together with developing new resources that support
these achievements. Sharing resources is key to allow other researchers to
compare new results, reproduce experimental settings and explore new lines
of research, in accordance with the FAIR principles for scientific data
management. Yet, resources themselves rarely get the same recognition as
the scientific advances they facilitate.

The ISWC 2019 Resources Track aims to promote the sharing of resources
including, but not restricted to: datasets, ontologies/vocabularies,
ontology design patterns, evaluation benchmarks or methods, software
tools/services, APIs and software frameworks, workflows, crowdsourcing task
designs, protocols, methodologies and metrics, that contribute to the
generation of novel scientific work. In particular, we encourage the
sharing of such resources following best practices within the Semantic Web
community. This track calls for contributions that provide a concise and
clear description of a resource and its usage.

A typical Resource track paper has its focus set on reporting on one of the
following categories of resources:
 * Datasets produced
         - to support specific evaluation tasks;
         - to support novel research methods;
         - by novel algorithms;
 * Ontologies, vocabularies and ontology design patterns, with a focus on
describing the modelling process and decisions underlying their creation;
 * Benchmarking activities focusing on datasets and algorithms for
comprehensible and systematic evaluation of existing and future systems;
 * Reusable research prototypes / services supporting a given research
hypothesis;
 * Community-shared software frameworks that can be extended or adapted to
support scientific study and experimentation;
 * Scientific and experimental workflows used and reused in practical
studies;
 * Novel evaluation methodologies and metrics, and their demonstration in
an experimental study.

4. Call for Doctoral Consortium Papers
**********************************************
The ISWC 2019 Doctoral Consortium will take place as part of the 18th
International Semantic Web Conference in Auckland, New Zealand. This forum
will provide PhD students an opportunity to share and develop their
research ideas in a critical but supportive environment, to get feedback
from mentors who are senior members of the Semantic Web research community,
to explore issues related to academic and research careers, and to build
relationships with other Semantic Web PhD students from around the world.

The Consortium aims to broaden the perspectives and to improve the research
and communication skills of these students.

The Doctoral Consortium is intended for students who have a specific
research proposal and some preliminary results, but who have sufficient
time prior to completing their dissertation to benefit from the consortium
experience. Generally, students in their second or third year of PhD will
benefit the most from the Doctoral Consortium. In the Consortium, the
students will present their proposals and get specific feedback and advice
on how to improve their research plan.

All proposals submitted to the Doctoral Consortium will undergo a thorough
reviewing process with a view to providing detailed and constructive
feedback. The international program committee will select - submissions for
presentation at the Doctoral Consortium.

Students with accepted submissions at the Doctoral Consortium will be
eligible to apply for  travel fellowships to offset some of the travel
costs but they will be asked to attend the whole day of the Doctoral
Consortium.

We ask the PhD students to submit a 12 page description of their PhD
research proposal. All proposal have to be submitted electronically via the
EasyChair conference submission System. The proposal text must have at
least 8 sections (some can be very short), addressing each of the following
questions:
1. Problem statement: What is the problem that you are addressing?
2. Relevancy: Why is the problem important? Who will benefit if you
succeed? Who should care?
3. Related work: How have others attempted to address this problem? Why is
the problem difficult?
4. Research question(s): What are the research questions that you plan to
address?
5. Hypotheses: What hypotheses are related to your research questions? See
Is This Really Science? The Semantic Webber=E2=80=99s Guide to Evaluating R=
esearch
Contributions.
6. Preliminary results: Do you have any preliminary results that
demonstrate that your approach is promising?
7. Approach: How are you planning to address your research questions and
test your hypotheses? What is the main idea behind your approach? The key
innovation?
8. Evaluation plan: How will you measure your success =E2=80=93 faster/ mor=
e
accurate/ less failures/ etc.? How do you plan to test your hypothesis?
What will you measure? What will you compare to?
9. Reflections: Why do you think you will succeed where others failed?
Provide an argument, based either on common knowledge or on evidence that
you have accumulated, that your approach is likely to succeed.

 be one of the key paper reviewing criteria. We also strongly encourage pap=
