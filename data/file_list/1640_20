Introduction:
-------------

Thanks to the success of the 2nd International Workshop on Ontology,
Conceptualization and Epistemology for Software and System Engineering
(ONTOSE 2007, see details at www.lintar.disco.unimib.it/ontose07) a
growing interest in the definition of new frameworks for the development
of high quality software systems emerges.

Software Engineering and the broader discipline of Systems Engineering
have matured in the last years as disciplines with specific techniques,
methods and principles. This has resulted in considerable research on
aspects that are related to the disciplines in themselves, as for
example, how empirical research should be conducted, what are the
conditions for "valid" knowledge, how design theory is constructed and
which is the scope of theories in the field. These are elements that are
of interest from the perspective of philosophy in general, and of
specific interest to ontology and epistemological inquiry. Concretely,
the material and temporal entities that are dealt with in the field are
a matter of ontology, and the conditions for credibility of statements
and research methods are a matter of epistemology.

The design and implementation of complex and high quality software
systems today require more and more the understanding of theoretical,
epistemological and conceptual frameworks coming from the human
sciences. The common interest on ontology is an actual and
scientifically grounded research area. The joined involvement of
researchers on Software and Systems Engineering investigating on
Ontology through conceptualization, epistemology, Computer Science,
Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence will open both novel
networking possibilities and the sharing of common scientific and
cultural interests.


Goal and Scope of the Special Issue:
------------------------------------

The goal of the special issue is to give an overview of the
state-of-the-art research on the design of high quality software
systems. Topics include, but are not restricted to:

•	Ontology and formal ontology representations of Software Engineering,
Systems Engineering and Information Systems.
•	Studies and essays about metrics, indicators and general issues
regarding research on Software and Systems Engineering.
•	Conceptualizations, bodies of knowledge or schemas for SE or SWE
representation.
•	Applications that deal with representations of concepts and relations
of the disciplines.
•	Social, psychological and organizational issues about the disciplines.
•	Epistemological and philosophical aspect of software development.
•	Architectural patterns for the design of high-quality software.
•	UML modeling.
•	Case Studies.


Submissions:
------------

We welcome the submission of original research papers that are not under
review for workshops, conferences or other journals. We seek
theoretical, experimental, methodological as well as application papers.
Interested authors should send a tentative title and a short abstract
(400-500 words) by October 10th.

Submissions will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, belonging to
the Program Commitee of Ontose 2007
(www.lintar.disco.unimib.it/ontose07/people.jsp). Selection criteria
include: relevance, technical correctness, originality of the
contribution and quality of exposition.

The submission should be 15-20 pages in length, including figures and
references. The paper must be formatted according to the KER style
(http://www.cambridge.org/journals/journal_ifc.asp?mnemonic=KER).
Submissions should be sent in PDF format to one of the following email
addresses:
- Daniela Micucci: micucci@disco.unimib.it
- Fabio Sartori: sartori@disco.unimib.it


Important Dates:
----------------

- Title and Abstract Submission: 19 October, 2007
- Full Paper Submission: 21 December, 2007
- Acceptance/Rejection Notification: 31 January, 2008
- Final Paper Submission: 2 March, 2008
- Publication: Autumn 2008
