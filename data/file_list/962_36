r>Two types of paper submissions will be accepted: a) scientific research<b=
r>papers, and b) industry experience reports or case studies.<br><br>Scient=
ific research papers should describe original results that have<br>not been=
 accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. These papers<br>will be e=
valuated for scientific or technical contribution, originality,<br>appropri=
ateness and significance. <br><br>Experience reports should describe new in=
sights gained from case studies<br>or the application of enterprise computi=
ng technology in practice,<br>contribute important feedback about the state=
 of practice and how<br>current research is applied, and pose challenges fo=
r researchers. These<br>papers will be evaluated based on their appropriate=
ness, significance<br>and clarity.<br><br>All papers should be limited to 1=
0 pages in length. <br>All submissions must comply with the IEEE Computer S=
ociety conference<br>proceedings format guidelines<br>(<span class=3D"Objec=

 a set of selected papers will be invited to prepare a<br>substantially rev=
ised and extended version of their papers for publication <br>in a special =
journal issue (details will be announced later). In previous <br>years, sel=
ected papers from EDOC have been published in Springer's <br>Information Sy=
stems Frontiers (ISF), Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), <br>and Intern=
ational Journal of Cooperative Information Systems (IJCIS). A <br>special i=
ssue with selected and extended papers of EDOC 2010 will appear <br>at the =
Enterprise Information Systems journal (published by Taylor &amp; <br>Franc=
is, with an impact factor of 2.809 in JCR 2009).<br><br>KEYNOTES<br><br>The=
 EDOC 2011 programme will feature a number of keynote lectures,<br>includin=

Workshops complement IEEE EDOC's main scientific program with<br>presentati=
ons and discussions of both mature and preliminary project<br>results, idea=
s, experiences, and knowledge in a way that is more<br>interactive and more=
 focused than paper sessions in the main conference<br>program. To foster t=
his interactivity and focus, workshops target a<br>narrower range of topics=
.<br><br>Workshop proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Societ=
y and<br>included in the IEEE Computer Society Digital Library (CSDL) and t=
he<br>IEEE Xplore.<br><br>You can find short summaries of the workshops bel=
ow. Please check the <br>detailed scope and submission instructions at each=
 workshop page.<br><br>* 2nd International Workshop on Models and Model-dri=

><br>Service Level Management (SLM) is the process of managing the Quality =
of <br>Service (QoS) demanded by clients and offered by providers. AQuSerM =
is <br>concerned with recent developments in QoS management: the monitoring=
 of widely<br>distributed services, particularly new paradigms of enterpris=
e system (SOA <br>and the Cloud), dynamic adaptation strategies and the nec=
essity for more <br>sophisticated prediction and diagnostic analysis techni=
