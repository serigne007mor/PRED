ICCS'08 - Conceptual Structures: Knowledge Visualization and Reasoning

7-11 July, Toulouse, France

http://www.iccs.info <http://www.iccs.info/>

The 16th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS 2008)
is the latest in a series of annual conferences on Conceptual Structures
that have been held in Europe, Australia, and North America since 1993.
The focus of the conference has been the representation and analysis of
conceptual knowledge for research and practical application. ICCS brings
together researchers in information and computer sciences as well as
social science to explore novel ways that conceptual structures can be
deployed.

Conceptual Structures are motivated by C.S. Peirce's Existential Graphs
and over the years ICCS has broadened scope to include innovations from
a wider range of theories and related practices, among them Formal
Concept Analysis, Existential Graphs, Description Logics, Ontologies,
Concept Mapping and more. Accordingly, ICCS represents a family of
approaches related to conceptual structures that build on the successes
with techniques derived from artificial intelligence, knowledge
representation and reasoning, applied mathematics and lattice theory,
computational linguistics, conceptual modeling and design, visual
reasoning and logic, intelligent systems and knowledge management.

In 2008 ICCS's theme is Knowledge Visualization and Reasoning with an
emphasis to connect the theory and practice of conceptual structures to
its original visual forms of diagrammatic reasoning.

Papers for ICCS 2008 are invited on the following topics:

* conceptual structures  - theory and applications;
* the interplay of conceptual structures with language, semantics,
semiotics and pragmatics;
* conceptual data processing, analysis and conceptual logic;
* modeling, representation and visualizing conceptual structures;
* conceptual knowledge acquisition;
* knowledge representation with conceptual structures
* Automated Reasoning and Conceptual Structures
* applied conceptual structures including data mining and knowledge
discovery
* the theory and applications of formal ontologies.

Authors are invited to submit papers describing both theoretical and
practical research outcomes. Papers accepted or under review by other
conferences or journals are not acceptable as submissions to ICCS. The
language of the conference will be English.

Submission Details

Papers are limited to 14 pages in Springer's LNCS format. We recommend
the use of LaTeX2e for the final version. For more details see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs <http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs> .
Position papers (up to 4 pages) are also welcome.

Deadlines

* Monday December 31, 2007: a one page abstract submitted via conference
website (http://www.iccs.info <http://www.iccs.info/> ) (Abstracts
should clearly state the purpose, results and conclusions of the work to
be described in the final paper.)

* Monday January 7, 2008: full paper (not more than 14 pages) in PDF
format submitted via conference website (http://www.iccs.info
<http://www.iccs.info/> )

Final acceptance will be based on the full-length paper, which if
accepted, must be presented at the conference. Papers accepted for
publication will appear in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence
Series by Springer-Verlag (see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs
<http://www.springeronline.com/lncs> ). A precondition for publication
is that the final version is in full compliance with Springer's format.
