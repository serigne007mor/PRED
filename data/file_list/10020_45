=========================================
CALL FOR PAPERS  (INDUSTRY & GOVERNMENT TRACK)
18th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2012)
August 12-16, 2012
Beijing, China

http://www.kdd.org/kdd2012/

Key Dates:
Papers due: February 10, 2012
Acceptance notification: May 4, 2012

Paper submission and reviewing will be handled electronically. Authors 
should consult the conference Web site for full details regarding paper 
preparation and submission guidelines.

Papers submitted to KDD 2012 should be original work and substantively 
different from papers that have been previously published or are under 
review in a journal or another conference/workshop.
As per KDD tradition, reviews are not double-blind, and author names and 
affiliations should be listed.

INDUSTRY & GOVERNMENT TRACK

The Industrial/Government Applications Track solicits papers describing 
implementations of KDD solutions relevant to industrial or government 
settings. The primary emphasis is on papers that advance the 
understanding of practical, applied, or pragmatic issues related to the 
use of KDD technologies in industry and government and highlight new 
research challenges arising from attempts to create such real KDD 
applications. Applications can be in any field including, but not 
limited to: e-commerce, medical and pharmaceutical, defense, public 
policy, finance, engineering, manufacturing, telecommunications, and 
government.
The Industrial/Government Applications Track will consist of 
competitively-selected contributed papers. Submitters must clearly 
identify in which of the following three sub-areas their paper should be 
evaluated as distinct review criteria will be used to evaluate each 
category of submission.

- Deployed KDD systems that are providing real value to industry, 
Government, or other organizations or professions. These deployed 
systems could support ongoing knowledge discovery or could be 
applications that employ discovered knowledge, or some combination of 
the two.
- Discoveries of knowledge with demonstrable value to Industry, 
Government, or other users (e.g., scientific or medical professions). 
This knowledge must be "externally validated" as interesting and useful; 
it can not simply be a model that has better performance on some 
traditional KDD metric such as accuracy or area under the curve.
- Emerging applications and technology that provide insight relevant to 
the above value propositions. These emerging applications must have 
clear user interest and support to distinguish them from KDD research 
papers, or they must provide insight into issues and factors that affect 
the successful use of KDD technology and methods. Papers that describe 
infrastructure that enables the large-scale deployment of KDD techniques 
also are in this area.
