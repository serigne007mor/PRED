            </b><b>Context:</b><br>
            In many applications, the data to be studied is of
            relational nature, modeled in the form of a network and
            represented by graphs. This representation makes possible
            the study of interactions between people, especially in
            social sciences. Although network analysis is an active
            branch of data mining and machine learning, a majority of
            works focuses on homogeneous networks de-scribed by a simple
            graph where the nodes correspond to the entities of the
            network and the links (edges or arcs) to their
            relationships.=C2=A0 However, in many applications, contextua=

            themselves are available and could be used to study in a
            more efficient way the network. <br>
            This led notably to the notions of signed graphs and
            attributed graphs. In a signed graph, each edge is labeled
            with either a negative or a positive sign, which allows
            representing antagonistic relationships [1].=C2=A0 In an
            attributed network, vertices are described by attributes
            which allow to take into account their individual
            characteristics, like for instance their genre or age [2].<br=

            These representations are much richer than a simple graph
            and permit to better model com-plex interaction systems.
            However, they require to adapt existing algorithms or to
            design new ones for solving efficiently all standard network
            visualization and analysis tasks, such as com-munity
            detection, link prediction or information diffusion.<br>
            This=C2=A0 PhD is part of the French Research project DeCoMaP
            (Detecting Corruption in Markets for Public Procurement)
            funded by the ANR (French NSF) which aims at retrieving,
            processing and analyzing open data related to French public
            procurements, in order to design a tool able to assess
            corruption risks between public buyers and suppliers.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Subject:</b><br>
            Designing automatic tools for the assessment of risks of
            corruption in public procurements is a task called red
            flagging. It is not completely new, as some teams have been
            working on it for a few years [1], especially at the
            European level [2]. However, none of them applies to French
            public procurements, as they do not handle its specifics
            (legal framework, nature and form of the available open
            data). Moreover, existing approaches focus on individual
            information, which characterize buyers and suppliers
            independently, and ignore relational information, which
            cor-responds to interactions and interdependencies between
            these agents.<br>
            In the context of the project DoCoMaP, we propose to design
            a new tool tackling these issues and limitations. More
            specifically, the goal of this thesis is to handle a large
            methodological part of this work, by representing the
            relationships between buyers and suppliers (normal
            con-tractual relationship or corruption) and by
            characterizing these agents through signed and/or attributed
            graphs. <br>
            As this type of graphs has been much less explored than
            simple graphs in the literature, the first task of this
            thesis consists in designing methods to extract them from
            the raw data, and to analyze them in the context of our
            application (corruption detection). In particular, it is
            neces-sary to define a corruption index that could be used
            to enrich the information already available in the graph at
            the level of its links (contracts between a public buyer and
            a supplier) and at the level of its vertices
            (characteristics of the actors).<br>
            The second task focuses on signed graph partitioning in the
            framework of structural balance [3]. A signed graph is said
            to be balanced if it can be partitioned into two [4] or more
            [5] mutu-ally hostile subgroups, each having internal
            solidarity (i.e. positive edges are inside clusters, and
            negative ones are between them). Some recent works started
            tackling this problem notably in our team [6], but there is
            still much to do for formalizing the problem and solving it
            efficiently, particularly using deep learning approaches
            [7]. In DeCoMap, signed graph partitioning will aim to bring
            out groups of agents (public buyers and supplier companies)
            likely to be related in fraudulent practices.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Working environment:</b><br>
            The PhD candidate will work at the Laboratoire Informatique
            d=E2=80=99Avignon (LIA =E2=80=93 EA 4128) under the supervisi=
on of Vincent
            Labatut and Rosa Figueiredo (LIA =E2=80=93 Avignon Universit=C3=
=A9,
            Avignon, France) and Christine Largeron, Professor in
            Computer Science (LabHC =E2=80=93 Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet=
,
            Saint-Etienne, France).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Funding:</b><br>
            The PhD fellowship is funded for 3 years through the ongoing
            DeCoMaP ANR project (ANR-19-CE38-0004) and is monthly funded
            about approximatively 1500 =E2=82=AC.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Profile of the candidate:</b><br>
            The candidate should have a master degree or equivalent in
            Computer Science. The subject is at the intersection of
            several domains: graph theory, statistics, data mining and
            machine learning, big data including databases (the
            considered networks can be huge). Thus the candidate should
            have strong backgrounds in several of these topics.<br>
            Other required skills:<br>
            =E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good abilities in algorithm desig=
n and programming.<br>
            =E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good technical skills regarding d=

            (databases, retrieval from web APIs)<br>
            =E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 A very good level (written and or=
al) in English.<br>
            =E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good communication skills (oral a=

            =E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The ability to work in a team wit=

            other scientific disciplines.<br>
