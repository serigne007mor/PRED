The 4th ODBIS VLDB Workshop on Ontology-based Techniques for DataBases 
in Information Systems and Knowledge Systems co-located with VLDB 2008 
in Auckland, New Zealand.

Date : August 23, 2008

Aims and Scope
--------------
Ontologies serve as a means for establishing a conceptually concise 
basis for communicating
knowledge in any context. Ontologies can be very useful for a community 
as a way of structuring and
defining the meaning of the metadata that are currently collected and 
standardized. Applications using
ontologies become more intelligent since they can more deal with human 
background
knowledge. More generally, ontologies are critical for applications 
which want to merge information
from diverse sources. They become a major conceptual backbone for a 
broad spectrum of activities
dealing with databases either in information systems (IS) or in 
knowledge systems (KS).
IS professionals and researchers have traditionally dealt with issues of 
identifying, capturing, and
representing domain knowledge within information systems. In the 
structural dimension, ontologies
can provide mechanisms for organizing and storing items including 
database schemes, user interface
objects, and application programs. In the temporal dimension, ontologies 
can guide the development
of new information systems by helping analysts and designers to choose 
appropriate processes,
algorithms, rules, and software components depending upon their needs. 
The "ontology-driven
information systems" approach proposes new ways of thinking about 
ontologies and IS in conjunction
with each other and covers both the structural and the temporal 
dimensions of information systems.

A key point in databases is the ability to make data available 
semantically, that is, to find an automated
and meaningful way of expressing their structure and semantics. Indeed 
schemes as sets of rules
represent complex agreements made by designers with domain experts about 
data and so constitute a
potentially valuable basic resource for eliciting ontologies. For 
instance, relational schemes are purely
lexical, often obtained from more conceptual ones which are flattened 
into tables with a loss of
information about roles and concepts. Within this perspective, an 
approach is to search for a tool
which will automatically create ontologies corresponding to the content 
of the database and make
them available for humans and machines.
On the other hand, due to their independence from lower level models, 
ontologies are used for
integrating heterogeneous databases enabling interoperability and 
specifying interfaces to knowledge
systems. Availability of the background knowledge stored in ontologies 
increases significantly the
support which can be given for indexing as well as for searching. 
Ontologies may be useful too for
conducting extraction tasks for discovering patterns, interpreting rules 
or conceptual clustering.

Furthermore ontologies can be used to provide semantic annotations for 
collections of images, audio
or other non-textual objects.

The objective of this workshop is to present researches on databases in 
information systems and
knowledge systems as they relate to ontologies and more broadly, to gain 
insight into ontologies as
they relate to databases. It is meant to cover foundations, 
methodologies and applications of ontology-
driven design, integration and management of databases in information 
systems and knowledge
systems.

Submission of papers
--------------------
Symposium submissions must generally be in electronic form using 
Portable Document Format (.pdf), PostScript (.ps) or WinWord (.doc). 
Submissions must not exceed 8 pages for full length papers or 4 pages 
for research-in-progress proposals and they must be formatted using the 
VLDB format.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of 
them will register to the workshop and present the paper.

Papers must be submitted electronically using the Easychair submission 
system at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=odbis2008


Important dates
---------------
Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 30, 2008
Camera ready due: July 20, 2008
Workshop: August 23, 2008
VLDB conference: August 24-30, 2008


Workshop Format
---------------
Each paper will be a 20-minutes presentation, followed by 10-minutes 
discussion and debate. The workshop will start with a talk by an invited 
speaker and will close with a panel to discuss key questions and topics 
that arise from the presentations. The panel will be multidisciplinary 
including researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry 
who have presented the best and/or most controversial papers.

Questions should be directed to the ODBIS organizers
