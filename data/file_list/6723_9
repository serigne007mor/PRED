http://www.iiwas.org/conferences/iiwas2011/
email: iiwas2011@iiwas.org


*Important Dates*

   - 15 July 2011:              Full Papers (8 pages), Short papers, Demos
   and work in progress (5 pages)
   - 15 September 2011:    Acceptance Notification
   - 15 October 2011:        Camera-Ready Papers and Authors Registration
   - 05-07 December 2011: Conference Dates

*Publication*

ALL accepted iiWAS2011 papers will be published by ACM International
Conference Proceedings Series in the ACM Digital Library (Approved) and the
supplemental proceedings and indexed appropriately in all major indexes. It
has been agreed that selected high-quality papers will be invited to be
published, after revision and extension, in in special issues of
international journals. In addition, if a sufficient number of high-quality
submissions are received, it is intended that a dedicated book will be
edited for the Book Series: Atlantis Ambient and Pervasive Intelligence
published by Springer.
*Scope*

WWW has been driving global information integration. In spite of the many
applications in all domains of our societies: e-business, e-commerce,
e-learning, e-science, and e-government, for instance, as well as the
tremendous advances by engineers and scientists, the seamless integration of
information and services remains a major challenge. The current shared
vision for the future is one of semantically rich information and service
oriented architectures for global information systems. This vision is at the
convergence of progress in technologies such as XML, Web services, RDF, OWL,
of multimedia, multimodal, and multilingual information retrieval, and of
distributed, mobile and ubiquitous computing. iiWAS2011 is the 13th in the
series of the highly successful International Conference on Information
Integration and Web-based Applications & Systems. Recently, iiWAS has been
held in Paris (2010), Kuala Lumpur (2009), and Linz (2008). This year
Vietnam will host iiWAS2011. The iiWAS conference series have provided
opportunities to researchers, graduate students, and industry practitioners
to address recent research results and current industry practices in the
area of information integration and web-based applications.

We invite two types of submissions: Full Technical Papers and Short Position
Papers. A Full Paper should provide solid conceptual and theoretical
foundation and substantial support for its results and conclusions as a
significant contribution to the field. A Position Paper could be "demo" or
=91work in progress, i.e., it reports the latest emerged ideas, approaches,
methodologies, systems and application scenarios but have not yet been fully
implemented and/or undergone extensive evaluation.

have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Submitted papers will subject to stringent peer
review by at least three members of the international program committee and
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness,
and clarity of exposition. Accepted papers will appear in the conference
proceedings to be published by ACM. Format requirements for submissions of
papers are:
