Subject: [liste-egc] IMMoA 2013 - 3rd International Workshop on Information
 Management in Mobile Applications  in conjunction with VLDB 2013

                              IMMoA 2013
                     3rd International Workshop on
               Information Management in Mobile Applications
                 http://www.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/IMMoA2013

          in conjunction with VLDB 2013 ( http://www.vldb.org/2013/ )
                     Riva del Garda, Trento, Italy
                        Monday, August 26, 2013

                         -- Call for Papers --

The increasing functionality and capacity of mobile devices have enabled
new mobile applications which require new approaches for data management.
Users want to have a seamless integration of their data on their mobile
with other devices, which can be either classical devices such as a desktop
PC or other mobile devices. Although the capabilities of mobile devices are
growing, their limitations have to be taken into account when designing
efficient and effective mobile applications. For example, constraints on
energy, CPU power, storage, display size, communication bandwidth, and
real-time capabilities have to be considered.

Information management in mobile applications is a complex problem space
which requires the consideration of the aforementioned constraints.
In addition, mobile data can have various forms, such as sensor data, user
profiles & user context, spatial data, and multimedia data. Smartphones,
mobile and wearable sensors, and other portable systems are used in various
applications to collect, process, and exchange an increasing amount of 
data.
Applications can run on several devices (mobile,  PCs, multimedia), but the
exchange, the integration, and the querying of data between these devices
remains a challenging problem.

The International Workshop on Information Management for Mobile Applications
(IMMoA'13) is a continuation of the successful IMMoA and HIMoA workshops in
the previous years. It aims at a broad range of mobile application fields:
Business, (Serious) Games, Leisure, and Transport. The previous editions of
the workshop were held at VLDB 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey and at MDM 2011 in
Lulea, Sweden (HIMoA 2011). The International Workshop on Information
Management for Mobile Applications (IMMoA'13) targets to provide a forum 
for
discussion about technologies and mechanisms, which support the management
of mobile, complex, integrated, distributed, and heterogeneous data-focused
applications.

The list of topics includes, but is not limited to:
  * Data management and integration in mobile peer-to-peer networks
  * Data stream management in mobile applications/environments
  * Data stream mining for mobile applications
  * Mobile Cloud Computing
  * Mobile Agents and cyber foraging
  * Big Data in mobile applications
  * Energy-efficient data management in mobile applications
  * Data integration in mobile settings
  * Semantic data management in mobile applications
  * Context-aware mobile computing
  * Applications using mobile data management techniques
  * Query processing and optimization for mobile systems
  * Real-time data processing in mobile applications
  * Security and privacy for mobile data management
  * Pervasive data management
  * Transaction processing in mobile applications
  * Expert systems for mobile information systems
  * Sensing and acquisition of data in mobile environments
  * Data sharing and interoperability in mobile applications
  * Managing data intensive mobile applications
  * Management and processing of geospatial data
  * Mobile health data management and analysis
  * Pervasive health systems and services
  * Location-based services
  * Mobile data management systems and middleware
  * Knowledge representation and reasoning in mobile applications


***** Important Dates *****

Deadline for Workshop Papers: May 31, 2013
Notification of Workshop Papers: July 1, 2013
Deadline for Camera Ready Papers: July 15, 2013
Workshop Date: Monday, August 26, 2013 (pre-conference)



***** Submission Guidelines *****

The page limits for accepted regular workshop papers are 8 pages, including
all figures, tables, and references, and 4 pages max for short papers. 
Papers
must be in VLDB format. Templates can be found at
http://www.vldb.org/2013/formatting_guidelines.html

Submissions in PDF are to be uploaded to the workshop's submission site
http://www.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/IMMoA2013/submission.shtml

All submissions must be unique and not have been published already in 
another context.



***** Workshop Proceedings *****

The proceedings of the workshop will be published online as a volume of 
the CEUR
Workshop Proceedings, ISSN 1613-0073, http://www.ceur-ws.org, a well-known
website for publishing workshop proceedings. It is indexed by the major
publication portals, such as Citeseer, DBLP, and Google Scholar.

Furthermore, we plan a special issue in a journal on mobile information 
systems
for which the authors of the best papers of the workshop will be invited to
submit an extended version of their work. The best papers of the 
previous edition
have been invited to a special issue in the journal on Pervasive and 
Mobile Computing
http://www.journals.elsevier.com/pervasive-and-mobile-computing/call-for-papers/



***** Workshop Organizers *****

Thierry Delot, University of Valenciennes & Inria Lille, France
Sandra Geisler, Information Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany
Sergio Ilarri, University of Zaragoza, Spain
Christoph Quix, Fraunhofer FIT, Germany
