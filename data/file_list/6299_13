12th International Conference on Grammatical Inference

                         ICGI 2014

       September 17-19, 2014, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

http://www.iip.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/icgi2014/

                    CALL FOR WORK IN PROGRESS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE, LOCATION AND PROCEEDINGS
===============================

ICGI 2014 is the 12th edition of the International Conference on
Grammatical Inference, held every two years.

The conference will be held in Kyoto University; in Kyoto, Japan, from September 17-19, 2014.
Kyoto is one of the most beautiful and historic cities in the world.

Regular papers that will be presented in the conference have been determined,
which will be published in the JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings series.
  (http://jmlr.org/proceedings/)

We are now calling for work in progress, which will be presented in a designated session of ICGI.
Abstracts of work in progress will not appear in the proceedings, but will appear in a conference booklet.


IMPORTANT DATES
===============

21 July 2014: Abstract submission deadline
28 July 2014: Notification of acceptance
17-19 September 2014: Conference


AREAS OF INTEREST
=================

The conference is on grammatical inference: the field of machine learning
applied to discrete combinatorial structures such as strings, trees or graphs.
The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and
discussion of original research papers on all aspects of
grammatical inference including, but not limited to:

   * Theoretical aspects of grammatical inference: learning
paradigms, learnability results, complexity of learning.

   * Efficient learning algorithms for language classes inside and
outside the Chomsky hierarchy. Learning tree and graph grammars.
Learning distributions over strings, trees or graphs.

   * Grammatical inference from strings or trees paired with semantics representations,
or learning by situated agents and robots.

   * Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to
grammar induction, including artificial neural networks, statistical
methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic approaches,
minimum description length, complexity-theoretic approaches,
heuristic methods, etc.

   * Novel approaches to grammatical inference: Induction by DNA
computing or quantum computing, evolutionary approaches, new
representation spaces, etc.

   * Successful applications of grammatical inference to tasks in
natural language processing such as unsupervised parsing, bioinformatics,
web interface design, robot navigation,
machine translation, pattern recognition, language acquisition, software engineering,
computational linguistics, spam and malware detection, cognitive
psychology, etc.

Historically the roots of grammatical inference have been in the
modelling of first language acquisition by human infants: we especially
invite submissions that address this theme, directly or indirectly.

AUTHOR GUIDELINES
=================

We invite abstracts on work in progress, which can be either theoretical or experimental,
fundamental or application-oriented, solving or proposing important problems.

Abstracts will appear in a conference booklet and
a presentation should be given in the special session.

Prospective authors are invited to submit an abstract which
represents original and previously unpublished work.
Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published
proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions should conform to the guidelines that will be found on
the conference webpage.

All abstracts should be submitted by email to
  icgi2014@googlegroups.com
by July 21, 2014;

Papers must be submitted in pdf format. The use of LaTeX is strongly encouraged.
The users of Word may download a conversion tool to produce a PDF file for submission.
We have no special format request other than the following:

The total length of the abstract should not exceed 2 pages except for references
on A4 or letter-size paper with at least 1 inch margins and 11-point font.

Each abstract should contain title, authors and affiliation, mailing
address, and at least three keywords which can describe the contents of the work.

Please do not hesitate to contact us at icgi2014@googlegroups.com
or directly if you have questions.

We are looking forward to your submissions.
