IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
Paper Submission: February 28, 2015 (Extended)
Decision Notification: March 27, 2015
Camera-Ready Submission: April 10, 2015


The proliferation of online services and applications facilitated considera=
bly our lives. Nowadays we can easily communicate and share data with other=
 users using these services. On-line services are also a building corner of=
 ICT application such as e-commerce, e-government and e-health applications=
 that facilitate many administrative and personal tasks. However, several e=
merging issues and challenges have to be considered while setting up these =
future Internet services and applications. In particular, we explore three =
different key aspects of future Internet services and applications:
=E2=80=A2 Modeling, Provisioning and Management
=E2=80=A2 Data Protection
=E2=80=A2 Data Collection, Storage and Analysis

The goal of this track is to offer academic and industrial researchers and =
practitioners a platform for discussions related to these aspects of future=
 Internet services and applications.
