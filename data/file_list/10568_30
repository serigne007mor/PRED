http://www.socinfo2013.org
  

-----Paper submission deadline extended to August 1, 2013!!!---------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fifth International Conference on Social Informatics (SocInfo2013) is an interdisciplinary venue for researchers from informatics and the social & management sciences to come together to share ideas and opinions, and to present original research work. The goal is to create an opportunity for the dissemination of knowledge between the two communities, as well as to enable mutual critical discussion of current research.
  
The conference solicits original research and experience-based case study papers, as well as proposals for demonstrations. It welcomes interdisciplinary papers on methods from the social sciences in the study of information systems, applying information technology in the study of social phenomena, or applying social concepts in the design of information systems.
  
Detailed research topics of interest for this conference include, but are not limited to:
  
- Computational models of social phenomena and social simulation
- Social networks and communities: discovery, evolution, analysis, and applications
- Mining social big data
- Social behavior modeling
- Social Influence and diffusion models of social influence
- Web mining and its social interpretations
- Security, privacy, trust, reputation, and incentive issues
- Credibility of online content
- Opinion mining and social media analytics
- Design and analysis of Web2.0 applications (social or collaborative Web applications)
- Algorithms and protocols inspired by human societies
- Mechanisms for providing fairness in information systems
- Social choice mechanisms in the e-society
- Recommendation systems
- Social applications of the semantic Web
- Social system design and architectures
- Virtual communities (e.g., open-source, multiplayer gaming, etc.)
- Impact of technology on socio-economic, security, defense aspects
- Visualization of dynamic social networks
- Social interactions and collaboration
- Socio-economic systems and applications
- Social informatics theory
- Intelligence and social cognition
- Temporal characteristics of social media and social interactions
- Real-time analysis and visualization of social phenomena
- Evaluating sociability of applications
  
Submissions should be original and should be submitted in English in pdf format via the submission system:https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=socinfo2013
They should be formatted according to Springer LNCS format. The length of the research papers should not exceed 14 pages, while the demonstration submissions should be no longer than 6 pages.
As in the previous years, the accepted papers (research and demonstration) will appear in Lecture Note Series in Computer Science by Springer. Some of the research paper submissions can be accepted as short papers based on the decision of the Program Committee. More details on the conference and the submission guidelines can be found at the conference website.
