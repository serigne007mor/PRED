Subject: [liste-egc] CFP - CIRCLE 2020 | 15 March 2020 Joint Conference of
 the Information Retrieval,Communities in Europe

Dear all,

Deadlines have been changed for the call for papers. The call for 
applications for student grants is available 
(https://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE/registration/).

CFP - CIRCLE 2020 | Joint Conference of the Information Retrieval
Communities in Europe
July 6-9, 2020, Samatan, South of France
https://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE


Call for Contributions
------------------------

SCOPE
******
CIRCLE 2020 arose from a twofold wish to gather three national Information
Retrieval (IR) conferences and to offer young researchers the opportunity to
meet and discuss with senior researchers.

CIRCLE is supported by the ARIA French conference (CORIA, COnférence en
Recherche d’Information et Applications), the Spanish Conference on
Information Retrieval (CERI, Congreso Español de Recuperación de 
Información),
the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop, and the Swiss IR community.

The main objective of CIRCLE 2020 is to propose a unique place for 
stimulating
and disseminating research in IR, where senior/industrial and early stage
researchers (including MSc and PhD students) can network and discuss their
research results in a friendly environment. CIRCLE 2020 will take place on
July 6-9, 2020 at Samatan, Gers, south of France (50 minutes from Toulouse).
More information athttps://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE/

Participation in CIRCLE 2020 will be low fare charged.

IMPORTANT DATES
*****************
• 10 March 2020: Intention of submission (title and short abstract)
• 15 March 2020: Deadline for long paper submission
• 20 March 2020: Deadline for short papers and demos submissions
• 30 April 2020: Long paper, short paper, and demos notifications
• 29 May 2020: Deadline for camera-ready papers

TOPICS
********
CIRCLE 2020 offers an opportunity to present and discuss both 
theoretical and
empirical research. Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:
. Search and ranking
. Content analysis, recommendation and classification
. Domain-specific applications
. Artificial intelligence, semantics and dialog
. Human factors and interfaces
. Evaluation
. Future directions
See details at https://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE/call-for-papers/

SUBMISSIONS
*************
For the common track, submissions must be in English and in PDF using the
current ACM two-column conference format. The conference language for this
track will be English. Submission will be peer reviewed by at least 3
reviewers in a double blind process by the CIRCLE common program committee.
Submission will be through Easychair at
https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=circle2020. The proceedings will be
sent to CEUR-WS.org for online publication. Papers may range from 
theoretical
work, experimental research, to system and project descriptions.

Authors are invited to submit one of the following types of contributions:
. Long original papers (6 to 8 pages + 1 page for references)
. Short original papers (3 to 4 pages + 1 page for references)
. Extended abstracts containing descriptions of ongoing projects or 
presenting
already published results (up to 2 pages)

While long papers (6-8 pages plus up to 1 page for references) describe
mature and original research results, short papers (3-4 pages plus up to 1
page for references) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet
mature enough for a long paper, such as for example doctoral papers. In
particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for 
acceptance
into this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental
validation or lacking strong theoretical foundation. Extended abstracts 
(max.
2 pages) may include a system demonstration, a project presentation, an
already published piece of work (e.g. in a top level IR journal or
conference). Applications of information retrieval to novel areas are
especially welcome. Intention of submission (title and short abstract) 
will be
used for reviewers to bid on papers. Each accepted paper will be included in
the conference proceedings and orally presented.

There will be also CERI submissions: the Spanish Conference on Information
Retrieval will organize sessions with oral presentations in Spanish for
certain papers written in either Spanish or English. Special interest 
will be
devoted to papers on applications with municipal, regional or national 
impact
in Spain, collaborations from Spanish institutions and companies, or using
corpuses in Spanish. Short original papers or extended abstracts are 
allowed.
Note: as in previous editions of CERI (details will be given by the 
Spanish IR
associationhttp://seri.org.es) defended thesis from June 2018 to May 2020
could qualify for the SERI Award to the best Spanish PhD dissertation in IR.
