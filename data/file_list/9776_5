Subject: [liste-egc] ECAI 2012 Call for Demonstrations

Call for ECAI 2012 Demonstrations
www.lirmm.fr/ecai2012

Research and innovation in Artificial Intelligence continues to have
widespread success in many areas of society and has generated broad
excitement not only within our communities but also with the general
public. One of our more important roles as a community is to disseminate
research, applications and technologies in an accessible manner in
order to increase awareness of state-of-the-art in the area.

In order to share the excitement and increase the awareness of the
latest achievements in AI, the 20th European Conference in Artificial
Intelligence (ECAI 2012) invites demonstrations of state-of-the-art AI
systems.

The System Demonstrations track provides AI researchers and
practitioners an opportunity to demonstrate impressive and innovative
systems. We invite applications for demonstrations of a non-commercial
nature from universities, research institutes and industry.
Commercial demos may imply extra fees for booth usage. The aim of a
demonstration should be to make the attendees and participating public
aware of and enthusiastic about the work. It also provides an
opportunity to get feedback from the community.

There are two types of submissions:
* Demonstrations with a 2 page extended abstract describing the system.
* Demonstrations with a full 6 page technical paper describing the
    system as well as its scientific foundations.

Both types of submissions will be reviewed by the demo track program
committee using the standards of excellence associated with the ECAI
conferences. Evaluation will be based on novelty, relevance, scientific
contribution, maturity and excitement factor. The extended abstracts and
technical papers of accepted demonstrations will be published in the
official proceedings.

Demonstrations that can be used by the audience and/or that interact
with the audience are particularly encouraged.

An ECAI Best Systems Demonstration Award will be given to the best
demonstration based on both the opinion of the demo track committee and
a popular vote by the ECAI audience.

The demonstration program will include demonstration sessions
throughout the conference with the opportunity for interleaving static
presentations in the form of posters or videos and dynamic
presentations in the form of live demonstrations. The dynamic
presentations should be brief so that they can be shown repeatedly
during the conference. Videos of demonstrations will also be displayed
on monitors during the conference to increase the visibility of the
sessions. Novel ways of integrating demonstrations in live form as
part of the conference are encouraged so please contact the demo track
committee at an early stage if you have novel ideas in this respect.

All accepted submissions will be advertised on the ECAI 2012 website, in
the conference booklet and at the conference venue. Demonstrators are
required to register for the conference.

A submission consists of:
    * A 150-word summary of the demonstration in plain text. Please
      include title, demonstrator names, and affiliations. This summary
      will be used to compile a program for the demonstrations.
    * An obligatory 2 page system and demonstration description. If the
      demo is accepted these short papers will be published in the
      official proceedings.
    * An optional 6 page technical paper describing the system and its
      scientific foundation as well as the demonstration. If the demo
      and long paper are both accepted, this long paper will be
      published in the proceedings instead of the short paper.
    * A short video (less than 5 minutes) showing that a working system
      exists and that convinces the demo program committee that it is
      exciting, innovative and relevant and deserves to be highlighted
      at the conference.
    * A URL for a demo storyboard. A demo storyboard should consist of a
      detailed description of the demo, including images or slides
      depicting the various stages of the demo. If the video shows the
      demonstration then a separate storyboard is not required.
    * A detailed description of hardware and software requirements, such
      as space, power supplies, lighting, etc. Demonstrators are
      encouraged to be flexible in their requirements. Please state
      what you can bring yourself and what you absolutely must have
      provided at the venue. We will do our best to accommodate your
      needs.
