Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: ECML PKDD 2019 Demo Track

<html><head></head><body><div style="font-family: Verdana;font-size: 12.0px;"><div>
<div>** Call for Demos - ECML PKDD 2019 **</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We solicit submissions for demos for ECML PKDD 2019 in Wuerzburg, Germany. Demos present a valuable and unique opportunity to showcase innovative research and get direct feedback from the research community. Submissions should describe working systems and be based on state-of-the-art machine learning and data mining technology. Systems should demonstrate that they go beyond basic statistics and leverage machine learning techniques and knowledge discovery processes in a real setting. Commercial software systems are not acceptable.</div>

<div>The accepted demo papers will be included in the conference proceedings, to be published by Springer Verlag in the &quot;Lecture Notes in Computer Science&quot; (LNCS) series. The submissions have to also include a short promotional video.</div>

<div>The demos will be presented in a special demonstration session. At least one of the demo submitters must register for the conference, and perform the demo on site. This year, the proceedings will be published after the conference and will include only the papers that authors have presented at the conference. During the conference, camera-ready versions of the papers will be available for conference participants.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>** Submission Guidelines **</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>All aspects of the submission and notification process will be handled online via the ECML-PKDD 2019 Microsoft CMT submission site : https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ECMLPKDD2019 in the Demo Track. Instructions concerning the submission (except for the &quot;reproducible research&quot; part, which is not relevant for a demo paper), camera-ready formatting and copyright transfer for conference papers also hold for demo papers, unless otherwise specified.</div>

<div>The paper must provide adequate information on the system&#39;s components and the way the system is operated, including e.g. screenshots. Submitters should keep in mind that the description of a demo has inherently different content than a research paper submitted to the main conference. A successful demonstration paper should tackle the following questions:<br/>
- What are the innovative aspects or in what way/area does it represent the state of the art?<br/>
- Who are the target users and why is the system interesting/useful for them?<br/>
- If there are similar/related pieces of software, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the presented one?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>** Paper Format **</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>A demonstration submission must be up to 4 pages long. The paper should contain a URL linking to a demonstration video of no more than 5 minutes in duration showing and explaining the execution of the system. Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines. Author instructions, style files and copyright form can be downloaded at https://www.springer.com/fr/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>** Important dates **</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Demo submission deadline: Thursday, May 10, 2019<br/>
Notification of acceptance: Thursday, June 21, 2019<br/>
Camera-ready paper due: Friday, July 12, 2019<br/>
