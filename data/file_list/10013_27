Fifth International Workshop on Resource Discovery (RED)
                    May 27-31, 2012, Heraklion, Greece.
              At the 9th Extended Semantic Web Conference
                              (ESWC 2012)

Existing Web infrastructures such as the Semantic Web, Linking Data
Projects, and Semantic Grids have supported the publication of a tremendous
amount of resources. In order to provide users with the capability of using
available resources in their day-to-day tasks, scalable infrastructures and
efficient techniques to discover, select, and access resources are
required. Semantic descriptions of functionally and quality of resources as
well as user preferences, play an important role in the achievement of this
goal.
A resource may be a data repository, a database management system, a SPARQL
endpoint, a link between resources, an entity in a social network, a
semantic wiki, or a linked service. Resources are characterized by core
information including a name, a description of its functionality, its URLs,
and various additional Quality of Service parameters that express its
non-functional characteristics. Resource discovery is the process of
identifying, locating and selecting existing resources that satisfy
specific functional and non-functional requirements; also, resource
discovery includes the problem of predicting links between resources.
Current research includes crawling, indexing, ranking, clustering, and
rewriting techniques, for collecting and consuming the resources for a
specific request; additionally, processing techniques are required to
ensure an efficient and effective access of the resources.
The Fifth International Workshop on Resource Discovery aims at bringing
together researchers from the database, artificial intelligence and
semantic web areas, to discuss research issues and experiences in
developing and deploying concepts, techniques and applications that address
various issues related to resource discovery. Papers presenting theoretical
or applicative material are expected. This fifth edition will focus on
techniques to efficiently collect and consume resources that are
semantically described. Approaches for query rewriting in Databases,
service selection and composition in Service Oriented Architectures, social
network navigational techniques, link prediction techniques, and strategies
to process queries against Linked Data or SPARQL endpoints, can contribute
to solve the resource discovery problem, and are of special interest.

Workshop key dates:
----------------------------
 Full Paper Submission Deadline: March 4, 2012.
 Acceptance notification: April 1, 2012
 Camera ready: April 15, 2012.

and quality.
-) Resource Discovery and Social Networks.
-) Resource Discovery and Peer-to-Peer.
-) Resource Discovery query languages.
-) Applications to register, produce and consume resources, e.g. crawlers,
search engines,federated frameworks.
-) Query rewriting over Web resources such as Web Services and Linked
Datasets.
-) Cost-models and Optimization for Resource Discovery.
-) Link Prediction Techniques for Resource Discovery.

Submission Guidelines
--------------------------------
Long papers are limited to 15 pages and short papers to 8 pages.
