___________
The 21st IEEE International Conference on Information Integration and Reuse
(IRI'2020)
Las Vegas, USA, Aug. 11-13, 2020
https://homepages.uc.edu/~niunn/IRI20/call_papers.html
___________________________________________________________________________=
____________

Confirmed Keynote Speakers (so far):
https://homepages.uc.edu/~niunn/IRI20/speakers_keynotes.html

1. Dr. Elisa Bertino Samuel D. Conte Professor of Computer Science, Purdue
University, USA)
2. Dr. Bhavani Thuraisingham (Founders Chair Professor of Computer Science,
University of Texas at Dallas, USA)

---------------------
Journal Special Issues will be organized to include the top papers accepted
into IRI=E2=80=992020:

1. Intl. J. on Semantic Computing
2. Intl. J. on Multimedia Data Engineering and Management

This conference presents excellent, novel, and contemporary papers covering
all aspects of Data =E2=80=93 including Scientific Theory and Technology-Ba=
sed
Applications. New data analytic algorithms, technologies, and tools are
sought for data management in the face of hardware, software, and/or
bandwidth constraints; to construct models yielding important data
insights; and, to create visualizations to aid in presenting and
understanding the data. System development and integration need to adapt to
these new algorithms, technologies, tools, and needs. This conference and
its constituents support the development of science and technology to
improve the human condition.

Furthermore, IRI addresses the representation, cleansing, generalization,
validation, and reasoning strategies for the scientifically sound and the
cost-effective advancement of all systems and systems of systems (SoS) =E2=
=80=93
including all software and hardware aspects. These non-trivial tasks lead
to challenging research problems =E2=80=93 for example, how to optimally se=
lect the
information/data sets for reuse and how to optimize the integration of
existing information/knowledge with new, developing information/knowledge
sources!

The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners
from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange
ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions.
Theoretical and applied papers are both welcome. The conference program
will include several plenary speeches from academia, industry, and
government; special sessions, open forum workshops, and panels.

The conference includes, but is certainly not limited to, the areas listed
below:

* Applications =E2=80=93 Autonomous Vehicles, Business, Education, Engineer=
ing,
Healthcare and Medical Informatics, the * Internet of Things, Math,
Military, Multimedia, NLP, Robotics, Science, Security, Social Networking,
Space, Vision, etc.
* Brain-Computer Interface: Applications and Algorithms
* Contemporary as well as Novel Data Mining Techniques
* Data & Knowledge Representation and Management
* Data Science & Technologies - Heuristic Acquisition
* Data Science and Software Engineering =E2=80=93 Identify Security Bugs, C=
ode
Reviews, Adaptive Systems, Testing, etc.
* Data Visualization
* Graph Models
* Machine Learning & AI
* Heuristics, and Explanation-Based Learning vs. neural networks which are
intractable
* AI and Security
* Symbolic AI
* Evolutionary Techniques
* Predictive Data Analysis & Intelligence
* Recommender Systems
* Statistical Analysis
* Information Science & Theory

Best Paper Award: The best papers will be selected by distinct (cleared)
committees and will be the ones, which report novel and promising research
work, which have a high potential for world impact. Additional select
awards will also be made.

Instructions:

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining to
the above and related topics are solicited. Full/regular papers must be in
English of up to 8 pages (using the IEEE two-column template instructions).
Short papers are up to 6 pages, while poster and demo papers are up to 4
and 2 pages, respectively. Full paper submissions can be made to the
regular research track or to the industry/application track. Submissions
should be double blind and should include only the title and should not
include the author(s), affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), tel/fax numbers,
and postal address(es) in the paper. The online submission site is:
https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IRI2020. The authors need to mark if
their submission is for the =E2=80=9CRegular Research Track=E2=80=9D, or fo=
r the
=E2=80=9CIndustry/Applications Track=E2=80=9D.

If web submission is not possible, please contact the program co-chair, Dr.
Chengcui Zhang (czhang02@uab.edu) for alternate arrangements. Papers will
be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance,
relevance, and clarity of presentation. Paper submission implies the intent
of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper, if
accepted.
