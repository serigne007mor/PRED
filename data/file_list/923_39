1 PhD + 1 Year Post-Doctoral research positions on “flexible management 
of business processes” at LIMOS, University of Blaise Pascal, 
Clermont-Ferrand, France.


The PhD and Post-doc positions are part of a join project between the 
LIMOS laboratory  (University of Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, 
France) and the SOC (Service Oriented Computing) Group (University of 
New South Wales, Sydney, Australia). The project is funded by the 
Conseil Regional d’Auvergne.

The main goal of this project is to understand and achieve simple and 
flexible management of business processeses over heterogeneous 
Information Technology (IT) systems.  Business processes are central to 
the operation of both public and private organisations. They encompass 
both core processes that streamline the production and delivery of goods 
or services and support processes that enhance the efficiency of 
indirect activities and streamline the management of human resources. 
Given the importance of business process management to overall 
efficiency and effectiveness, the competitiveness of organisations 
hinges on continuous business process improvement. This project focuses 
on research and development of tools that enable to define, manage, 
share and reuse processes and process views over  heterogeneous IT 
systems without effort. Clearly this a very ambitious objective and the 
underlying research issues constitutes a grand challenge in computing, 
one whose investigations will require meaningful integration of concepts 
and techniques from various disciplines including SOAs, business process 
management, and the information sharing style of Web 2.0.

The work will be developed under the direct supervision of Boualem 
Benatallah (http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~boualem/) and Farouk Toumani 
(http://www.isima.fr/toumani/).

For more information about the positions, contact Farouk Toumani, email: 
ftoumani@isima.fr
Or Boualem Benatallah, email boualem.benatallah@gmail.com

To apply for the position, send an application to ftoumani@isima.fr, 
including a CV, references, and a master thesis and/or list of 
scientific papers indicating where each has been published.
