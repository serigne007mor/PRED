Call for papers
Fifth International Conference

Concept Lattices and Their Applications=20
*
Montpellier, France, October 24-26, 2007

********************
Selected papers accepted to CLA 2007 will be invited to further revise and =
extend their work in a special issue of=20
International Journal of General Systems, http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/t=
itles/03081079.asp=20
on Concept Lattices and Applications. Selected papers will be competitively=

****** *****************


Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a mathematical tool for analyzing data=20
and
formally representing conceptual knowledge. FCA helps forming conceptual
structures from data. Such structures consist of units, which are formal
abstractions of concepts of human thought allowing meaningful and=20
comprehensible
interpretation. FCA is a mathematical discipline whose features include:
* Visualizing inherent properties in data sets,
* Interactively exploring attributes of objects and their corresponding
contexts, and
* Formally classifying systems based on relationships among objects and
attributes through the concept of mathematical lattices.

As an aside, FCA mathematical settings have recently been shown to=20
provide a
theoretical framework for the efficient resolution of many practical
problems
from data mining, software engineering and information retrieval.
CLA is an international conference devoted to both theoretical and=20
applicational
aspects of formal concept analysis (FCA). Papers in the above areas of
interest
are solicited:
* foundations of FCA
* mathematical structures related to FCA (concept lattices, Galois
connections,=20
closure structures, attribute implications)
* algorithms for FCA
* relationship of FCA to other methods of data analysis (clustering,
association
rules, classification, etc.)
* visualization of data in FCA=20
* data for FCA (object-attribute data, preprocessing of data, conceptual
scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.)
* applications of FCA (knowledge discovery, data mining, information
retrieval,
ontology, semantic web, etc.)=20
* Other related areas

All papers will be judged based on their technical merits, originality,
relevance to areas of interest of CLA 2007, and presentation clarity.
Papers should describe original work that has not been published before, is=
=20
not under review elsewhere, and will not be submitted elsewhere during CLA =
2007's review
period.
