We invite researchers working on interpretability and explainability in ML/=
AI, and related topics, to submit regular (14 pages, single column) or shor=
t (7 pages, single column) papers to the AIMLAI workshop that will be held =
at ECML/PKDD 2023. This year the workshop will feature a tutorial on Explai=
nable GraphML.=20

Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daimlai2023=20
Submission deadline: June 27, 2023=20

The purpose of AIMLAI (Advances in Interpretable Machine Learning and Artif=
icial Intelligence) is to encourage principled research that will lead to t=
he advancement of explainable, transparent, ethical and fair data mining, m=
achine learning, and artificial intelligence. AIMLAI is a workshop that see=
ks top-quality submissions addressing uncovered important issues related to=
 explainable and interpretable data mining and machine learning models. Pap=
ers should present novel research results in any of the topics of interest =
for the workshop as well as application experiences, tools and promising pr=
eliminary ideas. AIMLAI asks for contributions from researchers, academia, =
and industry working on topics addressing these challenges primarily from a=
 technical point of view, but also from a legal, ethical or sociological pe=
rspective. Besides the central topic of interpretable algorithms and explan=
ation methods, we also welcome submissions that answer research questions l=
ike "how to measure and evaluate interpretability and explainability?" and =
"how to integrate humans in the machine learning pipeline for interpretabil=
ity purposes?". This year's edition of AIMLAI is open to two kinds of submi=
ssions: regular papers (14 pages) and short papers (7 pages) in a single co=
lumn format.=20

A non-exhaustive list of topics that are of interest for AIMLAI are the fol=
lowing:=20

- Interpretable ML=20
- Supervised and Unsupervised ML=20
- Explaining recommendation models=20
- Multimodal explanations=20
- Interpretable/Explainable GraphML=20
Transparency in AI and ML=20
- Ethical aspects=20
- Legal aspects=20
- Fairness issues=20
Methodology and formalization of interpretability=20
- Formal measures of interpretability=20
- Interpretability/complexity trade-offs=20
- How to evaluate interpretability=20
User-centric interpretability=20
- Explanation modules=20
- Interpretability and Semantics: how to add semantics to explanations?=20
- Human-in-the-loop to construct and/or evaluate interpretable models=20
- Integration of ML algorithms, infovis and man-machine interfaces=20

The workshop will be a full-day event that will feature a half-day tutorial=
 on Explainable GraphML covering, among others, the topics of post-hoc expl=
ainability for graph neural networks (GNNs), knowledge graph embeddings (KG=
E), and explainable-by-design GraphML.=20

Submission Guidelines=20
Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the Springer L=
NCS (http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceeding=
s-guidelines) guidelines. Regular papers must be 14 pages long maximum. Sho=
rt papers are restricted to a maximum of 7 pages. In both cases the page li=
mit excludes references, for which there is no limit. Overlength papers wil=
l be rejected without review (papers with smaller page margins and font siz=
es than specified in the author instructions and set in the style files wil=
l also be treated as overlength).=20
Authors who submit their work to AIMLAI 2023 commit themselves to present t=
heir paper at the workshop in case of acceptance. AIMLAI 2023 considers the=
 author list submitted with the paper as final. No additions or deletions t=
o this list may be made after paper submission, either during the review pe=
riod, or in case of acceptance, at the final camera ready stage.=20
Condition for inclusion in the post-proceedings is that at least one of the=
 co-authors has (in-person or virtually) presented the paper at the worksho=
p.=20
All papers for AIMLAI 2023 must be submitted by using the online submission=
 system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daimlai2023.=20
