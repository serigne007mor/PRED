The International World Wide Web Conference (WWW) is an annual internationa=
l conference on the topics of the future direction of the World Wide Web. W=
WW aims to bring together the researchers and practitioners from various di=
sciplines in academia and industry to tackle the emerging challenges in the=
 evolution of the Web and the standardization of its associated technologie=
s, as well as the impact of those technologies on society and culture. We i=
nvite original contributions on topics related to the Semantic Web, includi=
ng (but not limited to) the ones below.=20

The conference will be held at Seoul, the heart of the Korean culture and e=

orea's last dynasty for six hundred years and it is the home of many histor=
ic sites including royal palaces and places of traditional cultures such as=
 traditional Korean villages and traditional market places.=20
