> The concept of a model has now become very important. In complex 
> systems, good models allow to achieve autonomy and independence of the 
> components of the system, better and efficient development and 
> maintenance of them. But to achieve these objectives, several types of 
> models should be built by using different languages. For instance, an 
> enterprise must necessarily use models defined in different languages 
> for strategic positioning and production management. In process 
> management, models in distinct languages for respectively expressing 
> business processes and for realising these processes are required. 
> Additionally, some languages can be used to expressing distinct 
> aspects of a complex system..
>
> Therefore, the key point to achieve the objectives claimed above can 
> be paraphrased by saying that it is required to establish 
> relationships on models for guaranteeing effective usage of them and 
> for guaranteeing they are not contradictory. Establishing those 
> relationships is usually approached in the following two ways 
> according to what is known among languages:
>
> - relationships between distinct languages in which models are 
> expressed are known, because universally accepted or formally provable;
>
> - relationships between languages are not known, neither universally 
> accepted nor formally provable, therefore all models in distinct 
> languages are reproduced in only one language, so that relationships 
> within the same language are known, universally accepted or formally 
> provable.
>
> Both ways are limited while effective. Indeed, the first way is 
> relevant only for languages used for long time (e.g. 
> entity-relationship model and relational data model) so that a good 
> understanding of relationships between them is known and universally 
> accepted. In other situations, relationships have been standardised 
> (e.g. programming languages to CORBA – Common Object Request Broker 
> Architecture -). In yet other situations, these relationships are 
> formally provable but only because languages are fully formalised (and 
> their formalisations are universally accepted) (e.g. process algebra 
> variants and Petri nets). However, in these last situations, universal 
> acceptance is not guaranteed by the formal proofs only.
>
> In the second way, one difficulty is to provide a well-accepted unique 
> language. An additional difficulty raises because models natively 
> expressed in a language should be rewritten in the unique language and 
> this procedure is not error-free, possibly biased, inefficient and, 
> because models change, continuously needed. This unique language can 
> be only defined for the purpose of establishing relationships or with 
> the purpose to substitute the various languages. The most important 
> essay with this last purpose is UML (Unified Modeling Language). In 
> the domain of knowledge representation, CL (common logics) and KIF 
> (knowledge interchange format) are notable examples of first purpose. 
> Recently, a relatively new concept “ontology” is also used for 
> abstracting not relevant details of models and putting all models in 
> one language.
>
> Based on the limitations advocated above, we are proposing a third way 
> which is named UEML – Unified Enterprise Modelling Language - (or UEML 
> approach). The earlier works are summarised in the next section. The 
> most important and remarkable features of UEML are:
>
>     * UEML is based on precise ontological analysis of languages (name
>       /language incorporation /in UEML), being available analysis made
>       operational and usable through available tools; achievement on
>       common agreement on language incorporation is then based on
>       building a consensus in a distributed manner;
>     * UEML is not limited in languages, then additional languages can
>       be added (or incorporated) as needed;
>     * In UEML, the available ontological analysis can be used to
>       discover in a semi-automated way, relationships between
>       languages (called /correspondences/ in UEML terminology).
>
> *Earlier works*
>
> The UEML approach has been developed in the network of excellence 
> INTEROP and more specifically in the work package DEM (Domain 
> Enterprise Modeling). The UEML approach – supporting by several 
> computerise tools - is an ontological approach for describing 
> modelling languages and finding out semantic correspondences between 
> constructs of those languages. There is already a set of modelling 
> languages that have been fully or partially incorporated in the 
> UEMLBase tool using the UEML ontology. The UEML ontology is evolving 
> and eventually enriched by using the ontological analysis of language 
> constructs. The starting point from which the UEML ontology is growing 
> is the well-know BWW’s model and Bunge ontology. This allows a greater 
> flexibility and adaptation of the ontology to languages meaning. 
> Therefore, the UEML ontology will be finalized and stabilized when a 
> sufficient number of languages is incorporated.
> However, once several constructs are incorporated, it is possible to 
> establish semantic correspondences (equivalence or order) between 
> them. These correspondences can be identified or discovered by using 
> semantic measures for comparing concepts already developed in the 
> ontology area.
>
> Currently, the ontology UEML is not yet stable: its structure and 
> content is evolving. Similarly, the incorporation of language 
> constructs is not validated. Therefore, the usage of correspondences 
> focuses on ontology enrichment and construct incorporation validation. 
> A list of semantic measures has been already implemented and applied 
> on the constructs incorporated into the UEMLBase.
>
>
>     Project objectives:
>
> The overall objective of this postdoctoral is to develop the 
> underlying theory and an interface between */model editors/* and 
> */UEMLbase tool /*for transforming models defined in an model editor 
> to models defined within another editor, by using the degree of 
> correspondence between constructs found within the UEMLBase. For that, 
> the successful candidate has to choice or define a declarative 
> language for model mapping. Additionally, he/she will be involved in 
> the analysis concerning the various semantic measures to be used for 
> discovering correspondences. Indeed, this analysis will be performed 
> by taking into account an evaluation of generated model 
> transformations. This will allow analysing and increasing the UEML 
> practical interest.
