*Abstract : *

We all would like to have cars that could drive themselves safely while=20
we relax and read the newspaper. The military would like vehicles that=20
could navigate autonomously on or off road for a wide range of missions.=20
How far are we from achieving these goals?

DARPA has taken the lead in advancing the science and engineering needed=20
to field practical Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). Some of this effort=20
was showcased in the DARPA Grand Challenge and Urban Challenge events.=20
There have also been large DARPA programs that have had less public=20
exposure, but nevertheless have made major contributions to autonomous=20
UGV navigation and locomotion.

 From 2003 to 2007 I was fortunate to be a Program Manager at DARPA with=20
primary responsibility for many of DARPA's UGV efforts. In this talk I=20
will give an overview of the state of the field and review the progress=20
of recent years. An emphasis of my DARPA programs was the application of=20
machine learning and rapid adaptation to UGV tasks; I will discuss how=20
this approach played out in the LAGR, UPI and Learning Locomotion=20
programs. Finally, I will describe additional research challenges that=20
must be overcome before a UGV is likely to drive itself by your front door.

This talk will be at an "overview" level, featuring numerous videos of=20
robots in action.

Bio:

Larry Jackel is President of North-C Technologies, where he does=20
professional consulting. From 2003-2007 he was a DARPA Program Manager=20
in the IPTO and TTO offices. He conceived and managed programs in=20
Universal Network-Based Document Storage and in Autonomous Ground Robot=20
navigation and Locomotion. For most of his scientific career Jackel was=20
a manager and researcher in Bell Labs and then AT&T Labs. He has created=20
and managed research groups in Microscience and Microfabrication, in=20
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, and in Carrier-Scale Telecom=20
Services. Jackel holds a PhD in Experimental Physics from Cornell=20
University with a thesis in superconducting electronics. He is a Fellow=20
of the American Physical Society and the IEEE.
