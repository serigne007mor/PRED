A fully funded PhD position is open at the University of Strasbourg (ICube)=
. The position will be jointly funded by the French [ https://cnes.fr/fr/ |=
 National Centre for Space Studies ] (CNES) and the Chair SDIA. The candida=
te will join the SDC research team under the supervision of Dr Thomas Lampe=
rt, the [ https://sites.google.com/view/chairdsai/home | Chair of Data Scie=
nce and Artificial Intelligence ] , and join his international team to deve=
lop novel deep learning approaches to domain invariant representation learn=
ing for satellite image time-series (SITS).=20
Domain invariant interpretable representation learning for satellite image =
time-series=20


The goal of the project is to develop models for learning domain invariant =
representations using deep learning for the analysis of satellite image tim=
e-series.=20

It is difficult and expensive to annotate the huge amount of data generated=
 by satellites, but this is needed for the success of deep learning algorit=
hms. To overcome this, transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques w=
ill be developed to exploit unlabelled data. These techniques allow an algo=
rithm=E2=80=99s performance to be improved with minimal (or potentially no)=
 additional annotation, lowering the cost of deployment.=20


The successful candidate will have (or will soon obtain) an MSc in Computer=
 Science or related subject. Experience with deep learning is required and =
experience with time series and/or remote sensing is a bonus.=20


Send a letter of motivation, transcript of grades, and your CV to Thomas La=
mpert (l1ampert@uni2stra.fr - !remove the numbers!) with the subject beginn=
ing with [CNES PhD].=20
The application deadline is 15/3/2022 and the starting date will be Septemb=
er 2022 (or soon after).=20
