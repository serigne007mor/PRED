				      LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

			   The 2006 International Conference on
		SIGNAL-IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET- BASED SYSTEMS (SITIS 06)
				    Sponsored by IEEE and ACM

			     December 17th - December 21st 2006
				     The MARCO POLO Hotel
				      Hammamet, Tunisia
			     http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/sitis

The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to
represent,
share and process information in various forms, ranging from signal, image, and
multimedia
data to traditional data and semi-structured data found in the web.
SITIS 2006 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on research
activities
centered on three main tracks.

The focus of the first track "Information Management & Retrieval Technologies"
(IMRT)
is on the emerging modeling, representation and retrieval techniques that take
into account
the amount, type and diversity of information accessible in distributed
computing environment.
The main topics of Interest include:

- Data Semantics
- Spatial Information Systems and Applications
- Multimedia and application
- Information security.

The second track "Web-Based Information Technologies & Distributed Systems"
(WITDS) is devoted to
emerging and novel concepts, architectures and methodologies for creating
interconnected environments
in which information can be exchanged easily, tasks can be processed
collaboratively, and communities
of users with similarly interests can be formed while addressing security
threats that are present
more than ever before. The main topics of Interest include:

- Information System Interoperability
- Emergent semantics
- Agent-based systems
- Distributed, Parallel, GRID, P2P, Mobile information management
- Web-Centric Systems

The third track "Signal & Image Technologies" (SIT) focuses on recent
developments in digital signal
processing and pays particular attention to evolutions in audiovisual signal
processing, analysis, coding
and authentication, and retrieval techniques. The main topics of Interest
include:

- Image Processing and Analysis
- Image/Video Coding and Authentication
- Signal processing
- Applications



Submissions must be in electronic form as PDF or PS files and should be uploaded
through the SITIS 2006 Web site.
Submissions should be 3000-4000 words long (approx. 8-12 double-space printed
pages).
Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 qualified reviewers.
Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originality,
technical soundness,
and quality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take
strong or challenging positions
on important emergent topics. At least one author should attend the conference
to present the paper.
The printed proceedings will be post-published by the Springer-Verlag.

Tutorial and Workshop proposals should be submitted to sitis@u-bourgogne.fr.

IMPORTANT DATES:
---------------

Paper submission (Revised)                     : September 20th, 2006
Notification of acceptance (Revised)           : October   20th, 2006
Final version paper with registration (Revised): November  15th, 2006
