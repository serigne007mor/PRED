Subject: [liste-egc] PhD position in AI and NLP on science and
 disinformation in online discourse - Montpellier France

-- Apologies for cross-posting --

Dear colleagues,

A PhD position in hybrid AI (knowledge graphs and NLP) is open at the 
University of Montpellier. We are looking for applicants.

Detailed description:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSbd1t8F5_QsOcff1gfJuZR7I_MKvcNVEEylshZULauQhjXS-R14F69ENPci2dmVM6Oh4NXL033bdqO/pub

Please share among your students and colleages.

Below is a summary of the position.

Cheers,
Konstantin



Title: Detection, linking and interpretation of science-related claims 
and their contexts from online discourse

Keywords: Natural language processing, Knowledge graphs, Machine 
learning, Representation learning, Online discourse, Science and 
controversy

Context: The PhD position is part of the ANR French-German project 
AI4Sci, co-funded by the Minister of Higher Education, Research and 
Innovation France (MESRI) and the Federal Minister of Education and 
Research Germany (BMBF). AI4Sci analyzes the insertion of claims related 
to science in societal debates (social networks or other media), 
particularly in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and in particular in 
connection with controversial topics (e.g. vaccines, health protocols, 
etc.). The project aims to answer the questions how science feeds these 
debates, how scientific facts, often taken out of context or downright 
falsified, are used (or "misused") to support specific stances and how 
they are instrumentalized to serve (political or ideological) agendas. 
The project contributes to the global fight against disinformation, by 
placing AI technology at the service of sociologists and experts in the 
field of life sciences who study the questions raised above.  The 
project brings together GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social 
Sciences, Cologne (Germany) and LIRMM - Laboratory of Computer Science, 
Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier (France). The successful 
candidate will collaborate closely with a PhD student at GESIS, working 
on a complementary topic within the project, as well as with a team of 
young researchers (PhD and postdocs) at GESIS and LIRMM, benefiting from 
infrastructure, resources and software already developed in the 
framework of previous or ongoing projects of the two institutes.

Application: Applications for this position will be received EXCLUSIVELY 
in a single PDF document accessible for download via email sent to 
Konstantin Todorov (todorov@lirmm.fr). For more information:
