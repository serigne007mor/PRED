CONTENT-BASED MULTIMEDIA INDEXING

University of Lille, Cit=C3=A9 scientifique, Villeneuve d=E2=80=98Ascq, Fra=
nce, 28-30 June 2021

cbmi2021.univ-lille.fr

CBMI (eighteenth edition) aims at bringing together the various communities=
 involved in all aspects of content-based multimedia indexing for retrieval=
, browsing, management, visualization and analytics. Topics of interest to =
the CBMI community include, but are not limited to, the following: audio an=
d visual and multimedia indexing, multimodal and cross-modal indexing, deep=
 learning for multimedia indexing, visual content extraction, audio (speech=
, music, etc.) content extraction, identification and tracking of semantic =
regions and events, social media analysis=E2=80=A6

The eighteenth edition of CBMI will be organized by the CRIStAL laboratory =
at University of Lille, Lille, France, following the successful previous ed=
itions of Toulouse 1999, Brescia 2001, Rennes 2003, Riga 2005, Bordeaux 200=
7, London 2008, Chania 2009, Grenoble 2010, Madrid 2011, Annecy 2012, Veszp=
rem 2013, Klagenfurt 2014, Prague 2015, Bucharest 2016, Firenze 2017, La Ro=
chelle 2018, and Dublin 2019.

Authors are encouraged to submit previously unpublished research papers in =
the broad field of content-based multimedia indexing and applications. We w=
ish to highlight significant contributions addressing the main problem of s=
earch and retrieval but also the related and equally important issues of mu=
ltimedia content management, user interaction, large-scale search, learning=
 in retrieval, social media indexing and retrieval. Additional special sess=
ions are planned in areas such as deep learning for retrieval, social media=
 retrieval, cultural heritage, surveillance and security.

Authors can submit full length (6 pages - to be presented as oral presentat=
ion) or short papers (4 pages - to be presented as posters). Papers can be =
submitted to the regular paper sessions, demo session, or to one of the spe=
cial sessions. Additionally demonstration papers (up to 4 pages) may also b=
e submitted that highlight interesting and novel demos of CBMI-related tech=
nologies. The submissions are peer reviewed in a single blind process. The =
language of the conference is English. The CBMI 2020 conference adheres to =
the IEEE paper formatting guidelines. When preparing your submission, pleas=
e follow the IEEE guidelines given by IEEE at the Manuscript Templates for =
Conference Proceedings.

The CBMI proceedings are traditionally indexed and distributed by IEEE Xplo=
re and ACM DL. In addition, authors of certain best papers of the conferenc=
e will be invited to submit extended versions of their contributions to a s=
pecial issue of a leading journal in the field (e.g. MTAP - Springer), and =
other best papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their cont=
ributions in a book (ISTE/WILEY publisher).

he following:
=E2=80=A2 Audio and visual and multimedia indexing
=E2=80=A2 Multimodal and cross-modal indexing

DATES:
Conference date : 28-30 June 2021, at Lille, France.
Contact: cbmi2021-organisation@univ-lille.fr
Deadline for regular paper and demo submissions : 15 January 2021
Notification of acceptance : 15 March 2021
Camera-ready papers due : 30 March 2021

STUDENT PARTICIPATION:
We strongly encourage students to participate in CBMI-21 event and submit t=
heir research. We strongly believe in their power and they are the future o=
f the research in content-based multimedia indexing. For these reasons and =
for the first time in the history of the conference, the 2021 edition of CB=
MI with support of ACM SIGMM (www.sigmm.org), will sponsor several students=
, authors of papers submitted and accepted by CBMI-21, and being correspond=
ing author of a paper. The student status will be recognized only to PhDs a=
nd master students. Certain students will be totally sponsored, including r=
egistration fees, accommodations and travel expenses. Other students will b=
e partly sponsored, including substantial reduction in the registration fee=
s, no cut-backs to the students=E2=80=99 conference experience, and budget =
accommodation options and arrangement for room sharing.

Furthermore, in this edition, prizes will be awarded to the best student po=
ster presentations of CBMI2021. All the participants registered to CBMI2021=
 as student will be automatically admitted to the selection for the awards.=
 All the papers accepted as poster presentation by the Technical Program Co=
mmittee (TPC), from students will be considered for the awards, given that =
a full-paper manuscript has been submitted.

The student poster awards committee will evaluate the nominated contributio=
ns during the poster sessions of CBMI2021. The evaluation criteria will be =
independently established by the Committee before the conference and will t=
ake into account the scientific content as well as the technical quality of=
 the posters.

The Student Poster Awards will be announced during the Gala Dinner, on June=
 29th.
