Dear Colleague,

The INRIA Lille centre is actively seeking candidates for a junior 
professorship. This chair allows the financing of the researcher's 
salary for 3 to 6 years in order to allow him/her to obtain a senior 
INRIA researcher position.

This chair also contains the budget for two PhD students, a 
post-doctoral researcher and an engineer that the candidate can recruit 
to support his work.

The candidate will join the ENDOMIC team which will soon be a joint 
INSERM and INRIA team. It currently includes physicians, pharmacists and 
researchers in biology, as well as a post-doctoral fellow in computer 
science and an engineer in data science. They would be delighted to be 
joined by a colleague with expertise in computer science, artificial 
intelligence and/or statistics to lead the projects in tandem with a 
professor of medicine caring for patients with chronic inflammatory 
diseases.

This is already a dynamic team with a variety of medical data sources 
(clinical, biological, images and omics) working in a very welcoming 
environment, close to the hospital and biological research centres.

If you know of a young colleague who is interested and who might have 
the profile of a senior INRIA researcher in the short term, could you 
please encourage him/her to apply?

Candidates should submit their applications before May 21, 2023

Many thanks

Best regards
