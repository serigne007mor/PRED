**Call for Tutorials**
**Document Analysis Systems (15th IAPR International Workshop on)**
**May 21-22, 2022, La Rochelle, France and remote**

Submission deadline: March 1st, 2022


*OVERVIEW*

The DAS 2022 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials that 
are cutting edge, accessible to a wide audience, and delivered by 
world-class speakers. Tutorials can provide a survey of recent 
literature on the topic, and/or a graduate-level treatment of the topic. 
Tutorial proposals in all areas of document analysis are encouraged, 
especially those related to the themes of the conference.

DAS Tutorials will be held on Saturday and Sunday, May 21 and 22, 2022.

DAS tutorials should aim to give a comprehensive overview of a specific 
topic related to DAS. A good tutorial should be educational rather than 
just a cursory survey of techniques. The topic should be of sufficient 
relevance and importance to attract significant interest from the DAS 
community. Typical tutorial audiences consist of Ph.D. students, 
researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry.

To facilitate innovative collaboration and interaction between 
researchers in academia and industry,  the Tutorial Chairs strongly 
encourage proposals for industrial tutorials, in which researchers in 
companies describe DAS systems and overview industrial solutions to 
document analysis problems in real use-case industrial scenarios.


*SUBMISSION FORMAT*

Proposals should be up to 4 pages in length, and should contain the 
following information:
● Title of the tutorial.
● Scope and motivation. A brief description of the tutorial, suitable 
for inclusion in the conference registration brochure.
● Preference for the duration (full day or half day). Due to agenda 
constraints, half day tutorials are recommended. If a full day is 
needed, provide a brief justification.
● A detailed outline of the tutorial. Course description with list of 
topics to be covered, along with a brief outline.
● Relevance for DAS. A description of why the tutorial topic would be of 
interest to a substantial part of the DAS audience.
● Expected target audience in terms of composition and estimated number 
of attendees.  Prerequisite knowledge of the DAS audience for attending 
the tutorial.
● Short CV of organizers. A brief CV of the presenter(s), including 
name, postal address, phone number, e-mail address, web page, background 
in the tutorial area (projects, relevant publications, or tutorial-level 
articles on the subject), evidence of teaching experience.
● The name and e-mail address of the corresponding presenter. The 
corresponding presenter should be available for e-mail correspondence 
during the evaluation process, in the case clarifications and 
discussions on the scope and content of the proposal are needed.
● A statement if the authors of the proposal, if accepted, would be 
willing to contribute with a paper up to 15 pages in Springer LNCS 
format, to be included in the proceedings.


*EVALUATION*

The evaluation of the proposal will consider its general interest for 
DAS attendees, the quality of the proposal (e.g., a tutorial that simply 
lists a set of concepts without any apparent rationale behind them will 
not be approved) as well as the expertise and skills of the presenters. 
The primary criteria for evaluation will be whether a proposal is 
interesting, well-structured, and motivated in relation to Document 
Analysis and Recognition, rather than the perceived experience/standing 
of the proposer.

Finally, the tutorial should attract a meaningful audience, cover hot 
topics, and incorporate new knowledge to the community. Those submitting 
a proposal should keep in mind that tutorials are intended to provide an 
overview of the field; they should present reasonably well-established 
information in a balanced way. Tutorials should not be used to advocate 
a single avenue of research,  nor should they promote a product.


*NOTES*

● Tutorial slides must be provided to us for inclusion on the conference 
website and on the TC 10 and TC-11 websites, as educational material.
● The DAS main conference organizers will handle the tutorial 
registration and provide the space,  coffee breaks and other facilities 
required to organize tutorials (e.g. a room, a projector and a screen,  
computers for hands-on activities).


*SUBMISSION GUIDELINES AND INQUIRIES*

All proposals should be submitted by electronic mail to the Tutorial 
Chairs:
● Alicia Fornés (afornes@cvc.uab.es )
● Rafael Dueire Lins (rdl@cin.ufpe.br )

Feedback, comments and/or suggestions would be provided within one week 
of receiving the proposal. Final acceptance (or rejection) would be 
decided by March 8th, 2022.

For any inquiries you may have, please contact us via the above emails.


*IMPORTANT DATES *

● Proposal Due: March 1st, 2022
● Acceptance Notification: March 8th, 2022
● Dates of Tutorials: May 21 - 22, 2022
