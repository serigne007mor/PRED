Subject: [liste-egc] 2nd Call for Posters and Demos ESWC 2013

10th ESWC 2013 - Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013, Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/

==== *Call for Posters and Demos* ====


*Call for Posters*

The poster track of the ESWC2013 will provide an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Posters are intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect with each other and to engage in discussions about the work.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Web and which address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track. Technical posters, reports on semantic systems, descriptions of completed work, and work in progress are equally welcome.

Papers submitted to the research track will NOT automatically be considered for the poster track. A separate poster submission must be made. For example, a poster can be used to present work that was insufficiently mature for the research track.

Authors must submit a 2-page paper (PDF, Springer LNCS style) with a short abstract for evaluation. The paper must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ESWC 2013. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

*Call for Demos*

The demonstrations track of the ESWC2013 complements the overall program of the conference with demonstrations of real-world, proven-and-tested advances of semantic technologies. In addition to papers and posters presenting latest theoretical achievements, the ESWC2013 is seeking demonstrations of novel applications of semantics in various sectors, including: eGovernment,  eEnvironment, eMobility and smart cities, eHealth, Life Sciences, Sensor networks, Media and entertainment, Telecommunications, Cultural heritage, Financial services, Energy and utilities, Manufacturing, Digital libraries, Cloud applications, Personal Information Management, etc.

The demonstrations track is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their innovative prototypes, practical developments, on-going projects, lessons learned and late-breaking results, relevant for the topics of interest of the main conference and the research and poster tracks.

Submissions to the demonstrations track should make clear what will be demonstrated. A video of the demo should be provided if a link to the demonstrator is not available.  Submission should also specify:
* What is the research background and application context of the demonstration
* What is the key technology used, and how does the demonstrated system, application or infrastructure relate to pre-existing work
* What exactly will be demonstrated? What exactly will a visitor of the demonstration learn?

Submissions to the demonstrations track must be in form of a textual description of the demonstration to be given at the conference (which may include screenshots and a link or a video to the demo). The submissions must be at most 5 pages long (Springer LNCS style) and submitted as PDF. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web area, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.
