> This is the second call for papers for the 8th Workshop on Geographic Inf=
ormation Retrieval (GIR'14), to be held on 4th November 2014 in conjunction=
 with the ACM SIGSPATIAL 2014 conference in Dallas, Texas. The workshop con=
tinues the successful series of workshops held previously in cooperation wi=
th ACM SIGSPATIAL and in conjunction with SIGIR and CIKM conferences.
>=20
>=20
> The purpose of the workshop is to bring together members of the vibrant a=
nd growing community of researchers and practitioners working in the field =
of geographic information retrieval to discuss current research activity an=
d potential future research directions.
>=20
>=20
> The subject and format of the workshop
> -----------------------------------------------------
>=20
> There is a vast quantity of information in text documents and other media=
 that is referenced to geographic space. The discipline of Geographical Inf=
ormation Retrieval (GIR) is concerned with developing methods to gain acces=
s to this geographical information, with a particular focus on the content =
of web documents and social media. Because much of the information is in th=
e form of unstructured or semi-structured text, there is a challenge to dev=
elop methods that can automatically recognise and interpret the geographica=
l terminology and spatial or spatio-temporal concepts that people use when =
recording and querying the information. GIR falls at the intersection of In=
formation Retrieval (IR) and Geographical Information Science (GIScience) r=
esulting in research and systems development that benefits from the fusion =
of text-based methods for information extraction, natural language processi=
ng, indexing and search with GIS methods for spatial data management, analy=
sis and visual!
iz!
> ation.=20
>=20
> The workshop invites contributions on the following topics, and other res=
earch related to GIR:
>=20
> =B7         Detection, disambiguation and geocoding of geographical refer=
ences in text;
>=20
> =B7         User needs for geographic search;
>=20
> =B7         Classification of web documents and social media with regard =
to their geographic foci;
>=20
> =B7         Interpretation of spatial natural language in documents and q=
ueries;
>=20
> =B7         Extraction of geographically-specific facts and events from t=
ext documents and social media;
>=20
> =B7         Spatial and spatio-temporal indexing of documents and other m=
edia objects;
>=20
> =B7         Modelling, construction and integration of ontologies, gazett=
eers and geographic thesauri;
>=20
> =B7         Reasoning with geo-spatial facts for purposes of information =
retrieval;
>=20
> =B7         Geographical query interfaces for search on the web;
>=20
> =B7         Geographic question / answering systems;
>=20
> =B7         Geographic search engine architectures;
>=20
> =B7         Relevance ranking of geographical information;
>=20
> =B7         Evaluation methods for geographic search.
>=20
> We invite both long papers (8 pages) and short papers (2 pages). Long pap=
ers are expected to report on relatively mature research results, while sho=
rt papers may also cover more speculative or early stage research that may =
stimulate discussion at the workshop.
>=20
> All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the programme commit=
tee and all accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
>=20
> Please note that we welcome contributions both from academic researchers =
and from practitioners working in industry and in public agencies engaged i=
n GIR-related activities.
>=20
> The workshop programme will ensure opportunity for discussion of the pres=
ented papers and of the broader agenda for research in GIR.
>=20
> Submission procedure
> ------------------------------
> You should prepare your paper in accordance with the ACM camera-ready ins=
tructions (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) and =
submit it using the EasyChair system (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/=
?conf=3Dgir14) by 29th August 2014. Decisions on acceptance will be announc=
ed by 15th September 2014.
>=20
> Camera ready versions of accepted papers to be submitted by 29th Septembe=
r 2014.
>=20
> At least one author of accepted papers will be required to register for t=
he workshop before the paper is published in the ACM Digital Library, and t=
o present the paper at the workshop.
>=20
> Please note that attendance at the workshop also requires registration fo=
r the main ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS conference (http://sigspatial2014.sigspatial.=
org) in addition to registering for the workshop.
>=20
> Further details of the workshop can be found at
