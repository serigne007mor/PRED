DSAA Special Session on Environmental and geo-spatial data analytics 
(EnGeoData)

     IEEE 2015 International Conference on Data Science and Advanced 
Analytics

   				http://dsaa2015.lip6.fr/

				       Call for papers

			    Paris, France, 19-21 October, 2015


IEEE DSAA'2015 is an IEEE fully sponsored conference. DSAA'2015 aims to 
be a flagship data science and analytics conference in its kdn, and 
provide a premier forum that brings together researchers, industry 
practitioners, as well as potential users of big data, for discussion 
and exchange of ideas on the latest theoretical developments in Data 
Science as well as on the best practices for a wide range of 
applications.

DSAA is also technically sponsored by ACM through SIGKDD. DSAA is the 
only IEEE/ACM jointly sponsored conference truly in data science, big 
data and advanced analytics. DSAA'2014 was a fabulous event held in 2014 
in Shanghai, receiving the acceptance rate at 10.4% for regular 
presentations, and over 200 participants from 41 countries. It consisted 
of 11 main conference sessions, 7 special sessions, 5 keynote speeches, 
4 trends and controversies invited talks, a panel, plus 2 tutorials for 
you to enjoy a very busy 3-day data science gathering. We are pleased to 
let you know that the DSAA'2014 proceeding has been included into IEEE
