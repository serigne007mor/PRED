Workshop on Optimizing understanding in multilingual hospital encounters

October 20th, 2013 - University of Paris 13, Paris (F)

http://flores.lipn.univ-paris13.fr/tia2013/Workshops_hospital.html

In conjunction with the International Conference on Terminology and Artific=
ial
Intelligence TIA 2013
*****************************************************
dead-line for paper submission: September 10th, 2013
*****************************************************

In this workshop we will bring together participants who have solutions=20
for one or more of the following problems: How can mutual understanding=20
be optimized with the help of technology in hospitals where both=20
patients and professionals have varying language skills, cultural=20
backgrounds and cognitive capacities? Can domain ontologies, natural=20
language processing tools, multilingual knowledge-based tools,=20
multilingual terminology resources and other semantic technologies be=20
combined in order to enhance the quality of mutual understanding between=20
humans?

Multi-language web apps already exist that make it easier for different=20
health professionals to improve communication through the use of=20
terminology and phrases like standard questions and explanations in=20
multiple languages. We solicit ideas on how technology can optimize the=20
usability of this type of resource and of other types of resources and=20
on how new technologies can reuse all types of existing terminological=20
resources.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from several=20
domains, and practitioners from industry, academia and health policy=20
making bodies to report on recent developments, achievements, technology=20
trends and research results on projects concerning the optimization of=20
understanding in multilingual hospital encounters and the possibilities=20
of applying web-based technologies to this end.


What follows is a non-exhaustive list of topics of interest for this=20
workshop.

=E2=80=A2One of the topics is how cloud-based technology can optimize=20
understanding in caretaker - caregiver communication in a variety of=20
hospital settings where misunderstanding might be lurking because of=20
incompatible language skills, cultural differences, terminology, etc. We=20
welcome contributions in the field of current semantic web-based=20
technologies, techniques and tools with the aim of reusing distributed=20
data on the web and exploring web- based health applications.
=E2=80=A2We also solicit examples of service-oriented collective intelligen=
ce=20
and language resource interoperability. How can existing hospital=20
infrastructures of several kinds be designed for caregivers and for=20
caretakers as end users?
=E2=80=A2A clinical pathway is a decision-tree based on clinical assessment=
 that=20
guides the triage, history taking and further examination of a patient=20
with a particular clinical problem. We solicit examples of clinical=20
pathways for identifying and treating specific disorders at triage and=20
history taking in hospital emergency wards where caretakers and patients=20
do not speak the same language, in which the linguistic and cultural=20
background of a patient are taken into consideration.
=E2=80=A2General-purpose machine translation tools are not reliable for the=
=20
translation of medical records. We solicit examples of the use of=20
machine translation tools (trained to target specific domains in=20
medicine?) to enhance understanding between caregivers and caretakers in=20
well-defined contexts.

We invite you to send a short paper (4 pages, presentation time 15 minutes)
