Subject: [liste-egc] ADBIS 2023


As you may know, ADBIS 2023 will be held in Barcelona. We would like you 
to consider submitting a paper either to ADBIS or any of the satellite 
events. Please, find more information below and do not hesitate to ask 
me if you have any doubt.


ADBIS 2023
September 4-7, 2023, Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain
https://www.essi.upc.edu/dtim/ADBIS2023/index.html

Submissions DL: April 19 (abstract), April 23(paper), 2023

Special Issue: Information Systems (Elsevier) and Information Systems 
Frontiers (Springer)

Awards: Best Conference Paper and the Best Doctoral Consortium Paper

New in the ADBIS series: new paper types and a shepherding phase for 
borderline papers

LONG papers (14 LNCS pages) can be:
(a) regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings 
within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found 
in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, 
data structures, and system architectures for the management of data;
(b) experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published 
research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms 
and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, 
with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation 
findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the 
algorithm/system/method being assessed.

SHORT papers (10 LNCS pages) can be:
(a) early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and 
discussion of early research results, that include early experimental 
findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of 
the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the 
difficulties being faced towards full fruition;
(b) vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the 
exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for 
data management in important areas related to the scope of the 
conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of 
the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant.

ADBIS 2023 continues to participate in the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) 
initiative of the Database community aiming to guide researchers in our 
community to adopt a more inclusive mindset in general toward different 
individuals regardless of their age, gender, gender identity, race, 
cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual 
orientation, parental and marital status, etc.
With these aim, at least two registration-waiving bursaries for 
academics are reserved to promote diversity (priority given for 
first-authored student papers)

ADBIS 2023 also holds several relevant satellite events. Check them out!

- 9 proposed workshops on a diverse range of hot topics:
