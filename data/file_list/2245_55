<div>TUTORIAL PROPOSALS<br/>
The ECML PKDD 2020 Organizing Committee invites proposals for half-day tut=
orials to be held on the first and last days of the conference (September 1=
4th and 18th, 2020), which will take place in Ghent, Belgium=2E Tutorials a=
re intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to established or emerg=
ing research topics of interest to the machine learning and data mining com=
munity=2E These topics include related research fields or applications but =
also well-developed tools and suites that support ML/DM research=2E The ide=
al tutorial should attract a wide audience=2E It should be broad enough to =
provide a basic introduction to the chosen area, but it should also cover t=
he most important topics in depth=2E Each tutorial should be well-focused s=
o that its content can be covered in a half-day slot=2E For relatively nove=
l but rapidly maturing topics, we encourage a format that combines a half d=
ay tutorial (4h incl=2E one 30 minute break) followed by a half day worksho=
p (also 4h incl=2E one 30 minute break)=2E Proposals that exclusively focus=
 on the presenter&rsquo;s own work or commercial demonstrations are strongl=
y discouraged=2E We offer a waived registration fee for attendance of the m=
ain conference to one speaker for each accepted tutorial=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSALS<br/>
Tutorial proposals should contain at least the following:</div>

<div>A title and abstract of the tutorial=2E<br/>
A brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the ECML-=
PKDD community (no more than 2 pages)=2E<br/>
A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial&rsquo;=
s core content can be covered in a 4 hours slot (including a 30 minutes bre=
ak)=2E<br/>
The names and contact information of the tutorial instructors, including o=
ne-paragraph statements of their research interests and areas of expertise;=
 it is required to indicate in the proposal who is planning to attend the c=
onference and who will present which part=2E<br/>
A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same or a=
 similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of the au=
dience size=2E<br/>
A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e=2Eg=2E, a=
udio equipment)=2E<br/>
An indication on whether the tutorial is part of a combined tutorial+works=
hop proposal=2E In that case, we kindly ask you to write a single proposal =
for the tutorial and workshop, following the guidelines and attending to th=
e requirements for tutorials and workshops=2E For workshop guidelines, plea=
se see the separate Call For Workshop Proposals=2E<br/>
Tutorial slides will be made available online at the ECML-PKDD website, al=
though authors can provide them on additional websites as well=2E<br/>
Please submit your proposal to the workshop and tutorial chairs (Myra Spil=
iopoulou and Willem Waegeman) via wt_chairs@ecmlpkdd2020=2Enet=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>EVALUATION OF TUTORIAL PROPOSALS<br/>
Tutorial proposals will be reviewed by the workshop and tutorial co-chairs=
, who may use the help of external reviewers and experts on the submission =
topics=2E Features that will be evaluated are:</div>

<div>The interestingness for the ECML PKDD areas, which should result in a=
 large audience=2E<br/>
The clarity of the tutorial, which should emerge from its description=2E<b=
r/>
Good organization as appearing from the outline=2E<br/>
The scientific renown and experience of the tutorialists in the topic area=
 of the proposed tutorial<br/>
The ability to explain the topics to a large audience with heterogeneous b=
ackground=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>WORKSHOP PROPOSALS<br/>
The ECML PKDD 2020 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops to=
 be held on the first and last days of the conference (September 14th and 1=
8th, 2020), which will take place in Ghent, Belgium=2E We solicit proposals=
 for both full- and half-day workshops in current and emerging topics in ma=
chine learning and data mining=2E Workshops provide an opportunity to discu=
ss novel topics in a small and interactive atmosphere=2E They can concentra=
te in-depth on research topics, but can also be devoted to application doma=
ins or issues, or to questions concerning the economic and social aspects o=
f machine learning and data mining=2E Multidisciplinary workshops that brin=
g together researchers and practitioners from different communities are par=
ticularly welcome=2E We offer a waived registration fee for attendance of t=
he main conference to one organizer or invited speaker for each accepted wo=
rkshop=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>DURATION &amp; FORMAT<br/>
We welcome full- and half-day workshop proposals, as well as tutorial+work=
shop proposals=2E Full-day workshops have a program of typically 8 hours in=
cluding two 30-minute coffee breaks plus a lunch break=2E Half-day workshop=
s have a 4 hours program with a 30-minute coffee break=2E Combined tutorial=
+workshop events start with a half-day tutorial followed by a half-day work=
shop=2E We would like to encourage proposers to aim for a program that is b=
oth varied and interesting=2E Especially where the format of the workshop i=
s concerned, we would like you to think about ways of going beyond the usua=
l list of presentations of accepted papers=2E Keep in mind that the main co=
nference is necessarily more time-constrained and workshops therefore allow=
 for group explorations of interesting topics, for example by means of disc=
ussions, demo sessions, invited talks, and panels=2E Another way of extendi=
ng the usual format is to include a specific challenge problem that can be =
addressed by the workshop participants, with a dedicated challenge session =
in the workshop program=2E Note, however, that the challenge should be only=
 one of the components of the workshop, targeting a problem which is specif=
ic to the workshop topic(s)=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSALS<br/>
Workshop proposals should contain the necessary information for the worksh=
op chairs and reviewers to judge the importance, quality, and community int=

a program=2E When proposing a workshop, please provide (at least) the follo=
wing information:</div>

<div>A brief description of the specific issues that the workshop will add=
ress, the reasons why the workshop is of interest, the main research areas =
involved, and what the workshop will add to the conference (e=2Eg=2E, do yo=
u expect papers of a theme that would not fit the main conference?)=2E<br/>

elevant recently published or submitted contributions, etc=2E) and expected=
 format of the workshop (e=2Eg=2E, invited talks, presentations, poster ses=
sions, panel discussions, challenge sessions, or other ideas for ensuring a=
n interactive atmosphere)=2E In the case of a combined tutorial-workshop, p=
lease clearly indicate the format=2E<br/>
Any special requirements regarding logistics (e=2Eg=2E, poster stands, aud=
io equipment), if applicable=2E<br/>
An estimate of the number of expected submissions, and an estimate of the =
number of expected workshop participants at the conference=2E Proof of inte=
rest from the community will be of added value to the proposal=2E<br/>
If you are making a proposal for a tutorial+workshop event, we kindly ask =
you to write a single proposal that covers both=2E In addition, the links s=
hould be clearly described and the proposal should be submitted to the work=

ubmit to the workshop every year<br/>
Experience of the proposers in organizing such an event and contacts withi=

Involvement of renowned members of this community as anticipated authors o=
