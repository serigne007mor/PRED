Subject: [liste-egc] CfP BIR@ECIR2020 - 10th international workshop on
 Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval

You are invited to submit to the 10th international workshop on =
Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR 2020), to be held as =
part of the 42nd European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR =
2020).=20

<https://sites.google.com/view/bir-ws/bir-2020>=20

=3D=3D=3D Important Dates =3D=3D=3D
- Submissions: 27 January 2020
- Notifications: 28 February 2020
- Camera Ready Contributions: 30 March 2020
- Workshop: 14 April 2020 in Lisbon, Portugal


=3D=3D=3D tl;dr =3D=3D=3D
The Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshop series at =
ECIR tackles issues related to academic search, at the crossroads =
between Information Retrieval and Bibliometrics.  BIR is a hot topic =
investigated by both academia (e.g., ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX) and the =
industry (e.g., Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Semantic =
Scholar). A one-day workshop is to be held at ECIR 2020 in Lisbon, =
Portugal.
Past BIR(NDL) proceedings are online https://dblp.org/search?q=3DBIR.ECIR =
as open access.


=3D=3D=3D Keywords =3D=3D=3D
Academic Search =E2=80=A2 Information Retrieval =E2=80=A2 Digital =
Libraries =E2=80=A2 Bibliometrics =E2=80=A2 Scientometrics


=3D=3D=3D Workshop Topics =3D=3D=3D
We welcome (but are not limited to) submissions regarding all three =
aspects of academic search below:

 - Information seeking & searching with scientific information, such as:
     . Finding relevant papers/authors for a literature review.
     . Measuring the degree of plagiarism in a paper.
     . Identifying expert reviewers for a given submission.
     . Flagging predatory conferences and journals.
     . Information seeking behaviour and human-computer interaction in =
academic search.

 - Mining the scientific literature, such as:
     . Information extraction, text mining and parsing of scholarly =
literature.
     . Natural language processing (e.g., citation contexts).
     . Discourse modelling and argument mining.

 - Academic search/recommender systems, such as:
     . Modelling the multifaceted nature of scientific information.
     . Building test collections for reproducible BIR.
     . System support for literature search and recommendation.

We especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work =
as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple =
themes directly are especially welcome.


=3D=3D=3D Aim of the Workshop =3D=3D=3D
Searching for scientific information is a long-lived information need.  =
In the early 1960s, Salton (1963) was already striving to enhance =
information retrieval by including clues inferred from bibliographic =
citations.  The development of citation indexes pioneered by Garfield =
(1955) proved determinant for such a research endeavour at the =
crossroads between the nascent fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and =
Bibliometrics [Bibliometrics refers to the statistical analysis of the =
academic literature (Pritchard, 1969) and plays a key role in =
scientometrics: the quantitative analysis of science and innovation =
(Leydesdorff & Milojevic, 2015)].  The pioneers who established these =
fields in Information Science---such as Salton and Garfield---were =
followed by scientists who specialised in one of these (White & McCain, =
1998), leading to the two loosely connected fields we know of today.

The purpose of the BIR workshop series founded in 2014 is to tighten up =
the link between IR and Bibliometrics.  We strive to get the =
=E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=80=99 =
(White & McCain, 1998) active in both academia and the industry =
together, who are developing search engines and recommender systems such =
as ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, and =
Semantic Scholar, just to name a few.

These bibliometric-enhanced IR systems must deal with the multifaceted =
nature of scientific information by searching for or recommending =
academic papers, patents, venues (i.e., conferences or journals), =
authors, experts (e.g., peer reviewers), references (to be cited to =
support an argument), and datasets.  The underlying models harness =
relevance signals from keywords provided by authors, topics extracted =
from the full-texts, coauthorship networks, citation networks, and =
various classifications schemes of science.
Bibliometric-enhanced IR is a hot topic whose recent developments made =
the news---see for instance the Initiative for Open Citations (Shotton, =
2018) and the Google Dataset Search (Castelvecchi, 2018) launched on =
September 4, 2018.  We believe that BIR@ECIR is a much needed scientific =
event for the =E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=
=80=99 to meet and join forces pushing the knowledge boundaries of IR =
applied to literature search and recommendation.
