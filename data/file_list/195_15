First Announcement and Call for Papers
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN ACTION (KMIA-2008)
Held in conjunction with the 20th
IFIP World Computer Congress
September 7-10, 2008, Milano, IT
Organized by IFIP Working Group 12.6, Knowledge Management
http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~debenham/tc12/tc12.html 
<http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/%7Edebenham/tc12/tc12.html>
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
Scope and Topics
----------------
Organizations of different kinds, from structured companies up to social 
networks or virtual communities, are becoming increasingly aware of the 
need to collect, organize, mobilize, increase, in sum manage, the 
knowledge characterizing their ability to stay alive, adapt and evolve 
in a turbulent context. Knowledge Management (KM) is a keyword under 
which different organizational and technological approaches to answer 
this need are referred to, both in applied research and in the practices 
of real organizations. KMIA aims to collect papers reporting on 
experiences that are confronted with real situations and highlight 
problems, requirements and solutions that are derived from those 
experiences by taking into account the following perspectives:
• organizational strategies to enact and promote KM within 
organizations, and their relation with the ICT technology
• various kinds of knowledge, application domains, organizational 
structures, and their implication on KM
• methods and approaches for the design of KM solutions
• techniques and technologies for a sustainable KM (CSCW-based 
approaches, web-based approaches, etc.)
• critical success factors for KM socio-technical solutions
• evaluation of KM applications in real situations
• lessons-learned in each phase of the KM application life-cycle, from 
conception up to continuous adaptation
• critical comparison of technologies, field studies and strategies in KM
• any other perspective contributing to a better understanding of KM in 
action
