                          Call for Papers

    3rd International ICST Conference on Electronic Healthcare
                       for the 21st century

             13-15 December 2010 - Casablanca, Morocco

                 http://www.electronic-health.org/

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conference Aims:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Building on the very successful 2nd edition of the eHealth conference
series held in Istanbul in September 2009, the aim of eHealth 2010 is
to bring together experts from academia, industry and global
healthcare institutions such as WHO and ECDC to stimulate
cutting-edge research discussions, share experience with real-world
healthcare service providers and policy makers as well as provide
numerous business opportunities.

Swine flu epidemics in 2009 demonstrated a breakthrough in the use of
web intelligence harnessing and mining user-generated content in
social networks and Web 2.0 tools for rapid healthcare information
dissemination and outbreak detection. In addition, despite
substantial budgets spent on eHealth in recent years, existing
healthcare services do not sufficiently address the issue of patient
privacy, trust nor the potential in e-learning and web mining for
delivering 21st-century healthcare systems for European citizens. The
key topic of eHealth 2010 will be investigating a realistic potential
of Web 2.0 and Web Intelligence in providing evidence-based
healthcare information, assist in outbreak detection and control and
provide quality-assured and effective interventions for patients and
global users.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conference Topics:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*       Web Intelligence - Web 2.0 and social networks, techniques
for harnessing  and mining user-generated content, provision of
pertinent information to patients, outbreak detection and early
warning systems, data collection and analysis for surveillance and
epidemiology.


*       Privacy, trust and security - electronic patient records,
models for trust and privacy, novel mobile encryption technologies,
identity federation, role based access control, privacy enhancing
technologies


*       Healthcare ontologies and knowledge management systems -
annotation, health care ontologies, coding standards, communication
standards, quality tagging and quality of service, distribution
issues, coding systems and ontology mapping, search, user
customisation, alert agents


*       E-learning, educational games and the impact of information
delivery to patients and professionals - using digital libraries in
building online communities, moderated discussion groups,
qualitative and quantitative evaluation studies, user attitudes
towards the knowledge, studies of changes of user attitude with
respect to digital libraries


*       Web 2.0 in healthcare, wellbeing and online communities of
practice - community of practice, Web 2.0, user support groups,
blogs, personalisation and profiling, online support for healthy
lifestyle, wellbeing and public interventions


*       Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks -
performance evaluation methodologies, virtualized models for evidence
based medicine, patient/process flow models, sensor technologies
and RFID tagging, mobile healthcare technologies, asset management
systems, application to evidence based medicine, industrial
practice and experience


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Workshop: Personalisation for eHealth
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Electronic Health 2010 will be collocated with the 4th International
Workshop on Personalisation for eHealth (Pers4eHealth2010).

*       The past years have witnessed unprecedented levels of
investment in the eHealth sector, both in terms of research effort,
and in terms of funding, as well as a great public interest. EHealth
can be broadly defined as the application of IT (especially internet
technologies) to improve the access, efficiency, effectiveness
and quality of any processes (clinical and business alike) related to
health care. In the eHealth vision, intelligent systems would, for
example, enable: (i) citizens to take more control of their
well-being, by accessing personalised and qualified health
information, both medical and pedagogical, and accessing appropriate
medical care from their homes; (ii) health professionals to manage
their activity more efficiently, by receiving relevant and timely
updates; and (iii) teams of health professionals to work together
more effectively, coordinating their activities, sharing their
knowledge about the patients they are collectively taking care of,
and ensuring the best coordinated care is provided. The workshop will
focus on the many aspects of personalisation for health delivery,
related to eHealth environments.
