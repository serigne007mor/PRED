                             Call for Papers:
             Workshop on Dynamic Networks and Knowledge Discovery
                               (DyNaK 2010)
    co-located with ECML PKDD 2010, September 24, 2010, Barcelona, Spain
                     http://kdd.di.unito.it/DyNaK2010/
=============================================================================== 


Aim and Scope
-------------

Modeling and analyzing networks is a major emerging topic in
different research areas, such as computational biology, social
science, document retrieval, etc. By connecting objects, it is
possible to obtain an intuitive and global view of the
relationships between components of a complex system.

Nowadays, the scientific communities have access to huge volumes
of network- structured data, such as social networks,
gene/proteins/metabolic networks, sensor networks, peer-to-peer
networks. Most often, these data are not only static, but they
are collected at different time points. This dynamic view of the
system allows the time component to play a key role in the
comprehension of the evolutionary behavior of the
network (evolution of the network structure and/or of flows
within the system). Time can help to determine the real causal
relationships within, for instance, gene activations, link
creation, information flow.

Handling such data is a major challenge for current research in
machine learning and data mining, and it has led to the
development of recent innovative techniques that consider
complex/multi-level networks, time-evolving graphs, heterogeneous
information (nodes and links), and requires scalable algorithms
that are able to manage huge and complex networks.

DyNaK workshop is motivated by the interest of providing a
meeting point for scientists with different backgrounds that are
interested in the study of large complex networks and the dynamic
aspects of such networks. It aims at attracting contributions
from both aspects of networks analysis: large real network
analysis and modelling, and knowledge discovery within those
networks. Even though each type of real complex networks has some
peculiarities related to its specific domain, many aspects of the
modeling and mining techniques for such networks are
shareable. For instance, gene networks and social networks share
a common architecture (scale-free), and involve similar data
mining and machine learning methods: module/community extraction,
hub single-out, information-flow analysis, missing link detection
and link prediction.

Special session on Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining
--------------------------------------------------------

Every day, millions of people write their opinions about any
issue in social media, such as social news sites, review sites,
and blogs. The distillation of knowledge from this huge amount of
unstructured information is a challenging task. Sentiment
Analysis and Opinion Mining are two areas related to Natural
Language Processing and Text Mining that deal with the
identification of opinions and attitudes in natural language
texts. In the Opinion Mining session of DyNaK we are interested
in research results from academics and practitionersin the task
of extracting knowledge from user generated contents, and how
time affects this analysis.
