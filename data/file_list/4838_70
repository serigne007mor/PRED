**Apologies for cross-postings**

Applications are invited for a 12-month-postdoctoral fellowship in =
Computer Science. The research will be conducted in the DM2L team of the =
LIRIS lab (CNRS UMR 5205) at INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France. The =
position is funded by IDEX Lyon IMPULSION.

Project information

Context

With the emergence of artificial intelligence, the extraction of =
geographic information has become a key element in knowledge extraction =
and information retrieval. It involves multiple fields especially =
related to digital humanities, such as information processing, knowledge =
management, automatic data analysis and decision making. It is =
increasingly attracting the attention of many researchers to go beyond =
the possibilities offered by traditional geographic information systems =
to manipulate named places in addition to geographical coordinates. In a =
context of management and analysis of big data, the existing methods =
appear too segmented and too specific to the type of documents =
considered. The generalization of a method for the treatment of =
heterogeneous data then appears as a major scientific issue.

One of the objectives of this project is to strengthen interdisciplinary =
collaborations and federate research in engineering (computer science =
and data science) and Humanities and Social Sciences (geography, =
history, linguistics, etc.) around digital issues. The challenge is at =
the same time to solve scientific issues in engineering and to address =
societal issues around the treatment of geographic information (smart =
city, heritage enhancement, territory development, etc.).

The post-doctoral candidate will integrate with the DM2L team of the =
LIRIS lab and their research objectives will be related to several =
ongoing projects (the CHOUCAS ANR project, the G=C3=A9oDisco MSH Lyon =
St-Etienne project, and the Spatial History of the Encyclop=C3=A9die =
project). The candidate will also have the opportunity to participate in =
multidisciplinary international collaborations (with computer =
scientists, geographers, historians, and linguists).

Research objective

In this project, we propose to design and develop a hybrid and modular =
method of extracting geographic and semantic information from =
heterogeneous textual corpora (eg, historical, legal, literary, tourist =
documents, user reviews, social media, etc.). In this context there are =
several research challenges to be addressed. The first objective is the =
identification and automatic classification of documents in order to =
apply the most appropriate information extraction methods. Then the main =
objective concerns the combination and interoperability between symbolic =
and statistical NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods (symbolic =
rules, machine learning, and data mining). This combination of =
approaches should lead to better performance than conventional methods =
and better adaptability to the type of document. In particular, we want =
to develop and implement a hybrid method based on formal grammars and =
supervised learning techniques.

The overall objective of the project is to design a platform (which will =
be deployed as web services) to combine, enrich and evaluate the latest =
advances in the field of NLP, semantic modeling and knowledge =
extraction. The different methods implemented within the platform will =
be accessible to non-experts.

Practical information

Knowledge, Skills and Experience

- Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Artificial =
Intelligence/Machine Learning, or a related field.
- Strong publication record and/or proven ability to deliver =
high-quality software in a research context.
- Good communication skills (oral and written).
- French is a plus but not mandatory.

Remuneration terms and Conditions

- The starting date is flexible, between February and November 2019. The =
candidate should indicate the preferred starting date in the application =
letter.
- The position is for one year (12 months) with a salary after taxes of =
2,100 euros per month (gross monthly salary: 2,600 euros).

Application procedure

- Enquiries should be directed to Dr Ludovic Moncla =
(ludovic.moncla_AT_liris.cnrs.fr).
- Applications including a CV, a list of publications and an =
approximately two-page description of research interests should be sent =
by email to Ludovic Moncla: Applicants should also arrange two =
recommendation letters (to be sent to the same address).
- Applications will be welcome until the position is filled, those =
submitted before 15/02/2019 will be considered in priority.
