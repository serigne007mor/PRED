***************************************************************
2nd International Workshop on Cloud Intelligence (Cloud-I 2013)

In conjunction with VLDB 2013, Riva del Garda (Trento), Italy

CALL FOR PAPERS
***************

With the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud business intelligence=
 "as a service" offerings have sparkled widely, both from cloud start-ups a=
nd major BI industry vendors. Beyond porting BI features into the cloud, wh=
ich already implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL database modeling =
and storage, data localization, security and privacy, performance, cost and=
 usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges for making=
 data analytics available to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), non-=
governmental organizations, web communities (e.g., supported by social netw=
orks), and even the average citizen; this vision presumably requiring a mix=
ture of both private and open data.

The aim of the Cloud-I workshop is to become an interdisciplinary, regular =
exchange forum for researchers, industry and practitioners, as well as all =
potential users of Cloud Intelligence. The submission of research, industri=
al, position, visionary, survey and student papers are encouraged to fuel u=
p the discussion.

The 2nd International Workshop on Cloud Intelligence (Cloud-I 2013) will be=
 collocated with the 39th International Conference on Very Large Databases =
(VLDB 2013). Proceedings shall be published in ACM ICPS (to be confirmed). =
The best accepted papers will also be invited to submit extended versions t=
o a special issue of Information Systems.
