Subject: [liste-egc] International Workshop on Data Management in Ambient
 Environments           (DAMAE'11) in conjunction with the  22nd DEXA
 Conference


1st International Workshop on Data Management in Ambient Environments
(DAMAE'11)
in conjunction with the 22nd DEXA Conference

http://www.univ-valenciennes.fr/congres/DAMAE11/

In the last decade, a number of small-sized wireless devices (e.g.,
laptops, smartphones, sensors or RFIDs) with increasing computing
capabilities have appeared in the market at very affordable costs. These
"smart devices" have strongly impacted the services and applications
provided to users in numerous domains (transportation, health, commerce,
etc.). We are now entering the era of "ambient computing" and have to
provide services and make data available "anywhere at anytime". Due to the
inherent mobility and the constrained resources provided by these smart
devices, in terms of autonomy, network bandwidth or storage capacity,
traditional data management techniques are no more suited. Therefore,
these techniques are evolving and new solutions are appearing. They mainly
aim at improving data access, data privacy and context awareness while
considering smart devicesâ€™ specificities. Moreover, these techniques have
to integrate the wide heterogeneity of data producers. Some data sources
may indeed produce continuous data streams (e.g., sensors) whereas others
may give access to collections of data items. Given these new challenges,
researchers and practitioners from industry and academia should gather
together to discuss future trends in Data Management in Ambient
Environments.

The DAMAE workshop will provide a forum for fruitful discussions on
challenges and approaches about this emerging and challenging area.
Specific topics of the DAMAE workshop include, but are not limited to:

    * Context awareness & adaptation
    * Data dissemination protocols
    * Data streams
    * Query processing (location based queries, spatio-temporal queries,
nearest neighbor queries, etc.)
    * Methods, models and infrastructures for ambient environments
    * Privacy and security
    * Aggregation and information extraction
    * Data consistency and replication
    * Evaluation frameworks (prototypes, simulators, testbeds, etc.)
