Subject: [liste-egc] Call for ECML PKDD workshop submissions

<html><head></head><body><div style=3D"font-family: Verdana;font-size: 12=
=2E0px;"><div>
<div>The ECML PKDD 2019 Organizing Committee invites proposals for worksho=
ps to be held on the first and last days of the conference (September 16th =
and 20th, 2019), which will take place in W&uuml;rzburg, Germany=2E We invi=
te proposals for both full- and half-day workshops in current and emerging =
topics in machine learning and data mining=2E Workshops provide an opportun=
ity to discuss novel topics in a small and interactive atmosphere=2E They c=
an concentrate in-depth on research topics, but can also be devoted to appl=
ication domains or issues, or to questions concerning the economic and soci=
al aspects of machine learning and data mining=2E Multidisciplinary worksho=
ps that bring together researchers and practitioners from different communi=
ties are particularly welcome=2E One organizer or invited speaker of an acc=
epted workshop is offered the possibility of waived registration fee for at=
tendance of the main conference=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>DURATION &amp; FORMAT</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We welcome both full- and half-day workshop proposals=2E Full-day wor=
kshops will have a program of typically 8 hours including two 30-minute cof=
fee breaks plus a lunch break=2E Half-day workshops will have a 4 hours pro=
gram with a 30-minute coffee break=2E We would like to encourage proposers =
to aim for a program that is both varied and interesting=2E Especially wher=
e the format of the workshop is concerned, we would like you to think about=
 ways of going beyond the usual list of presentations of accepted papers=2E=
 Keep in mind that the main conference is necessarily more time-constrained=
 and workshops therefore allow for group explorations of interesting topics=
, for example by means of discussions, demo sessions, invited talks, and pa=
nels=2E Another way of extending the usual format is to include a specific =
challenge problem that can be addressed by the workshop participants, with =
a dedicated challenge session in the workshop program=2E Note, however, tha=
t the challenge should be only one of the components of the workshop, targe=
ting a problem which is specific to the workshop topic(s)=2E For some works=
hops, it may be useful to first present an introduction to the state-of-the=
-art in the field given by experienced invited presenters, and afterwards d=
iscuss more technical or novel work in a standard (or non-standard!) worksh=
op setting=2E COMBINED TUTORIAL &amp; WORKSHOP Especially for a relatively =
novel but rapidly maturing topic, giving the aforementioned introduction of=
 the state-of-the-art may go beyond the scope of an invited presentation=2E=
 In this case, a half day tutorial (4h incl=2E one 30 minute break) followe=
d by a half day workshop (4h incl=2E one 30 minute break) is a highly recom=
mended good format=2E We kindly ask you to write a single proposal for the =
tutorial and workshop that covers the different guidelines and requirements=
 for tutorials and workshops=2E In addition, the links should be clearly de=
scribed and the proposal should be submitted to the workshop and tutorial c=
hairs (select &lsquo;Workshop and Tutorial&rsquo; as topic on easychair)=2E=
 For tutorial guidelines, please see the separate Call For Tutorial Proposa=
ls=2E&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSALS&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Workshop proposals should contain the necessary information for the w=
orkshop chairs and reviewers to judge the importance, quality, and communit=
y interest in the proposed topic (a minimum of 15-20 expected participants =
is required)=2E Each workshop should have one or more designated organisers=
 and a program=2E When proposing a workshop, please provide (at least) the =
following information:</div>

<div>A brief description of the specific issues that the workshop will add=
ress, the reasons why the workshop is of interest, the main research areas =
involved, and what the workshop will add to the conference (e=2Eg=2E, do yo=
u expect papers of a theme that would not fit the main conference?)=2E<br/>
Contact information of the workshop chairs, their competence in the propos=
ed topic(s), and previous experience in chairing scientific events=2E<br/>
A tentative list of Program Committee members and potential invited speake=
rs=2E<br/>
A draft of the Call for Papers, including information on accepted formats =
(e=2Eg=2E, regular papers, extended abstracts, oral-only presentations of r=
elevant recently published or submitted contributions, etc=2E) and expected=
 format of the workshop (e=2Eg=2E, invited talks, presentations, poster ses=
sions, panel discussions, challenge sessions, or other ideas for ensuring a=
n interactive atmosphere)=2E In the case of a combined tutorial-workshop, p=
lease clearly indicate the format=2E<br/>
Any special requirements regarding logistics (e=2Eg=2E, poster stands, aud=
io equipment), if applicable=2E<br/>
An estimate of the number of expected submissions, and an estimate of the =
number of expected workshop participants at the conference=2E Proof of inte=
rest from the community will be of added value to the proposal=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>SUBMISSION</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Please submit your proposals through EasyChair (https://easychair=2Eo=
rg/conferences/?conf=3Dwtecmlpkdd2019)=2E The submitted proposals will be r=
eviewed in a close collaboration with the conference chairs and the program=

h they consider their paper to be relevant=2E These papers, together with t=
heir reviews, will be sent to the workshop chairs if the paper gets rejecte=
d for a second evaluation=2E This should increase the submissions made to t=
he workshop while at the same time reducing the workload of the workshop re=
viewing committee=2E This does mean that the reviewing period for the works=
hops partially overlaps with the main conferences reviewing, so we advise y=
ou to build your programme committee early=2E For paper submission, reviewi=
