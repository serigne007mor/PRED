Third International Conference on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems
 
September 1-2, 2010, Bilbao, Spain

Conference URL:	http://www.dexa.org or http://www.irit.fr/globe10

Publication:

1. Proceedings

All accepted conference papers will be published in: LNCS - Lecture Notes 
in Computer Science - Springer Verlag (http://www.springer.com/lncs).

2. Distinguished Papers

Extended versions of selected papers will be published in a Special Issue
of the International Journal "Transactions on Large- Scale Data- and  Knowledge- Centerd Systems", LNCS Springer Verlag. 
www.springer.com/lncs/tldks or http://www.springer.com/series/8637

Scope:

Research topics such as Grid and Peer-to-Peer computing are relatively recent. They are important for scale distributed systems and applications that require effective management of voluminous, distributed, and heterogeneous data. This importance comes out of characteristics offered by these systems: the autonomy and the dynamicity of peers, the decentralization of control, and the effective and transparent sharing of
large-scale distributed resources. Today, Grid and P2P systems open towards the management of large,
distributed, and heterogeneous data which raises new problems and presents new challenges.

The main objective of this international conference on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems is to present the latest results in research and applications, to identify new issues, and to shape future directions.

Topics

Original papers preferably but not limited to the following topics 
are welcome (all the topics are related to Grid ans P2P systems):

    * Data Storage and Management
    * Data Integration and Metadata Management
