CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on the Theory on Belief Functions

Brest, France, April 1-2, 2010

http://www.ensieta.fr/belief2010

Honorary chairs and invited speakers :
Arthur P. Dempster and Glenn Shafer

==================================================

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or 
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in 
the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn 
Shafer as a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty. These 
early contributions have been the starting points of many important 
developments, including the Transferable Belief Model and the Theory of 
Hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a 
general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well 
understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, 
possibility and imprecise probability theories.

This workshop is dedicated to the confrontation of ideas, the reporting 
of recent achievements and the presentation of the wide range of 
applications of this theory.

AUDIENCE AND TOPICS OF INTEREST
This workshop will give opportunities to exchange information and ideas 
on various aspects of the theory of belief functions. The intended 
audience for this workshop includes researchers and practitioners 
develop and use the theory of belief functions. Original contributions 
are therefore solicited on theoretical aspects (including decision 
making, combination rules, continuous belief functions, independence and 
graphical models, statistical estimation, etc), as well as on 
applications in various areas including, but not limited to data fusion, 
pattern recognition, clustering, tracking, data mining, signal and image 
processing, medical diagnosis, business decision, etc.

PUBLICATION
Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication 
in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 
(Elsevier).

PAPER SUBMISSION
Paper submissions are due by 1 December 2009 and should be no more than 
6 pages in length. Paper submission instructions are available at 
www.ensieta.fr/belief2010. All submitted papers will be reviewed by at 
least two reviewers.
Thanks to the EGC association, the inscriptions of students for the 
first submissions of student paper, if accepted, will be free.
