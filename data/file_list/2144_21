Subject: [liste-egc] First Call for papers: Special issue on Ontology
 Matching and  Machine Learning (Semantic Web Journal)

Special issue on Ontology Matching and Machine Learning
https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/special-issue-ontology-matchi=
ng-and-machine-learning

-------------------
This special issue aims to discuss the latest research proposals and on=
 the use of machine learning for ontology matching, data interlinking, =
and data integration in general.

Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler for the Semantic We=
b, as well as a useful technique in some classical data integration tas=
ks dealing with the semantic heterogeneity problem. It takes ontologies=
 as input and determines as output an alignment, that is, a set of corr=
espondences between the semantically related entities of those ontologi=
es. These correspondences can be used for various tasks, such as ontolo=
gy merging, data interlinking, query answering or navigation over knowl=
edge graphs. Thus, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data e=
xpressed with the matched ontologies to interoperate.

While early approaches have addressed the use of machine learning, new =
deep learning and large language models have gained attention in the fi=
eld, proving new ways of capturing the relationships between the entiti=
es of different ontologies.

The special issue aims at providing a comprehensive view of the latest =
research advancements and inspire further research in this evolving are=
a. We welcome original research papers that propose novel techniques, m=
odels, and frameworks for ontology matching, data interlink and data in=
tegration.

-------------------
Themes and Topics
-------------------
We are interested in (including but not limited to) the following theme=
s and topics that study the application of deep learning and large lang=
age models in general:

- Matching and deep learning
- Matching and large language models
- Learning in instance matching, data interlinking
- Large-scale and efficient matching techniques
- Matching and neuro-symbolic techniques
- Matcher selection, combination and tuning
- User involvement
- Explanations in matching
- Social and collaborative matching
- Uncertainty in matching
- Expressive alignments
- Reasoning with alignments
- Alignment coherence and debugging
- Matching for emerging applications (e.g., web tables, knowledge graph=
s)
- Benchmarks for machine learning oriented matching

-------------------
Deadline
-------------------
Submission deadline: 20th February 2024. Papers submitted before the de=
adline will be reviewed upon receipt.

-------------------
Author Guidelines
-------------------

We invite full papers, dataset descriptions, application reports and re=
ports on tools and systems. Submissions must be original and should not=
 have been published previously or be under consideration for publicati=
on while being evaluated for this special issue. Authors can extend pre=
viously published conference or workshop papers; guidelines for this ca=
n be found in FAQ 9.=20

Submissions shall be made through the Semantic Web journal website at h=
ttp://www.semantic-web-journal.net. Prospective authors must take notic=
e of the submission guidelines posted at http://www.semantic-web-journa=
l.net/authors.

We welcome any submission type as described http://www.semantic-web-jou=
rnal.net/authors#types.

While there is no upper limit, paper length must be justified by conten=
t. Note that you need to request an account on the website for submitti=
ng a paper. Please indicate in the cover letter that it is for the "Ont=
ology Matching and Machine Learning" special issue.

All manuscripts will be reviewed based on the SWJ open and transparent =
review policy and will be made available online during the review proce=
ss.

Also note that the Semantic Web journal is open access and all submissi=
ons rely on an open and transparent review process (see FAQ 1). Finally=
 please note that submissions must comply with the journal=E2=80=99s Op=
en Science Data requirements, which are detailed in the corresponding b=
log post.
