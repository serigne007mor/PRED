CALL FOR PAPERS *[Deadline Extended]*


Workshop on Management of Data under Uncertainty (MoDU 2023)
To be held in conjunction with ADBIS 2023 
(https://www.essi.upc.edu/dtim/ADBIS2023/)
September 4, 2023
Barcelona, Spain
https://modu2023.lis-lab.fr/

*************************************************************************

** GENERAL INFORMATION **
In the era of big data and Machine learning, the issue of uncertainty, 
is still an active research topic. Uncertainty needs to be managed at 
various levels of data management process: data collection, data 
querying, machine learning and data analytics. For instance, the 
presence of uncertainty can be source of semantics errors during query 
evaluation. Moreover, traditional machine learning and deep learning 
models do not consider uncertainty in data and predictions while they 
are prone to noises. Then, quantifying uncertainty is a critical 
challenge for most machine learning techniques. From analytics 
perspective, the presence of uncertainty and imprecision can cause 
inaccuracies in predictions that may impact the quality of the data 
analytics procedures themselves.


** GOAL OF THE WORKSHOP **
The aim of the workshop is to allow academics and industrial from 
various areas to share their experiences on management of uncertain 
data. Authors are encouraged to submit their research work and case 
studies addressing all facets of uncertainty and showing the usefulness 
of their approaches in different application domains.


** LIST OF TOPICS **
We seek contributions covering all aspects of data management under 
uncertainty, including, but not limited to, the following topics:

Uncertainty in data collection and querying:
• Incompleteness, ambiguity, inconsistency in data
• Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
• Uncertainty Modeling
• Querying uncertain data
• Approximate query
• Uncertain data fusion

Uncertainty in ML and Deep learning models:
• Prediction models for uncertain data
• Uncertainty quantification in deep and machine learning
• Uncertainty in data labeling
• Reasoning under uncertainty
• Uncertain data and conformal approaches

Uncertainty in data analytics:
• Uncertainty and Imprecision in (big) data management and Analytics
• Uncertain Spatial Data Management
• Data mining on uncertain data
• Metrics for uncertainty and data quality
• Uncertainty quantification

** SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS **
Submissions should present original works not currently under review or 
published elsewhere. This workshop accepts research and industrial 
papers (regular: 12 pages max., and short: 6-8 pages max.) including 
novel approaches for management of uncertain data. All accepted papers 
will be published in the conference proceedings and will be submitted 
for inclusion. Papers should submitted in PDF format using the EasyChair 
online submission system 
(https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=modu2023). Authors should 
consult Springer's authors' guidelines and use their proceedings 
templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their 
papers.

** IMPORTANT DATES **
• Paper submission (Extended): May 8, 2023
• Notification of paper acceptance: May 15, 2023
• Camera-ready due: June 9, 2023
• Workshop day: September 4, 2023

** WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS **
• Richard Chbeir, University Pau & Pays Adour, Anglet, France
• Allel Hadjali, Engineer School ENSMA, Poitiers, France
• Sana Sellami, Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France

** PUBLICATION **
The workshop papers will be published by Springer in Communications in 
Computer and Information Science (CCIS). The authors of selected 
workshop papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their 
contributions to a special issue of a well-established and ranked 
international journal (tbd).

** DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION STATEMENT **
We kindly ask authors to adopt inclusive language in their papers and 
presentations. Our aim is to promote DEI in MoDU by implementing 
different actions such as having diverse PC members, co-chairs and 
session chairpersons.
