The 1st International Workshop on Advanced Techniques for Web Services

Scope and Topics
Web services (WSs) are nowadays emerging as a major technology for 
deploying automated interactions between distributed and heterogeneous 
applications. Various standards back this deployment including WSDL (Web 
Services Definition Language), UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, 
and Integration), and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). These 
standards respectively support the definition of WSs, their 
advertisement to the community of potential users, and finally their 
binding for invocation purposes.

Despite the tremendous potential of WSs to address complex problems, 
they still lack some capabilities that would propel them a higher level 
of acceptance and make them compete with traditional integration 
middleware like CORBA and DCOM. For instance, WSs adoption continues to 
be slowed down due to various recurrent issues such as the complexity of 
WSs discovery. To address these issues, solutions could be built upon 
different advanced techniques like recommender systems, case-based 
reasoning, fuzzy logic, business process mining, complex data matching, 
etc.

By organizing this workshop, we aim at shedding the light on the latest 
techniques that could be coupled to Web services. Topics of interests 
include, but are not limited to:

* Recommendation systems and Web services;
* Web services discovery and composition using recommendation;
* Semantic matching for Web services during recommendation;
* Semantic Web paradigm for WS description, discovery, and composition;
* Coordination techniques for WS transactions, agreement, etc.;
* Network techniques for WS security, performance evaluation and quality 
of service;
* Multi-agent techniques for WS description, mediation, and discovery;
* Business process modeling for WS composition, orchestration, and 
coordination;
* Business process mining for WS discovery, composition, and coordination;
* Complex data matching for WS discovery and composition.


Important Dates
Regular Paper Submission: February 6, 2009
Authors Notification: March 6, 2009
Final Paper Submission and Registration: March 17, 2009


Keynote Speaker and Panel Discussion
A keynote speaker and a discussion panel are planned. The objective of 
the discussion panel is to discuss the ways of boosting the acceptance 
of Web services by the IT community and make them the technology of 
choice for the development of modern systems. The panel will be open to 
all ICEIS workshop’s and conference’s participants.
