Web based information systems present many challenges including: semantic m=
odeling of diverse information sources, distributed information management,=
 distributed query processing, social and community based application, and =
information mining.=20
Applications of web based information systems range over many domains, from=
 spatial information systems to mobile and networking services.=20
Mobile web creates the need for novel applications based on a range of devi=
ces (phone, PDA, copiers) which are capable of accessing and=20
processing data from multiple sources. Finally, emerging social networking =
services and applications allows user communities to track and=20
share personal location information on the fly with mobile devices.=20
