We apologize if you receive multiple copies of this message.

This 6 month position is proposed by the team Irisa/Pilgrim located at
Enssat (which is part of the University of Rennes 1) in Lannion (22)
FRANCE and will begin in september.

The purpose of this postdoctoral internship is to exploit the fuzzy set
and possibility theories in order to study i) the problem of querying
data sources disseminated over a network in presence of imprecise view
descriptions, and ii) the problem of discovering the most plausible
global schemas that may represent a set of data sources.

Nowadays, many companies publish part of their data via pay (or free)
APIs and/or HTML forms through their websites. It is the case, for
example, of SNCF (_http://www.sncf.com/_), Yellow Pages
(_http://www.pagesjaunes.fr/_) or the website Cinefil
(_http://www.cinefil.com/_) dedicated to cinema. This makes it possible
to develop applications which aggregate data coming from different
sources scattered on the web.

Data hidden behind queryable HTML forms and API is also known as the
/deep web/. Indexation techniques used by web search engines cannot be
directly used to access such data. Indeed, it would be necessary to
exhaustively query all HTML forms, i.e., to submit all possible
combinations of keywords, drop-down menus or check-boxes to each HTML
form, then to index all the resulting pages. Consequently querying them
with search engines is not realistic and integration techniques must be
employed to answer user queries.

The general setting of this project is that of data integration systems
for the deep web. Such systems aim at providing a uniform query
interface, called the global schema, to data sources distributed in a
network. Generally, integration systems assume the existence of i) a
comprehensive global schema for representing distributed and
heterogeneous data and ii) accurate mappings (semantic links) between
the data sources and the global schema. However, the problem of data
heterogeneity is more acute in the context of the web: indeed, the
number of data sources is very large and the data sources are autonomous
and dynamic.

Recently, the database community became interested in proposing new
systems for web-scale integration that take uncertainty into account.
Most of the works along that line use probability theory for capturing
the uncertainty inherent in the process of schema definition or that
associated with data existence, and also to represent the approximate
nature of the semantic mappings between the data sources and the
mediated schema.

However, probability theory is not always well-suited to modelling
uncertainty in the context of data integration, as this uncertainty is
fundamentally not of a frequential nature. An interesting alternative
consists in using fuzzy set theory which allows for modelling
sets/classes whose boundaries are not sharp, and possibility theory
which is strongly connected with it. The latter supplies a qualitative
model for uncertainty where a piece of information is represented by
means of a possibility distribution encoding a complete preorder over
the possible situations.

The applicant should have a PhD thesis in computer science. He/She will
join the research team Pilgrim of IRISA (http://www.irisa.fr/pilgrim).
