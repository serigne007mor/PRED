Final Call for Papers
---------------------

Session on “Decision and Health”
At the First KES International Symposium on Intelligent Decision Technologies -
IDT'09	
Himeji, Japan
23-25 April 2009
http://www.lirmm.fr/TATOO/IDT09


Summary
----------

In many health organisations, decision technologies are getting recognized as a
key component of the process of medical data management. Most of the medical
information now exists in a digital form because of the intensive use of
information and communication technologies in healthcare and in medical
research and management. Consequently, the processing of this medical data
becomes a major topic for health care professionals to understand large volumes
of data.

Decision technologies have been recently experiencing a boom of interest from
researchers and software producers in areas related to health. The results of
such processes are decisive for real-world applications:
- In healthcare, decision technologies are used to understand the data and/or
to find causes of problems in order to provide to the doctors actionable
knowledge in order to treat the patients (e.g. diagnostic systems).
- In medical research, decision applications are still rather rare due to the
difficulties to reproduce the experimentations. However, discovering knowledge
about medical data is critical for medical decision (e.g. side-effects of
therapies, new syndrome).
- In medical management, decision technologies can be used to discover
knowledge about the nature of healthcare practice in an institution/hospital,
at a local/national level (e.g. fraudulent practices detection).

Decision technologies applications to the medical data thus bring unique
opportunities but also new challenges. Indeed, medical data are inherently
heterogeneous, incompletes, with errors, etc. The use of decision technologies
to process this medical data and to discover new knowledge is an important and
ambitious objective to take advantages of the huge volume of medical data.

This session on Decision and Health will be held in IDT, Himeji, Japan, 23-25
April 2009.  The contributors will be selected in order to yield a
multidisciplinary approach.  Together their contributions provide a global
vision of the challenges to be addressed in the next few years as to ensure the
processing of medical data.

----------

- Intelligent medical decision making support systems,
- Managing, querying and mining medical data,
