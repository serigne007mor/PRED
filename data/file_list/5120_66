*Title: Complex data analysis with incomplete or uncertain data*


[Please accept our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this messa=
ge]
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *=20
* * * * * * * * * * * * *

*Duration:* 3 years

*Advisors:*
Christophe Gravier (Pr, Laboratoire Hubert Curien =E2=80=93 UJM, Saint-=C3=
=89tienne,=20
France )
Christine Largeron (Pr, Laboratoire Hubert Curien =E2=80=93 UJM, Saint-=C3=
=89tienne,=20
France)

*Keywords: *Data mining, Machine learning, Social network, Graphs=20
analysis, Uncomplete data

*Context *
In many applications, the data to be studied is relational, modeled in=20
the form of a network and represented by graphs. This representation=20
makes possible the study of interactions between people, especially in=20
social sciences. Although network analysis is an active branch of data=20
min-ing and machine learning, a majority of works in other fields=20
focuses also graphs where the nodes correspond to the entities of the=20
network and the links (edges or arcs) to their relation-ships, for=20
instance in biology or image processing.
Among the main tasks studied on this data, one can mention supervised=20
and unsupervised cluste-ring, link prediction or, recommendation.

*Subject*
One of the main limitations of the existing methods allowing to solve=20
these issues is that they usually consider the network to be fully known=20
so that it can be perfectly defined by a graph or by a sequence of=20
graphs for a dynamic network. However, in practice, the graph is often=20
only partially observable, or the data can be observed with a degree of=20
uncertainty. This uncertainty is derived from the presence or absence of=20
a node (or link) at a given moment and, if applicable, the lack of=20
weight or orientation characterizing the link.
Although it is very widespread in practice, this uncertainty is not=20
without effect on the outcomes resulting from classical graph analysis=20
but it is understudied in the literature. Concerning the classi-fication=20
of entities, one can cite the works of Sevon et al. or Pfeiffer et al..=20
For the prediction of links, Mallek et al., Ahmed et al., Murata et al.=20
Finally for the detection of communities, we can mention Dahlin et al.,=20
Liu et al., Martin et al., Zhang et al. as well as our works (Benyahia=20
et al.). In the frame of Graph Neural Networks, only few works focus on=20
learning attribute-missing graph embeddings (Chen et al.). The=20
applications on many downstream information communication, science and=20
technology domains are nonetheless important, such as in databases=20
(Banerjee et al.) and computer networks (Sasaki et al.). Thus, in this=20
project our objectives are twofold. First, we will study the impact of=20
the incompleteness of the relational data on network algorithms. Second,=20
we will develop methods able to factor nodes and links incompleteness in=20
graph processing algorithms as well as machine learning techniques based=20
on graphs.

*Working environment*
The PhD candidate will work at the Laboratoire Hubert Curien (UMR 5516)=20
under the supervision of=C2=A0 Christophe Gravier and Christine Largeron,=
=20
Professor in Computer Science (LabHC =E2=80=93 Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monne=
t,=20
Saint-Etienne, France).

*Funding*
The PhD fellowship is funded for 3 years through and is monthly funded=20
about approximatively 1500 =E2=82=AC.


*Profile of the candidate*
The candidate should have a master degree or equivalent in Computer=20
Science. The subject is at the intersection of several domains: graph=20
theory, statistics, data mining and machine learning, big data. Thus the=20
candidate should have strong backgrounds in several of these topics.
Other required skills:
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good abilities in algorithm design and progra=
mming.
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good technical skills regarding data mining, =
machine learning and=20

=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 A very good level (written and oral) in Engli=
sh.
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good communication skills (oral and written).
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The ability to work in a team with colleagues=
 from other scientific=20
disciplines.
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Autonomy and motivation for research.

*Application instructions*
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Applicants are invited to contact before *12 April.*

The application file should contain the following documents:

etc.). If the candidate is currently finishing a Master=E2=80=99s degree,=
 s/he=20
