Subject: [liste-egc] European summer school 'Information Foraging' 2012,
 Nijmegen

*Call for Participation*

*2nd European Summer School on Information Foraging 
<http://www.ru.nl/is/ifl/education/ip-2012/>***

27 August – 7 September 2012

*Nijmegen, the Netherlands*

*Course theme: *The goal of the course is to introduce students to 
theoretical models and technology related to all facets of 
(professional) interaction with information in an information seeking 
context. The four subthemes are: 1) information seeking behavior, 2) 
interaction, 3) context an personalized search 4) semantic and social 
annotations. The topic ‘Information Foraging’ reflects the shift of 
attention in information retrieval research from static document 
statistics towards i) on-line systems that are designed for user 
interaction and ii) exploiting the collective information access 
behavior of communities of users. The course has been designed for 
master or PhD students in computer science, information science or 
artificial intelligence. **

*Program: *The course of consists of two full weeks (10 days) of 
lectures. Lectures are usually split across two days, starting in the 
afternoon and continuing the following morning. The school is proud to 
offer a varied program of lectures including basic and more advanced 
courses from 13 different speakers which are experts in their area. 
Moreover, in the second week, there will be a *keynote lecture* by ACM 
Fellow Keith van Rijsbergen, as a counterpoint element in the program.

A final detailed day-to-day program will be available on the website 
shortly. Individual courses have a varied layout, where classroom 
teaching is mixed with group assignments, exercises and practical work.

*How to apply: *Registration is possible via the school webpage: 
http://www.ru.nl/is/ifl/education/ip-2012/***but do register before July 
31**. *The registration fee is *250 Euro for the full 2 week program*. 
This fee does not include any meals or lodging. The organization can 
support students to find a room-mate to reduce hotel costs. The fee does 
include access to all courses, course materials, coffee breaks, banquet 
dinner in the first week and keynote reception in the second week. **

*SIKS grants: *Thanks to the support of SIKS, a fixed number of seats 
(registration cost waivers) are available for students of the Dutch SIKS 
research school. SIKS students can apply using the regular application 
form, they should specify SIKS as additional ‘tag’ in the ‘Program Name’ 
field.

*Support for international students: *We expect to be able to offer 
additional grants for students of European universities. These grants 
will cover registration and part of the travel cost. Information will be 
announced on the website.

*Venue: *The summer school will be located in the Huygens building on 
the *Radboud university campus*, which houses the science faculty. The 
campus is connected to the city centre by a shuttle bus service (approx. 
10 minutes). Cheap lunches and dinner are available at the university 
cafetarias.**

*Organizers: *This 2nd summer school about "Information Foraging" is 
organized by the IFL group @ Radboud University Nijmegen. The school is 
funded by an Intensive Programme grant from the EU Lifelong Learning 
Programme Erasmus, which made it possible to invite speakers from the 
University of Glasgow, Université Paul Sabatier, KU Leuven, Universität 
Duisburg-Essen, University of Amsterdam, Royal School of Library and 
Information Science (Copenhagen), University of Sheffield, University of 
Milano Bicocca and the University of Strathclyde. The summer school is 
endorsed by SIKS, the Dutch research school for Information and 
Knowledge systems.

*Course coordinators*: Wessel Kraaij and Theo P. van der Weide
