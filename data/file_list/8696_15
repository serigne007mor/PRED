AIMS AND SCOPE

In the past, data warehousing and mining technologies have evolved to 
scale and to analyze large volumes of data. There were major advances 
concerning architectures, physical design, indexing, query processing, 
optimization and parallel processing. But the volume, variety and 
velocity of Big Data require us to rethink the mechanisms, to be able to 
cope with the new requirements.

For this special issue, we welcome papers proposing architectures and 
models, physical design mechanisms and infrastructure, mining and 
applications to cope with the challenges raised by Big Data, as well as 
the support and mining of semi-structured and unstructured data in those 
platforms. The aim of the special issue is twofold: on one side, it is 
to present the current research and technological developments in the 
field. Secondly, it is to present new and challenging architectural, 
deployment and application issues.


TOPICS:

We seek original and high quality submissions related (but not limited 
to) to one or more of the following topics:

A. Architectures and Models
* Architectures and Platforms for Processing Big Data Warehouses and Big 
Data
* Theoretical, Computational and Programming Models for Big Data
* Storage Models for Big Data, Data Partitioning
* Architectures for Cluster/Cloud/Grid/Stream Computing
* Programming Models and Environments for Cluster/Cloud/Grid/Stream 
Computing to Support Big Data
* New Programming Models for Big Data
* Big Data as a Service
* Benchmarking of Big Data Warehouses
* Big Data Simulation
* Big Data Security & Privacy

B. Physical Design and Big Data Infrastructure
* Cost Models for Physical Design
* Indexing Big Data
* Energy-efficient Physical Design
* Economical Models for Physical Design
* Self Management, Automatic Tuning

* C. BigData Mining and Applications
* Big Data Mining Algorithms and Applications
* Algorithms and Systems for Big Data Search
* Semantic-based Data Mining and Data Pre-processing
* Cloud/Grid/Stream Data Mining of Big Velocity Data
* Crowdsourcing and Big Data
* Data Pricing Models
* Spatio-temporal and Multimedia BigData Applications
* BigData Recommendation Systems, Graph and link Mining
* Experiences with Big Data Project Development and Deployment

We solicit submissions of high-quality, original research and are 
particularly interested in system-oriented papers and practical use 
cases involving new technologies. We are also happy to consider 
well-written survey articles.
