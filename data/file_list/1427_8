The W3C OWL Web Ontology Language has been a W3C recommendation since 2004.
The OWL: Experiences and Direction (OWLED) workshop series is a forum for
practitioners in industry and academia, tool developers, and others
interested in OWL to describe real and potential applications, to share
experience, and to discuss requirements for language
extensions/modifications. At OWLED 2006 it was agreed to move forward with a
member submission of the OWL 1.1 proposal which extends OWL DL in ways that
have been requested by users, that have effective reasoning algorithms, and
that developers of OWL reasoning systems are willing to support.
The 3rd OWL: Experiences and Directions workshop (OWLED 2007) will again
bring users, implementors and researchers together in order to measure the
current state of need against the state of the art and to set an agenda for
language evolutions that satisfy users. OWLED 2007 shall in particular
present industrial efforts and experiences with OWL. It shall further the
interaction between industry, theoreticians and tool builders, help
consolidate OWL 1.1, clarify the relationships between OWL and rules and
initiate the specification of OWL 2.0.
Building on the success of the 2005 OWLED and the 2006 OWLED workshops, the
2007 OWLED workshop will again be immediately after one of the main Semantic
Web conferences, namely the ESWC conference, and is colocated with the First
International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems, RR2007.

Topics
-------------
OWLED 2007 welcomes the submission of papers about all aspects of OWL and
extensions, application, theory, method, tool, including but not limited to
the following topics:
- All applications of OWL
- Application-driven requirements for OWL
- Implementation techniques for OWL and related languages
- Performance and scalability issues
- Bridges between knowledge engineering and OWL
- Non-standard inference services, including explanations, static
verification, modularity
- Enriching ontologies with rules
- Query answering and data integration
- Tools for OWL including: editors, visualisation tools, parsers and syntax
checkers, versioning frameworks
- Extensions to OWL including: extended datatype constructors, property
constructors, class constructors keys, constraints, rules probabilistic and
fuzzy extensions, non-monotonic extensions, temporal and spatial extensions

****************************************************************************
*************
Submissions of papers on industrial efforts, experiences reports, system
descriptions, position papers (especially about new features or issues with
OWL), and survey papers about theory or tools (for example comparing
different ways of combining rules with OWL) are strongly encouraged. We
particularly welcome:
- Descriptions of industry system or industrial applications
- Experience reports with OWL or OWL 1.1 (or any fragment or extension)
Domain or application ontologies (e-Science, e-Health, e-Culture, e-Learning
etc.)
- Industry requirements
- Life Sciences or other community requirements
- Implementation issues with OWL or OWL 1.1
- Demos with OWL or OWL 1.1
- Reasoning with OWL and rules in practical applications
- Requirements for a potential OWL 2.0 revision
****************************************************************************
*************

Workshop Format
------------------------------
The goal of the workshop will be to maximise discussion. The technical
sessions will therefore consist of short presentations of selected papers
(grouped by topic area) followed by directed discussion. As in prior years,
there will be session(s) devoted to standardization efforts, to some issues
deferred from 2006 (alternative syntaxes, constraints, SPARQL and OWL, rules
and OWL), and a report, with discussion, on the progress of the OWL 1.1 W3C
submission and working group.


Submissions
----------------
Submissions can be either long or short papers. Papers must be no longer
than 10 pages. Short submissions no longer than 4 pages are welcome.
Interested parties may send the organizers a one page description of their
demo.
All submissions must be received before 4 March 2007. All papers must be
submitted online using the submission website (not available yet).
Submissions must be in PDF, and will not be accepted in any other format. It
is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submission
displays and prints correctly on common PDF viewers. Submissions must be
formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes
in Computer Science (LNCS). For details see
http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,5-164-2-72376-0,00.h
tml.
All accepted submissions and demo descriptions will be made available from
the workshop web site; these may be updated with final versions after the
reviewing process. Presentation materials from the workshop will also be
placed on the web site.
All submissions will be reviewed by the workshop committee. Decisions on the
acceptance of papers will be communicated to authors no later than 14 April,
2007.
