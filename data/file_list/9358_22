OVERVIEW
Nowadays, Cultural Heritage is gaining a lot of attention from academic 
and industry perspectives. Scientific researchers, organizations, 
associations, schools are looking for relevant technologies for 
accessing, integrating, sharing, annotating, visualizing, analyzing the 
mine of cultural collections by considering profiles and preferences of 
end users.
Most cultural information systems today process data based on the 
syntactic level without leveraging the rich semantic structures 
underlying the content. Moreover, they use multiple thesauri without a 
formal connection between them. This situation has been identified in 
the 90’s when the need to build a unique interface to access huge 
collection of data has appeared. During the last decades, Semantic Web 
solutions have been proposed to explicit the semantic of data sources 
and make their content machine understandable and interoperable. By 
analyzing the most important conferences and workshops related to the 
Semantic Web, four main categories of topics have been identified: (i) 
the development of Ontologies and vocabularies dedicated to the studied 
domain, (ii) explicitation of collection semantics, (iii) usage of 
Semantic Web Cultural Heritage and (iv) applications related to Cultural 
Heritage.
The aim of our SW4CH Workshop is to bring together Computer Scientists, 
and more precisely Data Scientists, involved in Semantic Web solutions 
for Cultural Heritage. The goal is to exchange experiences, build a 
state of the art of realizations and challenges and reuse and adapt 
solutions that have been proposed in other domains.
