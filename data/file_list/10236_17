The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used=20
to represent, share and process information in various forms, ranging=20
from signal, image, and multimedia data to traditional structured data=20
and semi-structured data found in the web.=20

SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that increasingly play=20
a key role in connecting systems across network centric environments=20
to allow distributed computing and information sharing.=20

SITIS 2013 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on=20
research activities centered on three main tracks:=20

- The first track titled "Web Computing and Applications (WeCA)"=20
focuses on emerging and novel concepts, architectures, technologies,=20
and methodologies for information management related to the Web and=20
cloud computing. In essence, the Web, with its different versions,=20
has created an interconnected world in which information can be=20
exchanged easily, tasks can be processed collaboratively, communities=20
of users with similarly interests can be formed to achieve efficiency=20
and improve performance, etc. Taking full advantage of these=20
interconnected environments to meet the ever increasing needs of=20
emerging applications requires solutions that address new issues=20
and challenges. The track calls for research papers=20
and reports directed at several areas including: Data Semantics,=20
Web-Centric Systems, Big Data, Information System Interoperability,=20
Cloud, Cooperative information and Distributed Systems, and=20
Information security=20

- The second track titled "Signal & Image Technologies (SIT)" focuses=20
on recent developments in digital signal processing and pays particular=20
attention to evolutions in audiovisual signal processing, analysis,=20
coding and authentication, and retrieval techniques.=20
The track calls for research papers and reports directed at several=20
areas including:Image Processing and Analysis, Signal processing,=20
Image/Video Coding and Authentication, and Applications=20

- The third track titled "Multimedia Information Retrieval and Application =
(MIRA)"=20
focuses on emerging modeling, representation and retrieval techniques=20
that take into account the amount, type and diversity of multimedia=20
information accessible in distributed computing environment.=20
The internet, social networking, multimedia databases and management=20
of multimedia cultural collections have created the need for cross-fields=
=20
models, paradigms and techniques for efficient modeling, management and=20
consumption of multimedia contents. The track calls for research papers=20
and reports directed at several areas including=20
Multimedia Query and Retrieval; Mobile and Location-Based Media,=20
