2nd Workshop on Applications of Pattern Analysis (WAPA 2011)
CIEM, Castro Urdiales, Spain
19 - 21 October 2011
http://www.pascal-network.org/wapa2011

*Workshop Description*

Pattern Analysis and Statistical Learning cover a wide range of
technologies and theoretical frameworks, and significant activity in the
past years has resulted in a remarkable convergence and many advances in
the theory and principles underlying the field.

Bringing these technologies to real world demanding applications is
however often treated as a separate problem, one that does not directly
affect the field as a whole. It is instead important to consider the
field of Pattern Analysis as fully including all issues involved with
the applications of this technology, and hence all issues that arise
when deploying, scaling, implementing and using the technology.

We call for constributions in the form of Demos, Case Studies, Working
Systems, Real World Applications and Usage Scenarios. Challenges may
stem from the violation of common theoretical assumptions, from the
specific types of patterns and noise arising in certain scenarios, or
from the problem of scaling up the implementation of state of the art
algorithms to real world sizes, or from the creation of integrated
software systems that contain multiple pattern-analysis components.

We are also interested in new application areas, where Pattern Analysis
has been deployed with success, and in issues involving the
visualisation and delivery and exploitation of the patterns discovered
by PA technologies. Systems working in noisy and unstructured
environments and situations are particularly interesting.

The goal is to discuss and reward work aimed at making theory useful and
relevant, without requesting the researchers to propose new theoretical
methods, but rather requesting to show how they solved the many
challenges related to applying these methods to real world scenarios, or
how they benefited other fields of research. Getting ideas to work in
real scenarios is what this is about.

*Call For Papers*

We welcome papers and demos in all of the areas described in the
Workshop Description. Papers should be max 7 pages long, in PDF, font
size 12, describing a working system that makes use of Pattern Analysis
technology and for which interesting challenges were encountered and
overcome during its deployment, or an application that has benefited
another field of research. Software and Web demos are welcome, as are
case studies.

Papers should be submitted on EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wapa2011

Submission Deadline: 15 June 2011

Proceedings will be published containing the accepted papers within the
JMLR Proceedings Series: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/
