Title: Using Abduction to Explain Missing Entailments in OWL Ontologies
Patrick Koopmann, TU Dresden=20

Abstract: With increasing complexity, understanding and debugging ontol=
ogies becomes a challenging task without the appropriate tool support. =
In particular, inferences performed by a reasoner may not always be str=
aight-forward, meaning they may produce entailments that we did not exp=
ect, or fail to produce entailments that we did expect. While there are=
 different techniques to explain entailments, this talk focusses on the=
 problem of explaining why something does not follow from the ontology.=
 In particular, we explain how abduction may be used towards solving th=
is issue, and discuss challenges and solutions for performing abduction=
 in practice.

Series Description
------------------
The IAOA [2] has created ESAO, a new educational effort directed toward=
s topics of Applied Ontology, primarily established basics and foundati=
ons.

The series is inspired by the Interdisciplinary Schools on Applied Onto=
logy (ISAO) [3] (whose next edition will be held in 2023). ESAO is comp=
lementary in format and its overall approach. The goal is to provide a =
combination of an archive of educational material (e.g., short video le=
ctures) and a series of webinars for presenting and discussing that mat=
erial.

Organization
------------
Members of the Education Technical Committee of IAOA [2] and among thos=
e primarily (in alphabetical order):

* Frank Loebe
