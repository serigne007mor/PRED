KDD-2009: The Fifteenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge
Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09)

Paris, France
June 28 - July 1, 2009

http://www.kdd.org/kdd2009/
=================================================================

The ACM KDD-2009 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops to
be held in conjunction with the conference. The purpose of a workshop is
to provide participants with the opportunity to present and discuss novel
research ideas on active and emerging topics of knowledge discovery and
data mining. A workshop should also support the interaction and feedback
among topic specialists from academia, industry and government.

A workshop may be organized around around industrial applications in a
particular domain and the challenges this domain poses, such as the
Netflix workshop on recommender systems
(http://netflixkddworkshop2008.info/).

A workshop may also include a challenge problem, such as the one on time
series classification that took place in 2007
(http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/SIGKDD2007TimeSeries.html). A session with
papers that address a challenge complements the more diverse sessions with
regular papers and improves the potential for discussion. Because such
challenges require extra time to plan, we may be willing to provide early
notice of acceptance.

The organizers of approved workshops are required to announce the workshop
and call for papers, gather submissions, conduct the reviewing process and
decide upon the final workshop program. They must also prepare an informal
set of workshop proceedings to be distributed with the registration
materials at the conference. They may choose to form organizing or program
committees for assistance in these tasks. The logistics of the workshops
will be done with the help from the ACM KDD-2009 organizers.

========================================================================
