TITLE: PhD on behavioural stochastic modelling and the dynamics of
human attention in the online environment
DEADLINE: 21 June 2019
PhD START: January 2020
 
ORGANISATION AND LOCATION: Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of
Technology Sydney, Australia
WEBSITE: 
https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology
 
DESCRIPTION OF JOB:
We are seeking a PhD to join the Behavioral Data Science team in
Sydney, Australia. The position is for 3.5 years. The position will
remain open until a good candidate is found. The project aims at
developing and evaluating stochastic models for the spread of
information over complex social networks, in which the individual
actions -- such as retweets, posts or shares -- are only partially
observed. This can arise when only the actions of particular
individuals are observed (say, when following some individuals on
Twitter), or when only counts of actions are recorded (as in the case
of Youtube attention series). 

The PhD student will be located within the newly formed DataSci
Research  Centre at UTS, in the Behavioral Data Science group. DataSci
counts 15 members, with research interests spanning across smart
logistics, transportation, and human dynamics. The Research Centre has
both strong ties with industry, as well as world-class research,
providing the ideal
 environment for solving real-world originating issues, in close
proximity to both academia and industry.  

PROJECT SUPERVISOR & HOSTING GROUP
Marian-Andrei Rizoiu will be the supervisor. He is the leader of the
Behavioral Data Science team at the DataSci. 
 
CANDIDATE ’S PROFILE
Interested candidates must have solid background knowledge in
statistics, machine learning, and strong programming capabilities.
Experience with big social data, extracting and handling web- and
social media-originating data is a big plus. We are looking for a
candidate with a master by research qualification, and demonstrated
research capabilities (preferably through publications). Candidates
with publications in major conferences/journals will be prioritised.
The position will be open until the ideal candidate is identified. 
 
FUNDING CONDITIONS
Living allowance of 27k$/year tax free.
 
CONTACT AND CONTACT EMAIL:
Interested applicants should email their a cover letter, their CV
(preferably with contact information of 2 references)  and transcript
of university course grades to Marian-Andrei.Rizoiu@uts.edu.au . Also
for any other inquiries please write to Marian-Andrei.Rizoiu@uts.edu.au
