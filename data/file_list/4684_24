*CALL FOR PAPERS*

The *2nd International Workshop on Education in Artificial Intelligence 
K-12 (EduAI)*
July 6 or 7, 2020 (t.b.d.)
Virtual Event, held in conjunction with AIED-2020
http://eduai.ist.tugraz.at/

The second International Workshop on Education in Artificial 
Intelligence K-12 (EduAI) addresses the emerging topic of education in 
AI at the K-12 level. The workshop will be held online, as part of the 
AIED workshop program . It represents a unique opportunity to bring 
together leading AI scientists with education researchers, educators and 
practitioners who focus on and are interested in K-12 AI education.


_Important Dates_

  * Submission deadline: June 7, 2020
  * Notification of acceptance: June 14, 2020
  * Submission of camera ready papers: June 21, 2020
  * Workshop date: July 6-7, 2020


_Description_

In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has captured the attention 
of the public, and become a major topic of discussion. AI already has a 
significant influence on various areas of life and across different 
sectors and fields. The rapidity with which AI is impacting our everyday 
life as well as our working world poses a tremendous challenge for our 
society and educational system. Sound knowledge about AI, its principles 
and concepts, the ability to apply AI techniques and methods, coupled 
with the ability to analyze their long-term benefits, are becoming 21st 
century key skills. They are the basis for creating career opportunities 
and fostering a broad common understanding of AI applications and 
products. As a consequence, this also enables people to better estimate 
potential opportunities and possible risks of those upcoming 
technologies. Access to basic AI literacy, education and tools will also 
reduce the danger of social or economic exclusion of certain groups of 
people, especially women and minorities.  In this context it is 
essential to introduce fundamental concepts and techniques of AI from an 
early age. In doing so, a convenient byproduct will be the involvement 
of the child’s caregivers – parents and educators, who willalso become 
AI-literate.

_Aims and Scope_

Teaching fundamental AI concepts and techniques has traditionally been 
done at the university level. Education in AI at the K-12 level is still 
quite rare. However, in recent years several initiatives and projects 
pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. The main goal of 
this workshop is to bring together people who are actively involved with 
and/or interested in K-12 AI education (researchers, teachers, 
educators, practitioners) and top AI scientists, fostering a mutual 
exchange of knowledge, ideas and views between those groups. The 
workshop aims to present initiatives, projects, ideas and best practice 
examples, to get input from leading AI researchers, and to discuss 
current work, possible cooperation and future directions in the context 
of AI education in schools. Furthermore, it aims to discuss and find a 
common ground for how to best implement AI education at the K-12 level.

_Topic Areas_

We invite submissions of research papers from researchers, 
practitioners, and educators interested in education in AI at K-12 level 
(primary, secondary). Topics of interests include (but are not limited to):

* K-12 AI educational initiatives and projects
* AI curricula
* AI teaching concepts and materials
* social, ethical and economic aspects of AI, human factors
* software and hardware tools in AI education and how those tools could 
improve teaching
* AI in education
* best practices for training educators to teach about AI
* parental involvement in AI-literacy
* approaches dealing with the question of what should be taught to 
prepare youth for a digitized world

We also welcome discussions of best practice examples and hands-on 
demonstrations of AI teaching approaches at K-12 level.

_Submission Instructions_

Please submit your contribution as an extended abstract of 2 pages 
maximum. The contribution should be formatted according to the guidlines 
of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
(https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). 
Please submit your contribution via the Easy Chair submission system 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eduai2020).
