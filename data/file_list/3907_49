###### EnGeoData'2023: Geospatial data analysis under the umbrella of =
One Health

### AIMS AND TOPICS


1. Abstract

Current context of urbanization, globalization, high mobility/trade, and =
climate change amid the health domain favors the (re-) emergence of =
known and unknown diseases.  Thus, geospatial and environmental data =
analysis for One Health is crucial to provide insights into the =
connections between humans, animals, and environment. This type of =
analysis allows us to identify and monitor health issues that arise due =
to the interactions between these three areas. However, it is =
challenging due to: (1) the multi-modality of the data (e.g., =
unstructured, imaging, semantic, spatial, temporal, among others); and =
(2) the difficulty in choosing the "most appropriate=E2=80=9D knowledge =
discovery process according to specific field needs (e.g., animal, plant =
or human health; crisis and disaster surveillance).=20

EnGeoData 2023 aims to provide high quality research facing the =
challenges mentioned above with theoretical and/or experimental =
approaches.


2. Topics

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Pre and post processing of environmental data
- Geographical information retrieval
- Spatial data mining, spatial data warehousing, and spatial data lake
- Knowledge discovery use-cases applied to environmental data
- Spatial text mining
- Spatial ontology
- Spatial recommendation and personalization
- Visual analytics for geo-spatial data
- Dedicated applications:
    * Spatio-temporal analytics platform
    * Agricultural decision support systems
    	* Urban traffic systems
    	* Trajectory analysis
    	* Land-use and urban policies
    	* Land-use and urban planning analysis
    	* Spatio-temporal analysis in ecology and agriculture
    	* Disease surveillance systems (One Health)

### SUBMISSION

All papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair Submissions: =
https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=3Ddsaa2023 under the =E2=80=9CSpe=
cial Session=E2=80=9D Track

- Paper Submission Deadline: May 22, 2023
- Paper Notification: July 17, 2023
- Paper Camera Ready Due: August  7, 2023

The length of each paper submitted to the special session should be no =
more than ten (10) pages and should be formatted following the standard =
2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. For further =

All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the =
basis of technical quality, relevance to the session=E2=80=99s topics of =
interest, originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and =
affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic =
references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions =
failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be =
rejected without reviews.	=09
