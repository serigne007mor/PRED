BPM 2011

9th International Conference on Business Process Management 2011

August 29-September 2, Clermont-Ferrand, France

http://bpm2011.isima.fr

===============================================================

Abstract submissions: 13 March 2011

Final paper submissions: 20  March 2011

Call for Research Papers: http://bpm2011.isima.fr/cfp.html

Submission guidelines: http://bpm2011.isima.fr/submission.html

===============================================================

BPM 2011 is the ninth conference in a series that provides the most
distinguished research forum for researchers and practitioners in all
aspects of BPM including theory, frameworks, methods, techniques,
architectures, systems, and empirical findings. With an acceptance rate
in previous editions at around 13% the conference has a record of
attracting innovative research of highest quality, from a mix of
disciplines including Computer Science, Management Information Science,
Services Computing, Services Science, and Technology Management.

This year's conference will continue with the broad-based themes of
previous editions, and strives to strengthen and expand in several key
directions . The conference  encourages emerging research on new
conceptual models for BPM that attempt to unify core aspects of BPM,
including process management, data management, business rules and
requirements, and analytics. The conference also encourages the
increasing interest in applying established and new techniques, such as
model-driven architectures, Web services and Web architectures, SOA, and
Cloud Computing, to the specific challenges of BPM. In this context, the
conference is also looking for contributions on implementation
techniques and details for process or Web service execution engines with
focus on new application areas. Finally, the conference seeks to attract
papers that highlight the pervasive need for BPM capabilities across
application areas outside of business management, including healthcare
delivery, digital government, disaster management, and management of
scientific and other academic endeavors, and that highlight how new
techniques can solve the distinctive challenges arising in those diverse
areas. Awards will be given to the best papers in different categories.

BPM 2011 will be held in Clermont-Ferrand, France, and will be organized
by the LIMOS Laboratory (http://www.isima.fr/limos/), CNRS, Université
Blaise Pascal. The conference will take place at the campus des cezeaux
which is located about minutes from the city center. Clermont-Ferrand is
a medium-sized city located in the heart of Auvergne, one of the most
beautiful regions of France: ancient volcanoes, lakes and gorges,
historic sites and Romanesque architecture make its wealth. Information
about the venue and local area are provided on the conference website:
http://bpm2011.isima.fr/ .
