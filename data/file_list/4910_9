********************************
Overview:
********************************
=09
Machine learning and knowledge graphs are currently essential =
technologies for designing and building large scale distributed =
intelligent systems. Machine learning is a well established field, which =
has currently gained a high momentum due to the advances in the =
computational infrastructures, availability of Big Data, and appearance =
of new techniques such as deep learning. In fact, Deep Learning methods =
have become an important area of research, achieving some important =
breakthrough in various research fields, especially Natural Language =
Processing (NLP), Image and Speech Recognition.

Knowledge Graphs are large networks of real-world entities described in =
terms of their semantic types and their relationships to each other. =
Knowledge graphs is a recent technology with very high practical impact: =
examples include the Google Knowledge Graph with over 70 billion facts =
(in 2016), dataCommons, DBPedia, YAGO and YAGO2, Wikidata and Knowledge =
Vault, a very large scale probabilistic knowledge graph created with =
information extraction methods for unstructured or semi-structured =
information. Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means of =
development of the newest methods for data management, data fusion / =
data merging, and graph and network optimization and modeling, serving =
as a source of high quality data and a base for ubiquitous information =
integration. While Knowledge Graphs provide explicit knowledge =
representations in terms of underlying ontologies based on symbolic =
logic, machine learning, such as Deep Learning technologies, provide =
implicit or latent r!
epresentations of the knowledge contained in their models.

Although machine learning (and particularly, recently deep learning) and =
Knowledge Graphs technologies have been deployed separately, in the last =
years, the first works combining these technologies are showing large =
potential in solving many real-world challenges.

In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical =
that the communities related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning and =
Knowledge Graphs join their forces in order to develop more effective =
algorithms and applications. In particular, two main technology =
directions solicited for this special issue are as follows:

i) Improved Machine Learning with Knowledge Graphs: employing semantic =
models and linked data for the training steps, learning effective =
representation from the Knowledge Graphs for the tasks of feature =
extraction, classification, prediction and decision making. A successful =
example here includes IBM Watson question answering system, that has =
outperformed the best human players of an intellectual TV quiz show =
"jeopardy!"

ii) Machine Learning for Improving Knowledge Graphs: while capturing =
semantics correctly is impossible without at least some human =
involvement, machine learning can assist the knowledge acquisition of =
the semantic structures substantially. For example, knowledge graphs can =
be created by employing Deep learning, and then subsequently verified by =
the humans.

A feature that explains the learnt knowledge graphs to the human needs =
to be inbuilt in the learning and verification process, making the =
resulting knowledge graph design solutions explainable to humans. Thus, =
the knowledge graphs created in this manner may be more efficient and =
provide more insights than the ones created solely by humans.

The solicited contributions may comprise an overview of the outlined =
fields, and new technical solutions applicable to such use cases as =
manufacturing / smart factory, production 4.0 and its control of =
quality, mobility, smart cities, smart homes and buildings, energy =
efficiency, health and wellbeing, life sciences, libraries and archives, =
art.

Such use cases require both the analysis of data (e.g. sensor readings, =
distributed data processing) - i.e. quantitative information, and as =
well as qualitative (e.g. information semantically defining the =
production quality criteria and what is considered to be the deviation =
from them). As physical infrastructures and architectures (stemming from =
the fields of Grid and Cloud Computing, Big Data and Internet of =
Things), have a very high impact on the solutions to be suggested, we =
consider that Future Generation Computer Systems is the perfect venue =
for publishing this special issue, given the research area of the =
journal.
