OVERVIEW
Nowadays, Cultural Heritage is gaining a lot of attention from academic and=
 industry perspectives. Scientific researchers, organizations, associations=
, schools are looking for relevant technologies for accessing, integrating,=
 sharing, annotating, visualizing, analyzing the mine of cultural collectio=
ns by considering profiles and preferences of end users.
Most cultural information systems today process data based on the syntactic=
 level without leveraging the rich semantic structures underlying the conte=
nt. Moreover, they use multiple thesauri without a formal connection betwee=
n them. This situation has been identified in the 90=E2=80=99s when the nee=
d to build a unique interface to access huge collection of data has appeare=
d. During the last decades, Semantic Web solutions have been proposed to ex=
plicit the semantic of data sources and make their content machine understa=
ndable and interoperable. By analyzing the most important conferences and w=
orkshops related to the Semantic Web, four main categories of topics have b=
een identified: (i) the development of Ontologies and vocabularies dedicate=
d to the studied domain, (ii) explicitation of collection semantics, (iii) =
usage of Semantic Web Cultural Heritage and (iv) applications related to Cu=
ltural Heritage.
The aim of our SW4CH Workshop is to bring together Computer Scientists, and=
 more precisely Data Scientists, involved in Semantic Web solutions for Cul=
tural Heritage. The goal is to exchange experiences, build a state of the a=
rt of realizations and challenges and reuse and adapt solutions that have b=
een proposed in other domains.
