21-24 September 2021, Bucharest, Romania

+++++++++++++++++++++
First Call for Papers
=20
Important Dates (Time zone: Anywhere on Earth)
---------------
=E2=80=A2    Submission of All Papers: 3 May 202128 April 2021
=E2=80=A2    Notification of Acceptance: 4 June 20217 June 2021
=E2=80=A2    Camera Ready Copy due: 25 June 202121 June 2021
=E2=80=A2    Conference: 21-24 September 2021
=20
The CLEF Conference addresses all aspects of Information Access in any =
modality and language. The CLEF conference includes presentation of =
research papers and a series of workshops presenting the results of =
lab-based comparative evaluation benchmarks. CLEF 2021 in Bucharest is =
the 12th year of the CLEF Conference series and the 22nd year of the =
CLEF initiative as a forum for information retrieval (IR) evaluation. =
The CLEF conference has a clear focus on experimental IR as carried out =
within evaluation forums (e.g., CLEF Labs, TREC, NTCIR, FIRE, MediaEval, =
RomIP, SemEval, and TAC) with special attention to the challenges of =
multimodality, multilinguality, and interactive search also considering =
specific classes of users as children, students, impaired users in =
different tasks (e.g., academic, professional, or everyday-life). We =
invite paper submissions on significant new insights demonstrated on IR =
test collections, on analysis of IR test collections and evaluation =
measures, as well as on concrete proposals to push the boundaries of the =
Cranfield style evaluation paradigm.

All submissions to the CLEF main conference will be reviewed on the =
basis of relevance, originality, importance, and clarity. CLEF welcomes =
papers that describe rigorous hypothesis testing regardless of whether =
the results are positive or negative. CLEF also welcomes past =
runs/results/data analysis and new data collections. Methods are =
expected to be written so that they are reproducible by others, and the =
logic of the research design is clearly described in the paper. The =
conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes =
in Computer Science (LNCS).
=20
Topics
------
Relevant topics for the CLEF 2021 Conference include but are not limited =
to:
=E2=80=A2    Information Access in any language or modality: information =
retrieval, image retrieval, question answering, search interfaces and =
design, infrastructures, etc.
=E2=80=A2    Analytics for Information Retrieval: theoretical and =
practical results in the analytics field that are specifically targeted =
for information access data analysis, data enrichment, etc.
=E2=80=A2    User studies either based on lab studies or crowdsourcing.
=E2=80=A2    Past results/run deep analysis both statistically and fine =
grain based.
=E2=80=A2    Evaluation initiatives: conclusions, lessons learned, =
impact and projection of any evaluation initiative after completing =
their cycle.
=E2=80=A2    Evaluation: methodologies, metrics, statistical and =
analytical tools, component based, user groups and use cases, =
ground-truth creation, impact of multilingual/multicultural/multimodal =
differences, etc.
=E2=80=A2    Technology transfer: economic impact/sustainability of =
information access approaches, deployment and exploitation of systems, =
use cases, etc.
=E2=80=A2    Interactive Information Retrieval evaluation: the =
interactive evaluation of information retrieval systems using =
user-centered methods, evaluation of novel search interfaces, novel =
interactive evaluation methods, simulation of interaction, etc.
=E2=80=A2    Specific application domains: Information access and its =
evaluation in application domains such as cultural heritage, digital =
libraries, social media, expert search, health information, legal =
documents, patents, news, books, plants, etc.
=E2=80=A2    New data collection: presentation of new data collection =
with potential high impact on future research, specific collections from =
companies or labs, multilingual collections.
=E2=80=A2    Work on data from rare languages, collaborative, social =
data.
=20
Format
------
Authors are invited to electronically submit original papers, which have =
not been published and are not under consideration elsewhere, using the =
LNCS proceedings format:
=
http://www.springer.com/it/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-gu=
idelines

Two types of papers are solicited:
=E2=80=A2   Long papers: 12 pages max (including references). Aimed to =
report complete research work.
=E2=80=A2   Short papers: 6 pages max (including references). Position =
papers, new evaluation proposals, developments and applications, etc.
=20
Papers will be peer-reviewed by 3 members of the program committee. =
Selection will be based on originality, clarity, and technical quality. =
Papers should be submitted in PDF format to the following address:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dclef2021

CLEF 2021 will solicit applications from students that are either =
authors of papers to be presented at CLEF, or participants of some CLEF =
lab to waive the CLEF registration fee. Applications will start on June =
7th and end by June 21st, while a committee will select the successful =
candidates. More information will soon be posted on the CLEF 2021 =
webpage.
