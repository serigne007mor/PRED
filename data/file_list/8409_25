Subject: [liste-egc] GKR@IJCAI 2013 - Last Call for Papers

 ==============================GKR@IJCAI 2013 LAST CALL FOR 
 PAPERS=========================================

 THE THIRD IJCAI INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON GRAPH STRUCTURES FOR 
 KNOWLEDGE
 REPRESENTATION AND REASONING

 =====================================================================================================

 Graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning is a growing area of
 research, with more and more important contributions appearing over the
 last few years.

 The workshop welcomes contributions that:

 -- address graph-based representation, query and reasoning paradigms
 (e.g. Baysian Networks (BNs), Semantic Networks (SNs), RDF/S, SPARQL \&
 RIF, Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Euler
 Diagrams, CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, abstract argumentation frameworks etc.)
 from a theoretical and application viewpoint or

 -- apply graph-theoretic results to existing KR formalisms for 
 reasoning
 optimization purposes.

 Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to
 demonstrate the benefits of the proposed solutions. Examples of such
 domains include Semantic Web, Grid Computing, BioInformatics, Multi
 Agent Systems, Recommender Systems etc.

 The GKR 2013 opens a special graph database demonstration and
 application track. Papers submitted to this track should report on
 theory, implementation results and applications of graph databases.
 Short demo papers are also welcome.

 For more details please check: www.lirmm.fr/~croitoru/GKR

 =====================================================================================================

 Paper deadline: April 20th, 2013
 Notification: May 20th, 2013
 Workshop date: August 3rd - 5th, 2013 (one day workshop)

 Post Proceedings of the workshop will be published in a special issue 
 of
 the Springer LNAI Series.

 --Madalina Croitoru (LIRMM, France)

 --Christophe Gonzales (LIP6, France)

 --Sebastian Rudolph (KIT, Germany)
