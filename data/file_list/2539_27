Dear colleagues,

We are looking for an enthusiastic student interested in a three-year =
Phd thesis on Network Science and Machine Learning for Resilience =
Characterisation and Optimisation of Large-scale Multi-modal Mobility =
Networks
that will take place at the LICIT lab of University Gustave Eiffel and =
ENTPE in Lyon, France.
Please, consider sharing this call among potential candidates and =
colleagues.
Deadline to apply: 15th September 2021

Context

In the last decade, the multi-modal mobility system of large cities has =
been profoundly jeopardized by a variety of sudden and extreme =
perturbations. According to the World Economic Forum=E2=80=99s Global =
Risks Report 2019, extreme weather events are among the global risks of =
highest concern. Heavy precipitation, along with associated flooding in =
urban mega-regions, has been on the rise both in intensity and frequency =
under the dual forcings of climate change and rapid urbanization. =
Similarly, in recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically =
transformed human mobility habits, leading to globally unprecedented =
decline in transit ridership as well as drastic reduction of capacity of =
transit as a consequence of social distancing.

These factors of vulnerability related to transport are exacerbated by =
the fact that a transportation network is a complex entity composed of =
multiple interdependent subsystems (underground, train, tramway, bus =
transit, and road network), which are spatially constrained and that =
also rely on other urban infrastructure systems such as the power grid =
and communication networks. Thus, even limited disruptions in one =
component of this complex system, often triggered by exogenous and =
hardly predictable events, can lead to a severe loss of lifeline =
functions via cascading failures. Furthermore, as urban mobility systems =
are becoming increasingly connected and autonomous, one should also =
consider the growing threat of opportunistically targeted cyber-attacks =
designed to take advantage of natural hazard events.
This thesis focuses on the cutting-edge issue of characterizing, =
monitoring, and improving the resilience and robustness of complex =
systems, and, particularly, urban mobility systems of large =
metropolises. To advance the state-of-the-art in the field it is =
nowadays necessary to mobilize knowledge and skills from multiple =
research domains, including artificial intelligence and data science, =
mathematical optimization and graph theory.

In this context, it is expected to investigate multi-disciplinary =
approaches leveraging the combination of graph theory and data science, =
machine learning and, possibly, mathematical programming tools towards:

advancing the understanding and characterisation of the resilience of =
dynamic multi-modal urban mobility systems by means of graph modelling, =
network metrics, and the analysis and learning of historical data =
(available for the real-world multi-modal transport network of Lyon, =
France);
defining original techniques and tools to design complex disruptive =
scenarios, that could couple targeted attacks, weather-related phenomena =
as well as sudden variations of the mobility demand and offer of the =
transport system induced by exogenous factors (floods, pandemic, etc.);
evaluating their impacts on the performance of the existing transit =
system in terms of network science metrics and, possibly, by means of =
simulation.
The thesis may also explore solutions for resilience enhancement based =
on network design and mathematical programming strategies.
Research Objectives

The PhD student will have to advance current methodologies developed =
within the team on resilience analysis and optimization of complex =
transportation networks.
She/he will have to develop as well novel and efficient approaches based =
on network science, resilience metrics, and perturbation scenario design =
for the characterisation of the resilience of a multimodal transport =
system.

The phd program is highly flexible and can be adapted based on the =
profile and skills of the candidate.
However, it is expected that the successful candidate will contribute to =
top-tier network science, machine learning, data analytics and =
transportation conferences and journals (NetSci, Networks, Applied =
Network Science, IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering, =
International Conference on Data Mining, KDD, Transportation Research =
Board, IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems, Transportation Research =
Part B, C, E, etc.).

Place of work

LICIT: Transport and Traffic Engineering Laboratory, University Gustave =
Eiffel, University of Lyon - ENTPE

Lyon, France

Expected Candidate Profile

Level of qualifications required:

Master-2 degree, 5-years engineer diploma or equivalent in Computer =
Science, Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Physics, =
Mathematics or strictly-related field.

Skills

The ideal candidate should be highly motivated in carrying out research =
activity, possess high scientific curiosity and a high-degree of =
autonomy, and own a documented expertise in network science, data =
science, programming, and machine learning. A Master 2 or equivalent =
degree in one of the fields above is required.

Good knowledge of Python and/or R scripting languages is required.

Proven written and verbal communication skills with fluency in written =
and spoken English are a must.

Knowledge of big data tools is recommended.

Knowledge or previous experience with operations research tools, =
transport modelling, (traffic) simulation will be helpful and highly =
appreciated during the selection process.

The phd program is highly flexible and can be adapted based on the =
profile and skills of the candidate.
