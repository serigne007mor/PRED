************  January 25-29, 2015, Austin, Texas USA ************

http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2015/aaai15aiweb.php

The AI and the Web track at AAAI-15 invites research papers which are
related to both artificial intelligence and the world wide web. This
includes work describing the application of AI techniques applied to
issues concerning the world wide web, and work which describes the use
of world wde web resources or techniques to drive AI systems. Papers
should clearly describe how their methods or contributions relate to
the world wide web. The track also includes papers focusing more
generally on "data" aspects which are not necessarily web focused.
