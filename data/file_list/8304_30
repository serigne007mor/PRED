EU PROJECT NETWORKING SESSION @ ESWC2013. May 28, 2013. Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/program/eu-project-networking


CALL FOR EU PROJECT NETWORKING
The EU project networking track of the ESWC2013 will provide an opportunity for
* Knowledge sharing among EU projects
* Presentation and discussion of project results with ESWC participants
* Networking with officials from the European Commission

The project networking track is intended to provide EU projects with the ability to connect with each other and engage in discussions about their respective research and development, establish opportunities for knowledge and technology sharing, and identify complementary activities and goals which can form the basis for future collaborations, research proposals, researcher exchange or joint participation at events or in initiatives. EC officials will be present for related discussions.


SUBMISSION
Projects willing to participate at the session must submit a 2-page extended abstract (PDF, Springer LNCS style). The abstract should introduce the EU funded R&D project, briefly describe its R&D activities and goals, outline what the project would show / demonstrate in the session and specify what the project expects to gain from networking with other projects (what it offers, what it is looking for).

Submissions will be evaluated by a separate Program Committee. There will be a limited number of places for EU projects in the networking space. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to ESWC2013, tangible innovation and uniqueness in the R&D activities and a clear goal to benefit from networking with other projects.

Submission will be through the Easychair system: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2013


IMPORTANT DATES
Abstract submission deadline                 April 26th, 2013, 23:59 Hawaii Time
Notification of acceptance/rejection         May 2nd, 2013
