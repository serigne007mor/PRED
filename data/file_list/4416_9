QAUCA'20
Second international workshop on Qualitative Aspects of User-Centered =
Analytics=20

Lyon, France, August 25 , 2020=20
colocated with ADBIS 2020

https://sites.google.com/view/qauca2020

We are pleased to announce the second edition of the QAUCA Workshop! The =
program of the first workshop included 5 research papers and 1 keynote =
talk. This second edition is planned to be a full-day event.

Interactive analytics, often called Interactive Data Analysis (IDA) in =
the literature, is an interactive, iterative process in which a user =
issues an analysis action over potentially big datasets, receives a =
result set, and decides if and which action to issue next, with the =
ultimate goal of answering an informational need not necessarily well =
defined initially. IDA has attracted a lot of attention recently, as it =
is a difficult and tedious process, especially for inexperienced users, =
where targets may not be well defined and little is known about the =
structure and content of the sources. In particular, users are expected =
to undergo on their own what is often considered as a complex lifecycle: =
identify and collect sources, clean and transform them, etc. up to the =
interactive exploration by means of querying, on the fly building of =
Machine Learning models, etc.

The QAUCA workshop originally ambitions to gather researchers and =
practitioners around topics pertaining to the user-centered aspects of =
IDA, with a particular focus on the qualitative aspect of the =
interactive analytic process and the support of inexperienced users. In =
this edition of QAUCA we particularly welcome contributions about topics =
related to relations between users and AI systems such as: =
explainability in ML or recommender systems, fairness approaches or =
multi-stakeholders systems that account for different users =
perspectives.

Contributions may describe original research, practical experiences, =
evaluation results, or novel approaches and applications. Papers =
submitted should be at most twelve (12) pages long (including all =
references and figures). In addition, we welcome technical summaries of =
previous research relevant to the workshop as short paper submissions of =
up to eight (8) pages long (including all references and figures). =
Papers of this kind outline work of the authors that has already been =
published in other venues, and highlight the relevant future directions. =
Finally, we accept position, outrageous idea and vision papers of up to =
eight (8) pages long (including all references and figures). Submissions =
should have their type mentioned within, as a title footnote (i.e., =
technical, summary or position paper).


Research topics include, but are not limited to:

- Quality aspects of interactive analysis: measuring exploration =
outcome, end-user experience of data analysis, assessing subjective =
interestingness, benchmarking interactive analytics.

- Improving user experience: automatic data exploration, intelligent =
assistant for data analysis.

- Explainability of IDA: interpretable models, causality, counterfactual =
analysis.

- Fairness: machine learning, recommender systems.

- Recommendation: multi stakeholders systems, cognitive filter bubble.

- User-centered methods and techniques for improving analytics through =
visualization, reformulation, approximate query-answering, =
personalization, result presentation and data storytelling.

- Models and language for user-centered analytics.

- Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, =
information retrieval, and search engines.

- Real life applications of user-centered analytics and case studies.

- Facilitating analytics for the non data scientists: data journalists, =
decision makers, data enthusiasts and others.



Important dates
Paper submission: April 30, 2020
Acceptance notification: May 22, 2020
Camera ready: June 5, 2020
Workshop: August 25, 2020


Submission instructions
