Call for Papers : Machine Learning in Image Processing

Images have always played an important role in human life since vision 
probably is human beings' most important sense. As a consequence, the 
field of image processing has numerous applications (medical, military, 
etc.). Nowadays and more than ever, images are everywhere and it is very 
easy for everyone to generate a huge amount of images thanks to the 
advances in digital technologies. With such a profusion of images, 
traditional image processing techniques have to cope with more complex 
problems and have to face with their adaptability according to human 
vision. Vision being complex, machine learning has emerged as a key 
component of intelligent computer vision programs when adaptation is 
needed (e.g., face recognition) . Among the existing methods, one can 
quote neural networks, hidden Markov models, kernel based methods, and 
so forth. However, this mainly concerns the computer vision field, the 
learning of which emulates high-level vision processes (e.g., visual 
information categorization or interpretation). But one can also 
incorporate learning in image processing to emulate low-level vision 
processes. We can quote edge detection, noise filtering, adaptive 
compression, and so on, as such potential issues. With the advent of 
image datasets and benchmarks, machine learning and image processing 
have recently received a lot of attention. An innovative integration of 
machine learning in image processing is very likely to have a great 
benefit to the field, which will contribute to a better understanding of 
complex images. The number of image processing algorithms that 
incorporate some learning components is expected to increase, as 
adaptation is needed. However, an increase in adaptation is often linked 
to an increase in complexity and one has to efficiently control any 
machine learning technique to properly adapt it to image processing 
problems. Indeed, processing huge amounts of images means being able to 
process huge quantities of data often of high dimensions, which is 
problematic for most machine learning techniques. Therefore, an 
interaction with the image data and with image priors is necessary to 
drive model selection strategies.

The primary purpose of this special issue is to increase the awareness 
of image processing researchers to the impact of machine learning 
algorithms in low-level tasks. Papers submitted to this special issue 
have to carefully address the problem of model selection (features 
selection, parameter or hyperparameters estimation) for the machine 
learning technique under consideration.

This special issue aims at providing original and high-quality 
submissions related, but not limited, to one or more of the following 
topics:
  * Machine learning in image filtering
  * Machine learning in image restoration
  * Machine learning in edge detection
  * Machine learning in image feature extraction
  * Machine learning in image segmentation
  * Machine learning in image compression
  * Machine learning driven by imaging applications.

Moreover, since image databases created for benchmarking or for training 
are crucial for progress in both machine learning and image processing 
fields, the evaluation of the submitted papers will take that aspect 
into account (accessibility, quality, reproducibility) and the 
performance evaluation has to be carefully adressed.

Authors should follow the EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal 
Processing manuscript format described at the journal site 
http://www.hindawi.com/journals/asp/. Prospective authors should submit 
an electronic copy of their complete manuscript through the journal 
Manuscript Tracking System at http://www.hindawi.com/mts/ according to 
the following timetable:
