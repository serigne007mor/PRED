Call for workshops

The 19th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
May 19-22, 2015, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam

Conference Website:
http://pakdd2015.pakdd.org/

The Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) =
is a leading international conference in the areas of data mining and knowl=
edge discovery. It provides an international forum for researchers and indu=
stry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results, and=
 practical development experiences from all KDD related areas, including da=
ta mining, data warehousing, machine learning, databases, statistics, knowl=
edge acquisition and automatic scientific discovery, data visualization, ca=
usal induction and knowledge-based systems, etc.

PAKDD 2015 seeks workshop proposals on foundational and emerging topics in =
areas related to data mining. The PAKDD workshops provide an informal and v=
ibrant opportunity for researchers and industry practitioners to share thei=
r research positions, original research results and practical development e=
xperiences on specific challenges and emerging issues. The workshop topics =
should be focused and cohesive so that participants can benefit from intera=
ction with each other.

A possible (non-exhaustive) list of topics include:

Big data mining/platform
Foundational topics in data mining
Data mining and biology
Data mining and climate change
Data mining for financial applications
Data mining in social networks
Data mining for healthcare
Data mining for environmental sciences
Data mining on cloud computing
Data mining on specialized data types: structured, unstructured, semi-struc=
tured, streaming, spatial-temporal, text and noisy text, multimedia, etc.
Real life applications and success stories
Data mining for location-based social networks
Privacy aspects of data mining
Data mining for security
Data mining for e-Governance/ Open Data
Data mining for manufacturing
Data analysis and mining for smartphone/mobile devices
The organizers and chairs of the workshop shall have full control on the ca=
ll for papers, forming of program committees, review and selection of paper=
s as well as planning the workshop program. However, the program committee =
chairs are not allowed to submit papers to the workshops to ensure a fair r=
eview process. In addition, the chairs must include the following statement=
 in the workshop CFP: "Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the=
 paper is accepted, at least one author should attend the workshop to prese=
nt the paper. For no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a notifi=
cation." The registration fees for workshops will be determined by the conf=
erence (not the workshop itself). The fees will be paid to the conference, =
and the conference will provide workshop facilities including working notes=
 printing, meeting room, coffee break, lunch, proceedings, etc.

Each workshop will have a right to include its outstanding papers in a LNCS=
/LNAI post Proceedings of PAKDD Workshops published by Springer. Under the =
program, the workshop chair must organize a review committee to select the =
outstanding papers from the papers presented in the workshop. Based on the =
reviews, each selected paper should be further improved for the camera read=
y version. A detailed schedule of due dates for the paper selection and the=
 collection of the camera ready versions will be announced immediately afte=
r the workshop.

Prospective workshop organizers should send a proposal (maximum three pages=
) with the following sections to the PAKDD 2015 Workshop Co-Chairs.=20

Title and acronym of the workshop
Duration (full-day or half-day)
Objectives, scope, and contribution to the main conference
Names and contacts of key organizers and a tentative list of members of the=
 program committee,
Short bio of the organizers, along with links to their web pages.
Preliminary list of invited speakers (if any)

Short description on how the organizers plans to attract quality submissions
Expected numbers of papers, attendees, and preliminary workshop format.=20
