The 5th International Conference on Signal Image Technology and Internet Based
Systems (SITIS'09)
                                    November 29 - December 4, 2009
                                      Farah Kenzi Hotel
                                      Marrakech, Morocco
                                 http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/SITIS
                 In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP.fr, IFIP TC 2 WG 2.13, IEEE
################################################################################


The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to
represent, share and process information in various forms, ranging multimedia
data to traditional structured data and semi-structured data found in the web.
SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that increasingly play a key
role in connecting systems across network centric environments to allow
distributed computing and information sharing.

SITIS 2009 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on research
activities centered on the following tracks:

* The focus of the track "Information Management & Retrieval Technologies"
(IMRT) is on the emerging modeling, representation and retrieval techniques
that take into account the amount, type and diversity of information accessible
in distributed computing environment. The main topics include data semantics and
ontologies, semi-structure data management, spatial information systems,
multimedia databases, multimedia networking and qos, information retrieval and
search engine, information security, schema mapping and evolution, data
warehousing, social network, and applications.

* The track "Web-Based Information Technologies & Distributed Systems" (WITDS)
is devoted to emerging and novel concepts, architectures and methodologies for
creating an interconnected world in which information can be exchanged easily,
tasks can be processed collaboratively, and communities of users with similarly
interests can be formed while addressing security threats that are present more
than ever before.  The main topics include information system interoperability,
emergent semantics, agent-based systems, distributed and parallel information
management, grid, P2P, web-centric systems, web security and integrity issues.

* The track "Open Source Software Development and Solution" (OSSDS) focuses on
new software engineering method in distributed and large scaled environments,
strategies for promoting, adopting, and using Open Source Solutions and case
studies or success stories in specific domains. The main topics include
software engineering methods, users and communities' interactions, software
development platforms, open source developments and project management,
applications domain, case studies.

In addition to the above tracks, SITIS 2009 includes workshops. The final list
of workshop will be provided later.

Submission and publication
--------------------------
The conference will include keynote addresses, tutorials, and regular and
workshop sessions. SITIS 2009 invites submission of high quality and original
papers on the topics of the major tracks described below. All submitted papers
will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for technical merit,
originality, significance and relevance to track topics.

Papers must be up to 8 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication format. 
Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by
IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major indexes.

Important dates
