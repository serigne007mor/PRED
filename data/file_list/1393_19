The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital
EcoSystems (MEDES 2009)
Technically sponsored by both ACM SIGAPP and ACM SIGAPP.fr Chapter
with the cooperation of IFIP WG 2.6
http://sigappfr.acm.org/medes
October 27-30, 2009
Lyon - France

http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES/09/



Description and Objectives
---------------------------
In the world of the Internet, the rapid growth and exponential use of
digital medias leads to the emergence of virtual environments namely digital
ecosystems composed of multiple and independent entities such as
individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing one
or several missions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships
among them. The digital ecosystem exhibits self-organizing environments,
thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", in
which resources provided by each entity are properly
conserved, managed and used. The underlying resources mainly comprehend data
management, innovative services, computational intelligence and
self-organizing platforms. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital
ecosystems and their characteristics, they are highly complex to study and
design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources
will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative and value-creating. The
application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the
understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to
create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and
knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques,
models and methodologies for fields such as data management, web
technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artificial
intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the
establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems
(EDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia,
research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifold
challenges and issues related to resource management of Digital Ecosystems
and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to
this end. The conference seeks related original research papers, industrial
papers and proposals for demonstrations, and tutorials and workshops.

Topics
-------
We solicit original research and technical papers not published elsewhere.
The papers can be theoretical, practical and application oriented on the
following themes (but not limited to):

- Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure

Paper Submission
----------------
Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be
uploaded using the conference website.
Submissions should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that
fail to comply with length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be
peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. Selection criteria will include:
relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and
quality of presentation.
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging
positions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At
least one author should attend the conference to present the paper.
The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM
Digital Library.
