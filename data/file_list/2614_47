- Beyond Facts -
1st International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse 
Analysis
(KnOD)


Collocated with TheWebConf (WWW) 2021


April 19 - 23, Ljubljana (Slovenia)
https://knod2021.wordpress.com/


-- UPDATES -- We are happy to announce our two keynote speakers:

- Preslav Nakov (Qatar Computing Research Institute, Qatar), who will 
talk about "Detecting "Fake News" Before It Was Even Written, Media 
Literacy, and Flattening the Curve of the COVID-19 Infodemic"
- Daniel Schwabe (PUC-Rio, Brasil), who will talk about "Trust and 
Mis/Disinformation - a Dispute of Narratives"


Summary


Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to 
the availability of an abundance of online discourse data, such as 
claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and 
contexts (related events or entities). Discourse data constitutes a 
valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias 
reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting and is crucial 
as training/testing data for various NLP tasks. While knowledge graphs 
(KGs) promise to provide the key to a Web of structured information, 
they are mainly focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity, 
connection or temporal evolution of online discourse data. As opposed to 
facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly 
depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended 
meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly 
diverge across communities from computational social science, to 
argumentation mining, fact-checking, or viewpoint/stance detection.
This workshop aims at providing a forum for shared works on the 
modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web,  
strengthening the relations between the fields of natural language 
processing (NLP,, computational linguistics, semantic web, knowledge 
graphs, argument mining and modeling, social sciences/communication 
studies, web science and computational social sciences. It will address 
the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about 
discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, 
discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic 
studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web.

* Knowledge graphs and knowledge extraction techniques in the context of 
online discourse
* Computational fact-checking / truth discovery
