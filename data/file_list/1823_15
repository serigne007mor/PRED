*# SCOPE*

Tackling the complexity involved in developing truly complex, designed
systems
is a topic of intense research and development. System complexity has
drastically increased once software components were introduced in the form
of
embedded systems, controlling physical parts of the system, and has only
grown
in CPS, where the networking aspect of the systems and their environment ar=
e
also considered. The complexity faced when engineering CPS is mostly due to
the
plethora of cross-disciplinary design alternatives and inter-domain
interactions. To date, no unifying theory nor system design methods,
techniques,
or tools to design, analyze, and ultimately deploy CPS exist. Individual
(physical systems, software, network) engineering disciplines offer only
partial
solutions and are no match for the complexity observed in CPS.
Multi-Paradigm
Modeling (MPM) offers a foundational framework for gluing the several
disciplines together in a consistent way. The inherent complexity of CPS is
broken down into different levels of abstraction and views, each expressed
in
appropriate modeling formalisms. MPM offers processes and tools that can
combine, couple, and integrate each of the views that compose a system.

MPM encompasses many research topics - from language engineering (for DSLs,
including their (visual) syntax and semantics), to processes to support
multi-
view and multi-abstraction modeling, simulation for system analysis, and
deployment. The added complexity that CPS bring compared to embedded and
software-intensive systems requires to look at these new applications and
how
MPM techniques can be applied or adapted to them, tying together multiple
domains. Many remaining research questions require answers from researchers
in
different domains, as well as a unified effort from researchers that work o=
n
supporting techniques and technologies.

This workshop, the continuation of the successful MPM series of MoDELS
workshops, is aimed at furthering the state-of-the-art as well as defining
the
future directions of this emerging research area by bringing together world
experts in the field for an intense one-day workshop

*# TOPICS OF INTEREST (including, but not limited to)*

- Heterogeneous models: multi-domain and multi-physics modeling, multi-view
modeling, multi-abstraction modeling;

- Heterogeneity in modeling languages: "blended" textual/visual modeling,
modular design of modeling languages, the modeling/formal
analysis/simulation/synthesis of user interfaces;

- Multi-Paradigm Modeling techniques: model transformation, model
composition
and integration, modeling cross-domain interactions, model-based detection
of
unanticipated interactions in heterogeneous systems, (co-)simulation of
heterogeneous models, machine learning applied to the design of CPS or thei=
r
languages in an MPM context;

- Taxonomies and Catalogues of Multi-Paradigm Approaches.

- Applications of and experience with current MPM techniques, with a focus
on
Cyber-Physical Systems in domains such as automotive, aerospace,
manufacturing,

Contributions should clearly address the foundations of multi-paradigm
modeling
by demonstrating the use of models to achieve the stated objectives and
discuss
the benefits of explicit modeling

*# SUBMISSION PROCESS*

We accept three types of papers, submitted as PDF on EasyChair, with topics
related to one of the Workshop=E2=80=99s topic:

- Full research papers (10 pages) present a novel, innovative approach;
- Short papers (5 pages) present new ideas or early-stage research,
extensively
discuss the experiences of the researchers with an MPM approach or
demonstrate a
tool;
- Extended abstracts (1 page) for a =E2=80=9Clightning talk=E2=80=9D (possi=
bly accompanied
with
a Poster), i.e. a short, focused talk that can spark lively debate.

Submissions should be contributed via EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmpm4cps2020

Each submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the PC.

Accepted Research and Short papers will be published with the main
conference=E2=80=99s
workshop proceedings (Extended Abstracts will not be retained for
publications).
