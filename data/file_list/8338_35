***************************************************************************=
***************************************************
3rd International Workshop on Process-Aware Logistics Systems  PALS 2013
http://pals2013.cnam.fr/
  August 26th Beijing, China,

In conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Business Process M=
anagement BPM'2013
http://bpm2013.tsinghua.edu.cn/

***************************************************************************=
***************************************************

*** Important dates*
Deadline for workshop paper submission: 25 May 2013
Notification of acceptance: 25 June 2013
Camera-ready final submission: 23 July 2013
Workshop day: 26 August 2013


**** Aim and Scope
Basically, this workshop deals with problems related to the design and opti=
mization of logistics systems in various domains and from a business proces=
s management perspective. It is dedicated to exploring and mastering the to=
ols needed for operating, reconfiguring and, in general, making decisions w=
ithin logistics-based systems, in order to provide the customers and system=
 users with the greatest possible value.
The workshop should provide the participants with a good up-to-date perspec=
tive on the tools that are now available for modeling, and solving logistic=
s-oriented problems, on a large-scale, and with an emphasis on the business=
 process and information technology perspectives. It should be noted that o=
ur aim, in the long term, is for this workshop to serve as a bridge between=
 the business process research community and the logistics research communi=
ty. Our vision is that the business process models, which are used on a dai=
ly basis for making the decisions needed for operating and reconfiguring th=
e logistics systems, can naturally serve as the starting point for the prob=
lem formulations needed to optimize these logistics systems.

****Topics
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Modeling and verification of processes in logistics-based systems
Optimization of logistic processes
Collaborative logistics problems
Dynamic configuration of logistics processes
Compositional models for complex logistics
Risk assessment and performance evaluation for logistics
Negotiation procedures and formalisms, within the context of logistics syst=
ems
Management of processes in logistics-based systems
Value chain management
Integrated processes and logistics
Integral supply chain management
Information flow in international logistics
Streamlining processes to improve visibility and automation
Compositional models for complex logistics
Application domains: Information logistics, Logistics automation, Productio=
n logistics, Emergency logistics, Logistics outsourcing, etc...
