MODGRAPH

Probabilistic graphical models for integration of complex data and
discovery of causal models in biology

Satellite meeting of JOBIM'2009
Nantes, France

8 june 2009

University of Nantes - PolyTech'Nantes -
Computer Science Institute of Nantes-Atlantic (LINA)
UMR C.N.R.S. 6241


This meeting aims at providing an opportunity for researchers in
Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Biology and Mathematics, to meet
and discuss the use of probabilistic graphical models to tackle problems
in the fields of Biology and Medical Research. Probabilistic graphical
models offer an adapted framework to infer knowledge from data whose
part is uncertain. Regarding the causality concept, these models have
proven useful to exhibit data dependencies, as well as predicting
experiment designs. Thus, the graphical model formalism is naturally the
core of a flourishing research field.

During the meeting, conferences and talks will cover a range of recent
developments and works under development, as well as applications, in
relation with machine learning and statistical inference performed in
the graphical model framework used for biology or biomedical research.

key-words : complex data-mining, probabilistic graphical models,
bayesian networks, statistical inference, data analysis
