  Special Issue: Simulation for Crisis and Disaster Management

*Summary*

Computational simulation provides an inexpensive and time efficient 
means of carrying out what-if scenarios and studies into alternative 
strategies for a given situation. Furthermore, it enables investigations 
and predictions into how the complex dynamics of a real-world system are 
likely to be affected by changes to internal and/or external factors. 
Over the past two decades, the development and application of 
computational simulation models has been seen at a rapidly increasing 
rate in a wide range of domains. Crisis and Disaster Management (CDM) is 
one domain in which this has been witnessed, driven by the significant 
increase in the number of large-scale and unprecedented emergency 
situations, and the need to better manage them and lessen their impact. 
These include areas such as pandemics, forest fires, floods, fatal 
industrial injuries, and wide-scale population movements (e.g., refugees).

Computational simulation of natural and man-made crises and disasters 
offers opportunities to bring together stakeholders, including academics 
and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds, in the design and 
implementation of realistic models applicable to the various stages of 
the emergency management life cycle (preparation, response, mitigation 
and recovery). Such collaborative efforts have delivered great benefits 
via sophisticated computational simulation models. Indeed, these models 
have improved trustworthiness, usefulness, usability, and validity. 
Their application has seen a growing acceptance and relevance, thus 
leveraging their results to make a practical difference. Consequently, 
the simulation results produced can contribute to providing a sound 
basis for ‘better’ decisions regarding how to manage crises and disasters.

Questions of interest in this special issue include, but are not limited 
to, the following theoretical and applied questions for crisis and 
disaster management models:

  *

    How to incorporate realistic human behavior into CDM simulation models?

  *

    What methodologies can be used to develop models from real data? For
    example, by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to create
    realistic models of floods, forest fires, earthquakes, or
    evacuations; or by leveraging data from past disasters, field
    studies, or expert input, to identify relevant human behaviors.

  *

    How to improve the value of crisis and disaster simulators for
    decision-makers?

  *

    In which phases of the disaster management life-cycle (preparation,
    response, recovery and mitigation) can we use simulators?

  *

    What methods, techniques and approaches can be used in CDM
    simulation (e.g. agent-based, virtual reality, systems dynamics,
    participatory approaches)?

  *

    How to create hybrid CDM models by coupling modeling approaches
    (e.g., Agent-Based Models) with other tools (e.g., optimization,
    social media analytics)?

  *

    How to increase acceptability and trust in CDM simulation models?

  *

    How to combine micro (e.g. citizen behavior) and macro (e.g. crowd
    behavior, norms) level representations ? How do they influence each
    other? How do macro-level emerge from micro-level behaviors in the
    CDM context?

  *

    What kind of explanations and predictions can we draw from real CDM
    data?

  *

    How to validate CDM simulation models and deal with quality issues,
    such as robustness, scalability, efficiency, or reliability?

*The goal* of this special issue is to cover the breadth and depth of 
computer simulation for crisis response and management. Papers should 
address topical and real-world problems (e.g., pandemics, humanitarian 
crises, natural and man-made disasters) and should highlight the use of 
computer simulation for crisis situations. We welcome manuscripts that 
contribute to the questions of interest in the form of novel research 
methodologies, applications, reviews, or case studies. Papers should be 
up to a maximum of 15 pages (including references) and detail completed 
research, i.e. not work in progress.

*Instructions for Manuscript Preparation*

For manuscript formatting and other guidelines, please visit the Author 
Guidelines for SIMULATION page at

<https://journals.sagepub.com/author-instructions/SIM>

Manuscripts should be prepared and submitted online at 
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/simulation 
<https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/simulation>

*Please note in your online cover letter that the paper is submitted for 
the special issue of Simulation for Crisis and Disaster Management. *

*Note:* Manuscripts may have been previously published. However, 
submission to the special issue requires at least 30% new material, 
preferably in the area of methodology, results, and/or experiments. Each 
submitted manuscript must include title, names, authors' affiliations, 
postal and email addresses, and a list of keywords. For multiple author 
submission, please identify the corresponding author.
