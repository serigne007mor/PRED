Subject: [liste-egc] ESWC 2014 Call for Tutorials



** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Call for Tutorials ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-tutorials

ESWC 2014 invites tutorials that address the interests of its varied audience: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web researchers and practitioners that wish to learn new technologies, users of Semantic Web technologies, and representatives of government and funding agencies as well as potential private investors in Semantic Web technologies. We welcome submissions of tutorial proposals on all major topics related to semantic technologies.

We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:

- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new semantic technologies and trends.
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in specific domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce, cultural heritage, etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research especially in relationship to the tracks of the conference (e.g., techniques from social science, database techniques, NLP techniques etc.).

Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.

We advise having more than one presenter and no more than three, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the tutorial topic.

Tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects; however, we encourage organisers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The tutorials should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its relevance to the community.

Timeline for Tutorials
-----------
Proposals due: Nov 22, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Notification of acceptance: Dec 6, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial Web site due: Dec 16, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Camera-ready material due: Apr 25, 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial days: May 25 and May 26, 2014

Responsibilities
-----------
Organizers of accepted tutorials are responsible for preparing and maintaining a Web site that describes the tutorial and includes all relevant information. Organizers are also responsible for submitting the material for attendees (slide sets, additional teaching material, software installation and usage guides for practical hands-on sessions, etc.) to the Tutorial Chair. The ESWC 2014 Organizing Committee is responsible for providing publicity for the tutorials as part of the conference publicity activities, and on-site logistical support to the organizers and attendees. Tutorial attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.


General Information
-----------
Each tutorial will have one reduced registration fee (pre-conference days registration will be free i.e. one of the chairs will only have to pay the main conference fees).
In the interest of the overall quality of the conference, the Tutorial Chair reserves the right to merge tutorials and/or adjust the scope thereof in case a mimimum number of registrations is not reached by the early registration deadline.

Submission details
-----------
Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages, using an 11 pt font for the body of the text of the proposal and should contain the following information:

- Abstract (200 words maximum, for inclusion on the ESWC 2014 website).

- Tutorial description: More specifically, it should specify the objectives of the tutorial and relevance to ESWC 2014, include enough details on the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered and specify the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge. Appropriate references to the material to be covered by the tutorial must be included.

- Tutorial length. The tutorial can be full or half day (if the tutorial can be either length, please be sure to identify which material is included for each length).

- Specify other venues to which the tutorial or part thereof has or will be presented, in addition to explaining how the current tutorial differs from the other editions. Links to the slides of those tutorial editions should be included in the proposal.

- Brief professional biography of the presenter(s) indicating previous training and speaking experience (such as teaching and tutorial presentation).

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the tutorial programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the tutorial's fit to the conference. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal.

Submission
-----------
Submission will be through the Easychair system (please note that it is the same site to submit workshops and tutorials)  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials
