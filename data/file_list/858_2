Call for papers
Fifth International Conference
On
Concept Lattices and Their Applications
*
*Montpellier, France, October 24-26, 2007
conference Web-site http://www.lirmm.fr/cla07
*



Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a mathematical tool for analyzing data and
formally representing conceptual knowledge. FCA helps forming conceptual
structures from data. Such structures consist of units, which are formal
abstractions of concepts of human thought allowing meaningful and 
comprehensible
interpretation. FCA is a mathematical discipline whose features include:
* Visualizing inherent properties in data sets,
* Interactively exploring attributes of objects and their corresponding 
contexts, and
* Formally classifying systems based on relationships among objects and 
attributes through the concept of mathematical lattices.

As an aside, FCA mathematical settings have recently been shown to 
provide a
theoretical framework for the efficient resolution of many practical 
problems
from data mining, software engineering and information retrieval.
CLA is an international conference devoted to both theoretical and 
applicational
aspects of formal concept analysis (FCA). Papers in the above areas of 
interest
are solicited:
* foundations of FCA
* mathematical structures related to FCA (concept lattices, Galois 
connections, closure structures, attribute implications)
* algorithms for FCA
* relationship of FCA to other methods of data analysis (clustering, 
association rules, classification, etc.)
* visualization of data in FCA
* data for FCA (object-attribute data, preprocessing of data, conceptual 
scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.)
* applications of FCA (knowledge discovery, data mining, information 
retrieval, ontology, semantic web, etc.)
* Other related areas

All papers will be judged based on their technical merits, originality, 
relevance to areas of interest of CLA 2007, and presentation clarity. 
Papers should describe original work that has not been published before, 
is not under review elsewhere, and will not be submitted elsewhere 
during CLA 2007's review period.

***Instructions for Authors
*Submitted papers must be no more than Twelve (12) pages, in English and 
should be and should be formatted according to the Springer-Verlag 
Lecture Notes in
Computer Science guidelines. Authors instructions and style files can be 
downloaded at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. All 
submissions
should be made via the paper submission interface (url to be communicated)
