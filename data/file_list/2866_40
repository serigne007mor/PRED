d be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to the chosen area, but i=
t should also cover the most important topics in depth=2E Each tutorial sho=
uld be well-focused so that its content can be covered in a half-day slot=
=2E Proposals that exclusively focus on the presenter&rsquo;s own work or c=
ommercial demonstrations are strongly discouraged=2E Tutorial slides will b=
e made available online at the ECML-PKDD website, although authors can prov=
ide them on additional websites as well=2E We offer a waived registration f=
