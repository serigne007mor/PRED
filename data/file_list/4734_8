Web2Touch 2020: Semantic Technologies for Smart Information Sharing
and Web Collaboration
http://web2touch2020.gear.host/

Conference Track @ 29th IEEE WETICE 2020
Basque Coast - Bayonne, France, June 10-12, 2020
===================================================================


<<<< CALL FOR PAPERS >>>>
Objectives
==========

Web2Touch (W2T), since its early days, is committed to bringing 
solutions for
collaborative work using the Web. New advances in Web-based systems are the
driver for changes in cooperative activities, such as risk and cybersystems
management, or smart environments, where human activities are more and more
performed via the internet and the Web. Web practitioners, users and
applications exploit, in rapidly varying ways, the richness of the Web to
support the user activities. Based on these considerations, the Web2Touch
track tackles knowledge and data sharing based on software engineering, on
artificial intelligence, and on methods for Knowledge Organization Systems
(KOS) (e.g. ontologies, taxonomies, etc.). The focus of the track is on
information creation, maintenance, disambiguation, interlinking, 
veracity and
security. Reasoning and deep learning techniques are also considered, since
these lead to better decisions or awareness of events. W2T deepens the
concept of "working together" by exploring decision support assistance,
collective intelligence, semantic search, smart environments,
intentions-based analysis, and other collaborative-based ways for problem
solving. W2T aims at exploring the state-of-the-art on these topics and
users' practical experiences, as well as trends and research, paving the way
for future collaborative approaches to knowledge engineering and sharing.

In the previous editions of W2T, which started in 2007, best papers were
published in International Journals, such as Journal of Web Portals 
(2011 and
2013), Concurrency and Computation and Collaborative Enterprise (2013),
Future Generation Computer Systems (2015 and 2016), and Springer Nature
Computer Science (2019).


Topics Covered
==============

W2T concerns improvements obtained through enhanced organization
and management of knowledge. Examples are models and tools to represent
dynamic changes in shared information, smart (context-aware) Web
applications, and new domains of application of semantic techniques, such as
Industry 4.0, Big Data, social networks, Internet of Things,
enhanced connectivity, and mobile technologies. W2T is also about practical
experiences in both well established and emerging interdisciplinary
applications, including eHealth, smart cities, smart companies,
entertainment, eLearning, education, and digital agriculture. Contributions
addressing one or more of the following topics are expected:

+ Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs
- Ontology tools, ontology engineering, reuse and integration
- Knowledge Graph expansion, enrichment, and validation
- Knowledge and data quality assessment
- Data profiling and axiom discovery
- Knowledge and Data provenance
- Knowledge and Data veracity

+ Semantic sharing and collaborative knowledge management
- Data integration and interlinking from and across different sources 
and formats/
semantics including big Web data, linked open data, crowdsourced data, 
social
data, knowledge networks data
- Crowdsourcing techniques for semantic collaboration
- Use of semantics in mobile Web, wearable and edge computing, and 
cross-device
content management and delivery
- Semantic annotations, 'semantifying' collaborative Web sources and 
Semantic
technologies for Information Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL)

+ Collaborative semantic Web techniques and applications
- Experiences and best practices in semantic Web support for 
collaborative work
and business
- Semantic techniques for cultural progress and community involvement
- Collaborative semantic Web in interdisciplinary applications such as Web
science, eHealth, education, entertainment, smart environments, smart 
factories
in the Industry 4.0, and digital agriculture
- Privacy, security and safety in smart environments (cybersecurity
and risks in cybersystems)

+ Experiences analyzing publicly available datasets, such as: Computer 
Science
Education (e.g., Blackbox, Engage-csedu), MOOC (e.g., Coursera, EdX), 
Computer
Virology (e.g., Genoma, Drebin), Healthcare, Bioinformatics (e.g., Dream 
Challenges)
