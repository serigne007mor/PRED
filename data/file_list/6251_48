 Uncertainty and Imprecision on the Web of Data



 July 15-19, 2014
 Montpellier, France


 --
 Special Session at the
 15th International Conference on Information Processing and Management 
 of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems
 http://www.ipmu2014.univ-montp2.fr


 ****Submission deadline December 9, 2013****



 -----

 ***Short description***

 Phenomena related to uncertainty and imprecision are common on the Web 
 of Data. On the one hand, data published as linked open data are often 
 incomplete and of variable quality; we are frequently faced to dealing 
 with missing, imperfect, vague and imprecise data in many real-world 
 applications. On the other hand, often these data's meta-models are of 
 inherently uncertain or imprecise nature and dealing with these 
 resources requires a suitable framework. Although active research 
 addressing these issues has been conducted recently, handling 
 uncertainty and imprecision is still an open problem in the context of 
 the Web of Data.

 The goal of this special session is to bring together researchers 
 working in the field of imprecise/uncertain knowledge and data 
 management and interested in linked open data technologies. The session 
 will address problems related to handling imprecision and/or uncertainty 
 of data and ontologies in the processes of publishing, interconnecting 
 and querying data by following the Linked Data principles. Two major 
 (partly intersecting) communities are targeted: (1) the community 
 dealing with reasoning under uncertainty and (2) the community focusing 
 on knowledge discovery, data mining, data integration and information 
 retrieval when data are fuzzy, imperfect or imprecise.

 The topics of interest can be articulated along the following axes (the 
 list being non-exhaustive):

 * Fuzzy ontological languages
 * Linking of imperfect/imprecise/vague data
 * Representaion of uncertain links
 * Fuzzy/probabilistic/approximate ontology matching
 * Reasoning techniques under uncertainty and fuzziness
 * Imprecision and uncertainty in specific domains, e.g.:
       - the biological and bio-medical domains
       - the geo-spatial domain
       - trust, provenance and security
       - multimedia
       - multilingualism
 * Quality of open data
 * Fuzzy data mining and knowledge extraction
 * Querying warehouses opened on the web: imprecise queries and 
 approximate answers


 ***Submissions***

 Contributions to the special session can be made in terms of papers 
 which will undergo the standard reviewing process of the IPMU 2014 
 conference. Complete information regarding the  submission process can 
 be found at the conference website: http://www.ipmu2014.univ-montp2.fr. 
 The accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference.
