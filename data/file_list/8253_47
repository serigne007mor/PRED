Dear Colleague,

We would like to cordially invite you to submit a paper for the special
session on

Multiple-Data and Intensive Learning

Special Session at IJCNN 2013

https://sites.google.com/site/mdimijcnn2013/

Fairmont Hotel . Dallas, TX

August 4--9, 2013

http://www.ijcnn2013.org/

organized within International Joint Conference on Neural Networks
sponsored jointly by INNS, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.  
The
session is supported by french group in "complex data mining" of EGC
society.

In many fields, such as multimedia, geographical information systems,
databases, bio-informatics,   and with advances in data collection and
storage technologies have allowed organizations to accumulate vast amounts
of data (Terabyte, Petabyte, and sometimes Zettabyte). Often the data come
from multiple sources such as sensors, data stream, web and  have different
distributions. Often, these data are stored and presented in such a way
that they are not supported by traditional machine learning algorithms.
Most existing learning algorithms are not suitable for massive data (Big
Data).

Most machine learning methods operate a small proportion of information
collected in their information system. Therefore, there is a growing need
to run learning  algorithms on very large and distributed datasets. Recent
trends in hardware have brought new challenges to the programming
community; multi-core and many-core systems have become ubiquitous. Data's
explosion involves that machine learning algorithms be parallelized and
distributed using the new parallelism paradigm. While the need for machine
learning is evident, few solutions exist today. Some learning algorithms
have migrated to the MapReduce programming model, that was designed to
simplify the processing of large data set. While MapReduce paradigms become
very popular, we believe they have a set of limitations making them
ill-suited to the implementation of parallel and distributed machine
learning. In order to discover knowledge it is necessary to explore data
efficiently by utilizing enormous computing power and by using new
paradigms of parallel and/or distributed  processing.

We invite submissions of papers describing original research addressing
multiple-data and intensive mining challenges in association with
parallelism or distributed model.

This includes but is not restricted to the following topics:

    Machine learning algorithms for Big Data
    Distributed clustering, biclustering
    Distributed ensemble classifier
    Distributed neural networks
    Parallel and distributed computational intelligence
    Multiple view  classifier/ clustering
    Supercomputing for big data mining
    Clustering, classification and fusion of multi-source, multimode and/or
distributed data
    Collaborative learning
    Learning with multiple imperfect (imprecise, uncertain, incomplete)
labelers and/or data
    Data privacy
    Crowd mining
    Data mining with cloud computing
    Compressive sampling, very high dimensional data analysis
    Future research challenges of data intensive mining

**Innovative intensive data mining approaches are welcome.
