Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Next Trends in Email (NextMail'11 - First
 International Workshop in conjunction with IEEE/WIC/ACM WI/IAT 2011,

are still research to be made around email]


                                  NextMail'11
            First International Workshop on Next Trends in Email

                        August 22, 2011 - Lyon, France


In conjunction with the 2011 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conferences 
on WEB INTELLIGENCE and INTELLIGENT AGENT TECHNOLOGY

CONTEXT
Is e-mail obsolete? As a matter of fact, we tend to gather more and more 
information in our inboxes: personal and professional communications, 
but also marketing and commercial ads, alerts and notifications from 
websites or social networks, search engines results, agendas, ... The 
current use also tends to widen: e-mail is not only used to fulfill 
inter-personal communication but also to exchange files, to gather RSS 
feeds or to pick up a date for a meeting. Many people rely on their 
inboxes to retrieve important information and to organize their daily work.

Do electronic messaging systems offer new solutions to answer these 
existing and future usages of e-mail? What will be the trends in e-mail 
software? E-mail solutions nowadays don't present huge differences with 
early ones : a 3-pane interface displaying email folders, a list of 
messages in chronological order and the content of the message currently 
selected.. Gmail was quite revolutionary with its new UI (thread list 
and thread view) and is considered as the major innovation lately. 
Social networks (Facebook) and broadcast medium (Twitter) enable to 
reach a broader audience while reducing unsolicited messages. Given this 
context, what will be the next innovations in e-mail software: Unified 
messaging system? Integration of tasks manager and agenda? Is e-mail 
really collaborative? And does e-mail solutions allow collaboration 
through e-mail? Can we (should we) share contacts, threads, encourage 
content sharing instead of exchanging files with e-mail?
Workshop Goals

This workshop aims at gathering the most relevant scientific and 
technical contributions, in order to enlighten the current key research 
on emails and to unveil some of the main upcoming trends. Scientific 
contributions either from core e-mail research or external fields are 
sought for, such as (but not limited to): IA (intelligent agents), NLP 
(email linguistic analysis), SNA (social network analysis), psychology 
(group interaction, graph communication analysis, ...), linguistic 
(stylistic changes from letter-writing to instant messaging jargon), 
human-computer interaction (user experience, design guidelines). As well 
as technical issues, efficient and emerging best practices based upon 
real life scenarii, user experience, security issues, legal archiving, 
new protocols may also be of interest. A comprehensive list of topics is 
available here.
