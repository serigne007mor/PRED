                     CALL FOR PAPERS

         The Twelfth International Symposium on
           Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2013)

          October 17-19, 2013, London, England

                   http://ida2013.org

FOCUS

When the IDA symposium series started in 1995, it focussed on the
problem of end-to-end intelligent support for data analysis. In 2010,
the IDA symposium re-focussed to support papers that go beyond
established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-changing"
ideas, whilst not always being as fully realised as papers submitted
to other conferences.

IDA 2013 continues this approach and seeks "first look" papers that
might elsewhere be considered preliminary but contain potentially high
impact research. The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to
ERA, is open to all kinds of modelling and analysis methods,
irrespective of discipline. It is expected to be an interdisciplinary
meeting that seeks abstractions that cut across domains.

FRONTIER PRIZE

In line with the theme of IDA, the IDA Frontier Prize will be
awarded to the most visionary contribution. Submissions considered for
this award must present novel and surprising approaches to data
analysis. Last years winners can be found at http://ida2013.org. The
award consists of a plaque and a prize of 1000 Euros.

Strongly related to the Frontier Prize: attendants of IDA 2013 will
learn about a project that may remind you of science fiction movies
like 'Minority Report': the prediction of crimes in Los Angeles. See
'plenary talks' for more details.

PLENARY TALKS

Along with the regular presentations, the conference schedule will
include exciting plenary talks:

- David Hand (Imperial College) on "Data not dogma: big data,
   open data, and the opportunities ahead" -- We have come a long way in
   intelligent data analysis, but we are still only on the foothills.

- George Mohler (Santa Clara Univ) on "Predictive Policing:
   Theory, Algorithms, and Practice" -- results on linking crime
   prediction to the allocation of police resources in Los Angeles.

- Tijl de Bie (Bristol Univ) on "Subjective Interestingness in
   exploratory data mining" -- a general mathematical framework for
   formalizing interestingness in a subjective manner.

CALL FOR PAPERS

IDA solicits papers on all aspects of intelligent data analysis,
including papers on intelligent support for modelling and analyzing
data from complex, dynamical systems. IDA 2013 particularly encourages
papers about:

- Novel applications of IDA techniques to complex systems
- Novel modes of data acquisition and integration
- Robustness and scalability issues of intelligent data analysis techniques
- Visualization and dissemination of results

Intelligent support for data analysis goes beyond the usual
algorithmic offerings in the literature. Papers about established
technology should offer novel ways to analyzing and/or modelling
complex systems to get accepted. The conventional reviewing process,
which favours incremental advances on established work, can discourage
the kinds of papers that IDA 2013 hopes to publish. The reviewing
process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate
papers against the stated goals of the symposium, and any paper for
which at least one program chair advisor writes an informed,
thoughtful, positive review will be accepted irrespective of other
reviews.

The proceedings of IDA 2013 will appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) series. For more details on submission and
review process, see the IDA webpage at http://ida2013.org or contact
the program chairs. News and updates will be posted on the IDA Twitter
account @ida_news.
