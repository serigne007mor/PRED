Subject: [liste-egc] CFP : Workshop-Discussion on Real-World Challenges for
 Data Stream Mining (RealStream)

----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------
Workshop-Discussion on

Real-World Challenges for Data Stream Mining (RealStream)

in conjunction with ECMLPKDD'13
September 27, 2013
Prague, Czech Republic
web:https://sites.google.com/site/realstream2013/
----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------

	Call for extended abstracts (up to 4 pages LNCS)

----------------------------------------------------------------

This workshop will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners
to discuss real-world challenges for data stream mining, identify
gaps between data streams research and meaningful applications,
as well as define new application-relevant research directions
for data stream mining.

Data streams, online learning and adaptation to concept drift
have become important research topics during the last decade.
Data arrives in a stream in real time and needs to be mined
in real time. In spite of the popularity of the research,
truly autonomous, self-maintaining, adaptive data mining systems
are rarely reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Workshop format
----------------------------------------------------------------

The focus of this workshop is on presentations and discussions
rather than on full written articles. Only extended abstracts
(up to 4 pages in Springer LNCS format) are required as
a submission and will be published in the online proceedings.
The submission of works-in-progress, industrial experiences,
as well as the presentation of works already published elsewhere
is strongly encouraged. Well articulated position papers are welcome.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Topics of Interest
----------------------------------------------------------------

We invite contributions focusing on real world challenges for
data stream mining. Topics include, but are not limited to:

= Challenges and lessons learned from mining real-world data streams
  -- Online data preparation and pre-processing
  -- Assessing reliability of incoming data
= Dealing with realistic data and workflows
  -- End user participation to varying degrees
  -- Interactive user feedback for adaptive learning
  -- Reliability / correctness of feedback
  -- Availability and delay of feedback
= Integrating expert knowledge into data stream models
  -- What to ask of an expert?
  -- When to ask? How to set the priorities?
= Moving from data stream algorithms towards data stream tools
  -- Improving usability and trust
  -- Developing autonomous, self-diagnosing data stream tools
= Scalability of data stream mining systems

----------------------------------------------------------------
Key dates
----------------------------------------------------------------

July 5, 2013: Extended abstract submission deadline
July 26, 2013: Notification of acceptance
August 9, 2013: Camera-ready deadline
September 27, 2013: Workshop date

----------------------------------------------------------------
Submission procedure
----------------------------------------------------------------

The submissions should follow the Springer LNCS format.
The submitted extended abstracts should not exceed 4 pages.
The extended abstracts are not necessarily required to present
original contributions; submissions partially or fully based on
already published works are allowed. The submission of works-in-progress,
industrial experiences, as well as the presentation of works already
published elsewhere is strongly encouraged. Well articulated position
papers are welcome.

Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors
to present the contribution at the workshop. Please indicate
in your submission which author will be presenting (e.g. by adding
a footnote to the author name). The authors are encouraged [optional]
to upload an up to 5 min. teaser-video summarising their talk e.g.
to youtube and include a link into their extended abstract submission.

The submissions should be made via the EasyChair Submission Site
(https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=realstream2013).

All submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee based on
relevance to real-world stream mining and potential interestingness
to the audience. Priority will be given to submissions including
evidence from real-world case-studies or participation of
a business or governmental entity.

The extended abstracts of the accepted talks will be published
in the informal online workshop proceedings.
