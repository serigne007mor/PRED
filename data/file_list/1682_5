>questions:
>Where does the data for collaborative decision making come from and how is
>it assembled?
>Who is, or should be, involved in making the decision?
>How do teams collaborate to build up common understanding?
>How to Tackle Complexity in decision making and decision support?
>A special focus on Data, Models and Actors will be taken into account.
>
