Bonjour


En relation avec le Projet de Classification Consensuelle (laur=E9at des
projets PARI port=E9 par Herman Akdag), le LIASD organise trois seminaires =
au
mois de mars (le 7 et le 8 mars):


"Towards reliable multi-agent systems: An adaptive replication mechanism"
par Zahia Guessoum (LIP6) le 7 Mars =E0 15h00 en A148.

R=E9sum=E9 :
Distributed cooperative applications are now increasingly being designed as
a set of autonomous entities, named agents, which interact and coordinate
(thus named a multi-agent system). Such applications are often very
dynamic: new agents can join or leave, they can change roles, strategies,
etc. This high dynamicity creates new challenges to the traditional
approaches of fault-tolerance. In this project, we will focus on crash
failures, with usual preventive approaches by replication. But, as
criticality of agents may evolve during the course of computation and
problem solving, static design is not appropriate. Thus we need to
dynamically and automatically identify the most critical agents and to
adapt their replication strategies (e.g., active or passive, number of
replicas), in order to maximize their reliability and their availability.
In this porject, we describe a prototype architecture, supporting adaptive
replication. We also discuss and compare various control strategies for
replication, one using agent roles, and another using inter-agent
dependences as types of information to infer and estimate criticality of
agents. Experiments and measurements are also reported.



"Classification in dynamic environments: methods and applications"
par Moamar SAYED-MOUCHAWEH (=E9cole des mines de Douai), =E0 10h30, le 8 Ma=
rs.

R=E9sum=E9: Dynamic systems assume different functioning modes in the cours=
e of
time. In statistical Pattern Recognition (PR), historical patterns about
system functioning modes are divided into groups of patterns, called
classes, using unsupervised learning method or human experience. These
patterns, with their class assignments, constitute the learning set. A
supervised learning method uses the learning set to build a classifier that
best separates the different classes in order to minimize the
misclassification error. The classification of patterns can be achieved
using membership functions which determine the membership value of a new
incoming pattern to a class. Patterns are static or dynamic. A static
pattern is represented by a point in the feature space. A dynamic pattern
is represented by a multidimensional trajectory in the feature space. In
this case, the feature space has an added dimension which is the time.
Classes can be also static or dynamic. Static classes are based on
stationary patterns. These classes are represented by restricted areas,
formed by similar patterns, in the feature space. Thus, the way in which
patterns arrive is irrelevant to their membership values. Therefore, the
classifier's parameters remain unchanged with the time. However, most of
data issued from the real world are non-stationary. In this case, classes
become dynamic and their characteristics change in the course of time.
Thus, the classes=92 membership functions must be adapted to take into
account these temporal changes. This requires an adaptive classifier with a
mechanism for adjusting its parameters over the time. In this presentation,
the principles of dynamic PR methods will be presented. Then, their
application to solve some of real world problems will be discussed to show
their interest according to the static classifiers.



"Classification =E0 base de SVM incr=E9mental et non incr=E9mental avec
applications dans le suivi de personnes et l'analyse d'activit=E9s humaines"
par Anthony FLEURY (=E9cole des mines de Douai), =E0 14h00 le 8 Mars.

Le r=E9sum=E9 de cette derni=E8re pr=E9sentation vous sera envoy=E9 lors de=
 la
prochaine annonce.





Comme d'habitude des affiches vous rappelleront ces =E9v=E8nements.

Bien cordialement
