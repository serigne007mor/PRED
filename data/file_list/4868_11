CALL FOR PAPERS

Elsevier - Online Social Networks and Media Journal
http://www.journals.elsevier.com/online-social-networks-and-media/

Special Issue on Dynamics ON and OF social networks and media

Submission Deadline: July 21st, 2019

******************************************************************************************************************
Manuscripts can be submitted continuously until the deadline. Once a 
paper is submitted the review process will start immediately and after 
(maximum) 4-5 weeks (as soon as the review process of that paper is 
completed) the authors will receive the first notification.
Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (in the 
first issue available as soon as the paper is accepted). All accepted 
papers will be listed together in an online virtual special issue 
published on the journal website.
******************************************************************************************************************

Online Social Networks and Media have a high scientific and economic 
value because the big data collected from these platforms provide a sort 
of social microscope to investigate and understand human behavior and 
interests, both in the cyber and in the physical world.

Network Science is a powerful approach to study the relations, 
interactions, and the organization of these socio-technical systems.
The analysis of network dynamics represents one of the biggest 
challenges emerged in recent years. Real-life networks cannot be 
considered anymore as static entities that we can pin to the wall and 
measure once and for all. They are, on the contrary, subject to several 
dynamic processes:

  * Dynamic ON the network. In this category fall all those phenomena
    that take place over a complex network structure and are constrained
    by it: examples are information propagation, epidemics, viral
    diffusion, word of mouth, etc.
  * Dynamic OF the network. As time goes by network topology may change,
    node and edges appear/vanish. Such perturbations, reflects the
    mutable interactions of relations between actors, of the evolution
    of the actors themselves.


This special issue seeks high-quality scientific articles (both 
theoretical and experimental) and survey papers focusing on using OSNEM 
data for the analysis of dynamics ON and OF networks.


Topics include, but are not limited to:

Diffusion of information
Evolutionary community/cluster discovery and tracking
Network event detection
Dynamic GNN / Graph embedding
Dynamic network visualization
Epidemic models on graphs
Higher order networks
Time-aware Link prediction
Dynamical processes on networks
Markovian dynamics on networks
Dynamic network generative models

Giulio Rossetti, ISTI-CNR, Italy
Remy Cazabet, University of Lyon, France


*** Instructions for submission ***

Manuscripts must not have been previously published nor currently under 
review by other journals or conferences. Papers previously published in 
conference proceedings are eligible for submission if the submitted 
manuscript is a substantial revision and extension of the conference 
version. In this case, authors should indicate the previous 
publication(s) in the cover letter and are also required to submit their 
published conference article(s) and a summary document explaining the 
enhancements made in the journal version.

The submission website for this journal is located at 
https://www.editorialmanager.com/osnem.
Please select “SI_NetworkDynamics” when you reach the "Article Type" 
step in the submission process. To ensure that all manuscripts are 
correctly identified, for consideration by the special issue, the 
authors should indicate in the cover letter that the manuscript has been 
submitted for the special issue on Dynamics ON and OF social networks 
and media.

For further information, please contact the guest editors at
