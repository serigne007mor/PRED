1. OVERVIEW

Information Systems are record sensitive and crucial data to support 
day-to-day company applications and decision making processes. 
Therefore, these systems often contain most of company product and 
process knowledge. Unfortunately, this knowledge is implicitly encoded 
within the semantics of the modelling languages used by the companies. 
The explicit semantics is usually not recorded in such models of 
information systems. References to ontologies could be considered as an 
added value for handling the explicit semantics carried by the concepts, 
data and instances of models Thus, developing new user Interfaces or 
reconciling data and/or models with external ones often require some 
kind of reverse engineering processes for making data semantic explicit.

Nowadays, ontologies are used for making explicit the meaning of 
information in several research and application domains. Ontologies are 
now used in a large spectrum of fields such as: Semantic Web, 
information integration, database design, e-Business, data warehousing, 
data mining, system interoperability, formal verification. They are also 
used to provide information system user knowledge-level interfaces. Over 
the last five year, a number of interactions between ontologies and 
information systems have emerged. New methods have been proposed to 
embed within database both ontologies and data, defining new 
ontology-based database. New languages were developed in order to 
facilitate exchange both ontology and data. Other languages dedicated 
for querying data at the ontological level were proposed (e.g., RQL, 
SOQA-QL, or OntOQL). Various approaches have been designed to deal with 
semantic integration of heterogeneous information sources and system 
interoperability using ontologies either in data sources or in 
mediators. In some domains, like products modelling, ontologies were 
published as standards. These ontologies are actually used to define 
world wide exchange consortiums for sharing information in various 
application domains. Due to these recent developments, most commercial 
database systems offer solution to both manage ontologies and data.


The objective of our workshop is to capitalize this effort. The aim of 
OAIS is twofold.
The first one is to present new and challenging issues in the 
contribution of ontologies for designing high quality information 
systems. The second one is to present new research and technological 
developments that use ontologies all over the life cycle of information 
systems.

4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Papers should be submitted in PDF or Word format.
Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should_*not 
exceed 10 pages*_ (including all text, figures, references and 
appendices) in the AISC format and must comply with the AISC formatting 
guidelines available at www.springer.com 
<http://www.springer.com/authors/book+authors?SGWID=0-154102-12-417900-0>.

Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, 
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Duplicate 
submissions are not allowed. A submission is considered to be a 
duplicate submission if it is submitted to other 
conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already accepted to be 
published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions 
thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require 
explicit consent from all listed authors.
