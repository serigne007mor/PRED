Subject: [liste-egc] KDD 2021 - Data Readiness Workshop CFP

Call for Workshop Papers

2nd=C2=A0International Workshop on Data Quality Assessment=C2=A0for Machi=
ne Learning

in conjunction with
The 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining=20
(KDD 2021)
Virtual event , August 14th-18th, 2021
http://data-readiness-kdd-2021.mybluemix.net

In the past decade, AI/ML technologies have become pervasive in academia=20
and industry, finding their utility in newer and challenging=20
applications. While there has been a focus to build better, smarter and=20
automated ML models little work has been done to systematically=20
understand the challenges in the data and assess its quality issues=20
before it is fed to an ML pipeline. Issues such as incorrect labels,=20
synonymous categories in a categorical variable, heterogeneity in=20
columns etc. which might go undetected by standard pre-processing=20
modules in these frameworks can lead to sub-optimal model performance.=20
Although, some systems are able to generate comprehensive reports with=20
details of the ML pipeline, a lack of insight and explainability w.r.t.=20
to the data quality issues leads to data scientists spending ~80% time=20
on data preparation before employing these AutoML solutions. This is why=20
data preparation has been called out as one of the most time-consuming=20
step in an AI lifecycle. Since the quality of data is not known at Step=20
0, when the data is acquired, data preparation becomes an iterative=20
debugging process and becomes more of an art, leveraging the experience=20
of a data scientist. Because the performance of an ML model is only as=20
good as the training data it sees, a systematic analysis of data quality=20
before building AI/ML models is of utmost importance.

The goal of this workshop is to attract researchers working in the=20
fields of data acquisition, data labeling, data quality, data=20
preparation and AutoML areas to understand how the data issues, their=20
detection and remediation will help towards building better models. With=20
a focus on different modalities such as structured data, time series=20
data, text data and graph data, this workshop invites researchers from=20
academia and industry to submit novel propositions for systematically=20
identifying and mitigating data issues for making data AI ready.

Topics:
Methods of data assessment can change depending on the modality of the=20
data. This workshop will invite submissions for data quality assessment=20
for different modalities: structured (or tabular) data, unstructured=20
(such as text, log, images) data, graph structured (relational, network)=20
data, time series data, spatiotemporal data etc. We would like to=20
explore state-of-the-art deep learning and AI concepts such as deep=20
reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, self-supervised learning,=20
capsule networks and adversarial learning to address the problems of=20
data assessment quality for ML. Following is a (non-exhaustive) list of=20
