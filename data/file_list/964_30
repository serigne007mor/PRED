Subject: [liste-egc] Post-doctoral Researcher position at the University of
 Orleans, France

HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLIED TO FINANCE

Mission

The HPIAF project is a two years project funded by EXQIM S.A.S. and is concerned
with the application of evolutionary computation to the production and
improvement of trading automata. The amount of data to be processed requires the
use of parallel architectures. The selected candidate is expected to study,
define, implement and evaluate the appropriate evolutionary algorithms and their
parameters, as well as design, implement, test and evaluate parallel versions of
the algorithms with predictable performance.
The post-doctoral researcher will work in close collaboration with LIFO's HPIAF
researchers (Pr F. Loulergue and Dr M. Bamha) and with EXQIM researchers who
have a long experience of industry-academia research collaboration. This
collaboration will involve sharing realistic datasets and parallel systems made
available by EXQIM, sharing and interfacing software libraries with EXQIM while
combining regular web-conferences with a moderate amount of travel to Paris
where EXQIM is based.

About EXQIM and LIFO

EXQIM - EXclusive Quantitative Investment Management is a company in the legal
form of a société par actions simplifiée (S.A.S.), registered under French law
since June 17, 2009, with a capital of €650,020. EXQIM has been approved by the
AMF since October 2010 as an asset management firm, and is to launch its first
fund in Luxembourg in the first quarter of 2011.
EXQIM's business objective is to generate returns for its funds using
proprietary investment strategies with an exclusively quantitative and
well-diversified approach.
The founding of EXQIM rests on the following observations:
- Machines do not make mistakes and are more efficient than human beings (faster
detection&  execution, no emotions).
- Technological innovations have opened new investment horizons.
EXQIM has three fundamental pillars:
- A department for applied financial mathematics research, which develops
arbitrage models;
- A department for computing research, development and exploitation, which is in
charge of implementing and monitoring trading automata;
- A department for operational control to ensure the management of risk and
post-processing.

The Computer Science laboratory of the University of Orleans (LIFO,
http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo) is a research and doctoral training unit
recognised and funded by the French Ministry of Research. The laboratory
specialises in software science. The Parallelism, Virtual Reality and
Verification group conducts research on parallel computing and verification and
hosts PC clusters for its experiments and for the benefit of its industrial
partners. This work has been rewarded by international, national and regional
grants. The group's techniques for scalable performance are applied to numerical
simulation, databases and machine learning. LIFO is a member of the Cascimodot
cluster federating Loire Valley-region laboratories involved in numerical
simulations.

Profile

The candidate must hold a doctorate in Computer Science with experience in some
of the following areas:
- genetic algorithms
- genetic programming
- machine learning
- parallel algorithms and applications
- parallel programming languages and applications.

The candidate must also be interested in producing high quality research reports
and software documentations.
Knowledge of French is not required but language courses can be made available.
