***********************************************************************
Goal
***********************************************************************

DS4EIW promotes and shares research and innovation on data science =
solutions with the final challenge to study, promote, and guarantee =
equality, inclusion, and well-being, significantly impacting society. =
This is an essential subject of debate in engineering and sociology, =
also involving governments, private and public companies, activists, and =
the press because discrimination and biases have to be avoided, =
stereotypes have to be removed, and well-being opportunities have to be =
designed and promoted.=20

The workshop aims to allow academics and practitioners from various =
research areas to share their experiences studying, analyzing, =
designing, and developing innovative methodologies centred on societal =
challenges to derive insights, characterize sociological phenomena, and =
support policymakers in promoting more inclusive reflexive and =
innovative societies.

Industrial implementations of explainable/transparent data algorithm =
applications, design and deployment experience reports on various issues =
raising data transparency projects, and avoiding bias and =
discrimination, are particularly welcome. We call for research and =
experience papers and demonstration proposals covering any aspect of =
data algorithmic transparency and accountability in real-life =
applications, fundamental properties to avoid bias and discrimination. =20=


***********************************************************************
Topics of interest
***********************************************************************
We invite the submission of high-quality manuscripts reporting relevant =
and work-in-progress research studies addressing various aspects of data =
science and analytic for equality, inclusion and well-being challenges. =
Contributions should be of interest to a large and varied =
cross-disciplinary audience of researchers and practitioners involved or =
interested from different perspectives in societal challenges. The =
workshop welcomes submissions of methodological, experimental, technical =
papers, application papers, and papers on experiences in real-life =
application settings addressing - though not limited to - the following =
topics:

- Concepts, methodologies, solutions for sensing, modeling, managing, =
mining, and understanding people behavior and activity
- Algorithmic accountability
- Explainable algorithms=20
- Data analytics and artificial intelligent algorithms
- Recommendations for people and analysts=20
- Recommendations for policymakers
- Intelligent systems to enhance user awareness of algorithm decisions
- Ethical issues of data collection, storage, and exchange
- Interactive query refinement and processing
- Innovative solutions for exploring, analyzing and visualizing data
- User-controlled algorithms for data integration, cleaning, and =
analysis
- Perception-aware data processing and analytics
- Database systems designed for highly interactive applications
- Crowd-powered data infrastructure.

In one of - though not limited to - the following application scenarios:
- Education=20
- Private and public employment
- Entrepreneurship
- Healthcare applications
- Public safety and security
- Citizens' mobility and transportation
- Urban economy and urban environments
- Data journalism
- Covid-19 pandemic
- Gender Equality Plan
- Inclusive Language
- Social services, unemployment and homelessness
- Economic, social and personal development
- Government transparency
- User-generated content (like tweets, micro-blog, check-ins, photos)

addressing - though not limited to - the following societal challenges:

+ Smart-working
+ Gender gap
+ Balance of life and work times
+ Special needs,=20
+ Ethnic and religious origin
+ Well-being

Topics aligned with the UN development goals: =
https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/

Diversity and Inclusion Statement
=
*************************************************************************
We support Diversity & Inclusion in the DS4EIW community therefore we =
kindly ask authors to adopt inclusive language in their papers and =
presentations
-- Inclusion and diversity in writing =
https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html
-- Tips for designing inclusive presentations =
https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivetalks.html =20

We also encourage women and underrepresented communities to submit =
papers on the research outcomes of their activity.
We will offer 2 free registrations to the event to female =
students/researchers or to people belonging to underrepresented =
communities to attend the workshop. The DW4EIW organizers will publish =
guidelines to apply for this support.

************************************************************************
Submission Guidelines
=
*************************************************************************
Submissions should present original results and substantial new work not =
currently under review or published elsewhere.

Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings =
Manuscript Formatting Guidelines (link to "formatting instructions" =
https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Please submit a full-length paper (from 5 pages up to 10 pages IEEE =
2-column format) through the online submission system =
(https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2023/bigdata23/scripts/ws_submit.php?subare=
a=3DS) after selecting Workshop 34 "Third International Workshop on Data =
science for equality, inclusion and well-being challenges (DS4EIW 2023)"

The workshop proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society.
