    Special Issue IADIS International Journal on Computer Science and
    Information Systems (IJCSIS)  <br>
    <br>
    <b>“Users and Information Systems”, an Interdisciplinarity journal
      issue </b><br>
    <b>Submission: 2 november 2010 </b><br>
    Web site: <b><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
        href="http://tinyurl.com/ijcsis-user-is">http://tinyurl.com/ijcsis-user-is</a></b> 
    or <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    To be fully adopted, every Information System (IS) should to be
    designed “by” and “for” end-users. Indeed, an IS must fit the users’
    needs, must help users to achieve information-related tasks, and
    must be compatible with resources and constraints implied by every
    user’s work situation. <br>
    <br>
    To do this, two trends can be identified: <br>
    &gt;    One is bottom-up: that is to say that it is a “standardized”
    IS, which relies on features and functionalities that allow it to be
    adapted to every user. It is based, for instance, on the user
    profile associated with a dynamic adaptation process. We can say
    that the system is adaptive. <br>
    &gt;    One is top-down: that means that it relies on cognitive
    analysis of users’ behavior, the way users make a decision, the way
    they select relevant information, the way that users share
    information with others in order to make the right decision, to
    design an IS taking into account these characteristics. We can say
    that in this case that the system is adapted. <br>
    <br>
    <b>The challenge of future works is to make these two approaches
      more deeply merged to make IS more adapted and adaptive to users.
    </b><br>
    <br>
    This special issue of the IADIS International Journal on Computer
    Science and Information Systems seeks original articles describing
    theoretical and practical methods and techniques that focus on the
    user’s tasks acceptance thanks to the adaptation capabilities of the
    IS. Typical contributions can consider user modeling (individuals or
    groups), tasks and behavior modeling as well as contexts modeling,
    to be integrated in Information Systems. The presentation of the
    design and exploitation of such models is central for this IADIS
    special issue. <br>
    <br>
    Topics relevant to this special issue include, but are not limited
    to, the following: <br>
    * Personalization, <br>
    * Adaptation, <br>
    * Recommender systems, <br>
    * Context modeling, <br>
    * Task modeling, <br>
    * User/Community modeling, <br>
    * Cognitive activity and processes in situation of work via a
    computed IS, <br>
    * Groupware, <br>
    * User-based Information System design method <br>
    <br>
    These topics can concern various contexts like: <br>
    * Virtual and dynamic documents, <br>
    * Information retrieval and access, <br>
    * Community of Practice, <br>
    * Hypermedia navigation, <br>
    * Social Networks, <br>
    * E-learning, <br>
    * Medical Information System, <br>
    * Virtual Identity,<br>
    * Web services <br>
    <br>
    <b>Note that every paper must tackle the way the user is integrated
      in the IS. Authors should try to discuss the way end-users
      appreciate the proposed IS (i.e. end users evaluations are
      encouraged). </b><br>
