Subject: [liste-egc] ECML/PKDD 2022 Tutorials & Workshops: call for
 proposals


*ECML/PKDD 2022 Tutorials & Workshops: call for proposals*


The ECML PKDD 2022 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials
and workshops to be held on the first and last days of the conference
(September 19th and 23rd) which will take place in Grenoble, France.
ECML PKDD (European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and
Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases) is Europe's top machine
learning and data mining conference, with over 19 years of successful
events and conferences around Europe.

Workshops provide an opportunity to discuss novel topics in a small and
interactive atmosphere. They can concentrate in-depth on research
topics, but can also be devoted to application domains or issues, or to
questions concerning the economic and social aspects of machine learning
and data mining. Multidisciplinary workshops that bring together
researchers and practitioners from different communities are
particularly welcome.

Tutorials are intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to
established or emerging research topics of interest to the machine
learning and data mining community.

For workshops, we solicit proposals for both full- and half-day in
current and emerging topics in machine learning and data mining.

For tutorials, we invite proposals for half-day. These topics include
related research fields or applications but also well-developed tools
and suites that support ML/DM research. The ideal tutorial should
attract a wide audience. It should be broad enough to provide a basic
introduction to the chosen area, but it should also cover the most
important topics in depth. Each tutorial should be well-focused so that
its content can be covered in a half-day slot. For relatively novel but
rapidly maturing topics, we encourage a format that combines a half day
tutorial (4h incl. one 30 minute break) followed by a half day workshop
(also 4h incl. one 30 minute break). Proposals that exclusively focus on
the presenterâ€™s own work or commercial demonstrations are strongly
discouraged.

We offer a waived registration fee for attendance of the main conference
to one speaker for each accepted tutorial, and, to one organizer or
invited speaker for each accepted workshop.

For more information and how to apply please refer to
https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/index.php/tutorials-workshops-proposals/

We are looking forward to your proposals.

Important dates

Workshop and Tutorials Proposal Deadline: 14 March 2022
Workshop and Tutorials Proposal acceptance Notification: 4 April 2022
