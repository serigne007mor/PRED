CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

BFAS Spring School on Belief Functions Theory and Applications

Carthage, Tunisia, May 20-24, 2013

http://www.bfasociety.org/

==================================================

The theory of belief functions represents a new approach devised to 
model and manage imprecise information in Artificial and Computational 
Intelligence. The theory of belief functions also referred to as 
evidence theory or Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by 
Arthur P. Dempster in the context of statistical inference, and was 
later developed by Glenn Shafer as a general framework for modeling 
epistemic uncertainty. These early contributions have been the starting 
points of many important developments, including the Transferable Belief 
Model and the Theory of Hints. The theory of belief functions is now 
well established as a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, 
and has well understood connections to other frameworks such as 
probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. The field 
of application of this theory is very large.

The second BFAS spring school will take place at IHEC in the historical 
and magnificent city of Carthage in Tunisia. The aim of this spring 
school is to promote this theory and to introduce interested students 
and researchers to the basics of belief functions, both theoretical and 
applied. The school is organized into several lectures given by 
international experts. They will bring both theoretical and practical 
backgrounds, in a friendly environment favoring interaction between 
participants. An important part of the time will be devoted to the 
resolution of proposed exercises concerning applied problems.
