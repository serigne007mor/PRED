Submissions accepted for the Demo track will be advertised on the ICSOC 
2019 website and would be included in the post-conference proceedings. 
Each Demo submission must consist of the following elements:

Paper (maximum 5 pages):

  * Pages 1-4 to describe the system to be demonstrated and the
    bibliographic references. The authors are encouraged to discuss the
    application domain, the problem scenario, the technology used, the
    techniques involved, the innovations of the system, interactive
    aspects, etc.
  * Page 5 provides the organizers with a list of requirements for the
    demo setting at the conference.
  * Papers must be prepared using the ICSOC format and submitted as PDF
    files. Submissions not conforming to the guidelines above will be
    rejected.

Video (maximum 5 minutes):

  * The paper should contain a URL linking to a demonstration video of
    no more than 5 minutes in duration (QuickTime or YouTube format)
    showing and explaining the execution of the system.
  * The video should be understandable without sound as much as
    possible, as they can be played during the conference.

Papers should be formatted according to the Springer’s LNCS Formatting 
Guidelines 
<http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=0-40209-0-0-0>. 
Submissions must be in English. All papers must be submitted 
electronically in PDF to the Demo Submission System 
<https://www.conftool.com/icsoc2019>.

All accepted papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings 
published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
(LNCS <http://www.springer.com/lncs>) series. Videos of accepted demo 
papers will be played (with no sound) during the breaks and demo 
sessions to increase visibility.

For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference 
and present the paper. The deadline for identifying and registering this 
individual author will be at the time when the camera-ready version is 
submitted.


    Selection Process

The submission and selection process for the ICSOC 2019 Demos will be 
separate from that of the main conference. Each submission will be 
assessed by the Demos Program Committee. The authors will receive a 
brief evaluation report with the notification. The evaluation criteria are:

  * Relevance to the ICSOC conference
  * Significance and originality
  * Video content and presentation
  * Maturity and readiness of the demonstration
  * Potential for public interaction
  * Potential impact in the intended application domain
  * Potential interest to a broader audience


    Demonstration Chairs

  * Walid Gaaloul, Telecom SudParis, France.
  * Qi Yu, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA.
  * Noura Faci, University of Lyon, France.
