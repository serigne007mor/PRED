Workshop at WSDM 2014, Crowne Plaza Times Square, New York City,=20
February 28, 2014

Scope
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The huge amount of data available in the Web in various forms (text,=20
images, videos etc.) raises challenging and difficult problems=20
concerning the extraction and assessment of useful information.=20
Intelligent systems for knowledge extraction are nowadays of utmost=20
importance due to the scale of the data in the Web. A key module for any=20
intelligent system is the capability of identifying and classifying=20
correctly data items in a pre-defined set of classes. In order to ease=20
the classification and organization of the data many real world systems=20
make use of taxonomies over the set of categories which are typically=20
organized in a hierarchical structure with parent-child relations.=20
Typical examples of such taxonomies are DMOZ, http://www.dmoz.org/, the=20
International Patent Classification,=20
http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ or Wikipedia.

In this context, new challenges arise on classification and clustering=20
problems, for web scale applications dealing with millions of=20
categories: data sparsity and class imbalance at different levels of the=20
hierarchy remain open issues for this setting; the class statistical=20
dependencies raise opportunities for new learning approaches;=20
controlling the classifier complexity or the inference budget becomes=20
critical.

The goal of this workshop is to discuss and assess recent research=20
focusing on classification and mining for Web-scale category systems. In=20
particular, we want to attract researchers developing new ways to=20
exploit such Web-scale systems, e.g. by exploring how different category=20
systems can be combined (through multi-task or transfer learning for=20
example) to improve classification accuracy or by exploring how=20
hierarchies can be refined or simplified for classification and mining=20
purposes. We also want to attract research work that reveals new=20
properties of large scale category systems, e.g. the type of data=20
distributions in large scale systems. The following topics are of=20
interest to the workshop (this list is not exhaustive):

  *  Semi-supervised learning for WSC
  *  Transfer learning for WSC
  *  Multi-task learning for WSC
  *  Deep learning approaches to WSC
  *  Clustering and hierarchy refinement
  *  Mining large scale hierarchical category systems
  *  Large scale classification for e-commerce
  *  Budget learning for large scale classification and clustering
  *  Parallel implementations of large scale classification and=20
clustering systems


Submmisions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Submissions must be written in English, following the ACM guidelines=20
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). We=20
encourage both long papers (6 pages max) as well as short papers (4=20
pages max) including references and figures. The Easychair electronic=20
submission system will be used for the papers=20

to the workshop page for details about the submission format and process.
