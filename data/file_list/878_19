International Workshop on Information Systems & Web Services
(WETICE 2007)
http://isws07.loria.fr/
Paris, June 18-20, 2007

Held at the 16th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies:
Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE-2007),
Institut National des Télécomunication
http://www.wetice.org/

Important dates
     . Workshop: June 18-20, 2007
     . Submission: March 4, 2007
     . Notification: April 23, 2007
     . Camera-ready: May 12, 2007

Context
Nowadays, evolution of enterprises is characterized by an aggressive
economic world-wide competition, and often, by an unforeseeable
environment in terms of needs and market demands. To survive in such  a
context, enterprises must collaborate, and they must be flexible  and
reactive enough to achieve this collaboration. In particular,  with
Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), a collaborative  application
application can be now considered as an assembly of  services, built on
composition of services, WfMS, and legacy  applications. Thus, the way a
business process is designed, executed,  and monitored is changing. A
business process can now be seen as a  set of composed services that are
shared across different business  units, organizations, or that can be
outsourced to partners. To  realize such business processes, a very
detailled comprehension and  integration of the information systems of
companies become necessary,  and classical problems of information
systems integration remain  important. These problems are very
complicated, due to the evolution  of information systems that became
even more complex and  heterogeneous. Technologies of the Web, and
precisely the concept of  Web services, promise to facilitate the
integration of applications  between companies by proposing
architectures and tools mitigating the  limits of the conventional
mediators (e.g., EAI). These technologies  constitute a promising
solution in order to meet the complex need for  integration and
urbanization of information systems. Indeed, Web  services make it
possible to publicly expose the functionalities of  an information
system, making it accessible through the Web  technologies that rely on
intensive use of standard interfaces and  protocols, reducing the
heterogeneity of the systems and providing  less expensive and simple
implementation solutions for achieving  integration.

Motivations
Currently, Web services tend to becoming a very active research field
grouping researchers of several communities: software engineering,
workflows, databases, information systems, multi-agents systems...
However, it is clear that the scientific literature treating of Web
services is far too dispersed. The result is that it does not exist a
clear unification and integration of the concepts, making very
difficult to have a full and synthetic understanding of this field.  The
goal of this workshop is to bring together the academic  researchers
around the topics around Web services, being focused more  particularly,
but not exclusively, on the role of this technology in  the emergence of
new approaches of design and integration of  information systems.

Topics
The objective of the workshop will be to support presentations and to
encourage in-depth discussions about both current state of research
efforts, and practical experiences. The list of topics includes (but
not limited to):
     . Web Information Systems,
     . Services composition,
     . Mediation, and transformation,
     . Discovery and dynamic selection,
     . Services mining,
     . Impact of Web services on modeling and design phases,
     . Worflows and Web services,
     . Semantic Web services,
     . Web services security/privacy,
     . Collaborative work and Web services,
     . Impact of Web services on organizations.
     . Workshop Format

The workshop solicits scientific papers that address problems  specific
to distributed and mobile collaboration environments.  Additionally,
position papers outlining interesting new research  domains and
approaches are welcome. The selection of papers is based  primarily on
their potential to influence future research.
The workshop will be a one day workshop, and the objective of the
workshop is to encourage both presentations and productive  discussions
around the topics covered by the accepted papers. An  invited keynote is
scheduled in order to set the focus of the workshop.

Submission
Papers should contain original contributions not published or  submitted
elsewhere, and references to related state-of-the-art work.  Authors of
accepted papers are expected to present their views of the  field at the
oral presentation. Papers up to six pages (including  figures, tables
and references) can be submitted. Papers should  follow the IEEE format,
which is single spaced, two columns, 10 pt  Times/Roman font. Papers
should include a title, the name and  affiliation of each author, an
abstract of up to 150 words and no  more than eight keywords. Authors
should also provide contact  addresses, if different from the submitting
electronic address. All  submissions should be electronic (in PDF) and
will be peer-reviewed  by a minimum of three program commitee members.

Formatting Instructions and templates are available at:
     . ftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/
IEEE_CS_Latex.zip
     . ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct.doc

Full papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the
proceedings, published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

The submission site is now open (http://www.easychair.org/ISWS07/).  You
first need to create an account on the EasyChair system in order  to
submit your paper. All submissions should be electronic in PDF  format.
