*1st International Workshop On*

*Ambient Data Integration
(ADI '08)
*
Monterrey, Mexico, Nov 9 - 14, 2008

 http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf

 * WORKSHOP THEME*

Nowadays, data integration has gained more attention and is one of the most
crucial tasks in complex applications. It is a legacy from independent,
uncoordinated threads of system development on one side. On the other side
it is a direct result of the tendency to integrate formerly separated data
sources since the value of integrated analysis has been recognized.

One of the challenging issues of data integration is to maintain consistent
mappings between source and target data schemata. Especially =96 and this
might become the normal case =96 this issue is gaining complexity when these
schemata are evolving and are geographically distributed over computerized
systems. In such complex settings, data integration solutions may exploit
background knowledge to match elements of the sources to the target. A kind
of background knowledge that is getting more and more important in emerging
data integration solutions is the notion of ontology. Often, the notion of
knowledge bases is tightly coupled with ontologies since the latter are
regarded as the conceptual backbone of the former. Especially since the
advent and the dissemination of ontology description languages like RDF(S)
and OWL ontologies are most relevant for data integration.

Conceptual modeling becomes more and more important for data integration but
surprisingly this relationship has not been studied in-depth by the research
community. However it is needed to build target schemata, e.g. databases and
ontologies. A special case of this approach is to build up local ontologies
=96 for applications to be integrated =96 and to derive from them integrate=
d,
shared ontologies. Without the proper and clean application of conceptual
modeling techniques neither local nor shared ontologies gain adequate
quality and expressiveness. In this workshop we want to focus on aspects
which are dominant for the success of data integration systems like
distribution and conceptualization.

This OTM workshop should bring together researchers and practitioners in the
field of data integration to exchange ideas of how to benefit from each
other's techniques experiences. We want to include conceptual, technical and
application-oriented solutions in the workshop program.

 *TOPICS OF INTEREST*

   - Application of conceptual modeling techniques for data integration;
   - Distributed and Peer to Peer data integration systems;
   - Ambient intelligence and data integration;
   - Cooperative data integration systems;
   - Data spaces and data integration;
   - Ontology-supported data integration systems;
   - Data integration under uncertainty;
   - Innovative underlying formalisms for data integration;

Applications, evaluations and implementations in the following domains are
of major interest:

   - Health care;
   - Life sciences;
   - Biodiversity informatics;

However, presentations of generally applicable concepts from any application
domain are also welcome.

*IMPORTANT DATES*

    Abstract Submission Deadline   June 15, 2008 Extended until June 22,
2008   Paper Submission Deadline June 30, 2008 Extended until July 7,
2008  Acceptance
Notification August 15, 2008  Camera Ready Due August 25, 2008  Registration
Due August 25, 2008  OTM Conferences November 9 - 14, 2008

*SUBMISSION GUIDELINES*

All submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality,
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of expression. All
submissions must be in English. Submissions should be in PDF format and must
not exceed 10 pages in the final camera-ready format. Detailed formatting
instructions can be found at:
 http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

The final proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag as LNCS . Failure
to commit to presentation at the conference automatically excludes a paper
from the proceedings.

Papers submitted to ADI'08 must not have been accepted for publication
elsewhere or be under review for another workshop or conference. Failure to
comply with the formatting instructions for submitted papers will lead to
the outright rejection of the paper without review.

The paper submission site is located at:
http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/adi/2008/papers/

*ORGANISATION OF THE WORKSHOP*

We plan to have an invited talk on the workshop's core topic. After that we
aim at 2-3 sessions with about 8-10 paper presentations. The workshop will
be concluded with a discussion forum which will be constituted by the
presenters of the papers. This panel will preferably be organized as a
so-called Advocatus Diaboli Forum in order to better stimulate discussion.

In order to establish a "common thread" throughout the workshop each
presenter will be asked to additionally provide his/her individual view on
the state of the art in data integration and especially on their experience
of the application of conceptual modeling techniques in that domain. To
share this experience is a very effective way to better shape a perspective
on the state of the art in data integration.
