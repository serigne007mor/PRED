#######################################################################
   Special Issue of the Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities
                                on
         HistoInformatics: Computational Approaches to History

              Submission Deadline: January 31st, 2020

       https://jdmdh.episciences.org/page/histoinformatics
#######################################################################

Traditionally, historical research is based on the hermeneutic 
investigation of preserved records and artifacts to provide a reliable 
account of the past and to discuss different hypotheses. Alongside this 
approach, historians have always been interested in translating primary 
sources into data and in using computational methods to analyze them. 
Nowadays, with the great wealth of digitized historical collections 
available, historians can greatly benefit from the advances of computer 
and information sciences techniques dedicated to the processing, 
organization, analysis, and interpretation of such data. In particular, 
these new computational techniques can help verify and validate 
historical assumptions.

Within this context, the special issue on HistoInformatics - 
Computational Approaches to History of the Journal of Data Mining and 
Digital Humanities (JDMDH) invites papers from a wide range of computer 
science topics which are of relevance for history, the cultural heritage 
sector and the digital humanities in general. We particularly invite 
submissions of original research papers on the following and related 
topics (but not limited to):

- Natural language processing and text analytics applied to historical 
documents
- Analysis of longitudinal document collections
- Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis
- Search and retrieval in document archives and historical collections, 
associative search
- Causal relationship discovery based on historical resources
- Named entity recognition and disambiguation
- Entity relationship extraction, detecting and resolving historical 
references in text
- Finding analogical entities over time
- Network Analysis
- Computational linguistics for old texts
- Analysis of language change over time
- Modelling the evolution of entities and relationships over time
- Automatic multimedia document dating
- Simulating and recreating the past course of actions, social 
relations, motivations, figurations
- Handling uncertain and fragmentary text and image data
- Mining Wikipedia for historical data
- OCR and transcription old texts
- Effective interfaces for searching, browsing or visualizing historical 
data collections
- Studies on collective memory
- Studying and modeling forgetting and remembering processes
- Estimating credibility of historical findings
- Epistemologies in the Humanities and Computer Science
- Computer Vision applied to historical image collections
