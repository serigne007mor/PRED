(IESM'07)
May 30, 2007 to June 2, 2007
Beijing, China.

Special Session on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases applied=
=20
to healthcare systems delivery

organized by Catherine COMBES and Fran=E7ois Jacquenet =96 Hubert Curien=20
Laboratory - UMR CNRS 5516 =96 University Jean Monnet of Saint-Etienne =96 =

Session description
Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) combines Data Warehousing/Databases=
=20
and techniques from data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition,=20
statistics=85 to automatically extract concepts and their interrelations an=
d=20
patterns of interest from large databases.
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) have been attracting=
=20
and the capabilities offered by KDD are becoming extremely important today=
=20
relating to the amounts of the data collected in various fields and more=20
particularly in healthcare systems delivery.
It is increasingly important to develop software tools to assist in the=20
extraction of information and knowledge from data, understanding the=20
implications of data in databases, and automatic construction of knowledge=
=20
bases from databases.
Contributions emphasizing recent advances and new research directions are=
=20
strongly encouraged. Submissions describing real case studies in healthcare=
=20
domain is recommended.
Recommended topics
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit complete original=20
papers dealing to healthcare domain with the following topics but are not=
=20
limited to:
- Data warehousing,
- Data collection and preparation,
- Data visualization techniques,
- Data cleaning, dimension reduction, discretization=85,
- Data mining techniques,
- Pre-processing and post-processing for data mining,
- Robust and scalable statistical methods,
- KDD framework and process,
- Database interfaces for efficient mining and visualization,
- Symbolic data analysis,
- Statistical approaches used in machine learning,
- Representing, modeling, and reasoning.
The application only concerns healthcare systems delivery.
