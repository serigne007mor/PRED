Presentation:

------------------

The TOTh conferences aim to bridge the gap between terminology and
ontology by highlighting the contributions that one makes to the other
and by opening up new perspectives for both theoretical and practical
developments.


Terminology is about names for concepts and objects in a given subject
area, but it is also concerned with other units such as collocations,
lexical combinations or phraseologies in actual use, all of which are
part of specialized languages and discourse. The terminologist=92s job
is to design and produce terminological resources which can be used
for a variety of language-based activities : translation, corpus
language planning, teaching language for special purposes, etc.


The quality and the precision of specialised discourse is directly
linked to the relation between the way lexical items are ordered and
the way knowledge is organised: sufficient encouragement in itself for
active collaboration between terminologists, translators,
lexicographers, knowledge engineers and IT specialists.


Terminology and ontology share similar objectives in the way they
approach and describe reality. Ontologies, which come from knowledge
engineering, are now one of the most promising ways to model
conceptual systems for terminologies. Of the numerous applications to
be found in the digital world, ontologies are particularly useful to
make terminologies operational and ensure their applications in
various roles : as translation tools, for information and knowledge
management, the semantic web, etc.


Terminology and ontology are both basically transdisciplinary in
approach, and both reach out to take on board practices and theories
from many different subject fields, in particular from linguistics,
language for special purposes, epistemology, artificial intelligence,
information sciences.




Target audience & Disciplines:

---------------------------------------


The TOTh conferences aim to bring together all those involved in LSP,
terminology and knowledge engineering and, more generally, all persons
interested in issues related to language and knowledge. They are
designed to be platforms of exchange and sharing where problems are
outlined and solutions and feedback provided, for both theoretical and
applied perspectives as well as for the new trends and perspectives of
associated disciplines: terminology, languages for special purposes,
linguistics, artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering,
information systems, collaborative engineering, information sciences,
documentation, etc.



Young Researcher Prize:

--------------------------------


Since 2011, a Young Researcher Prize is awarded by the Program
committee and bestowed on the winner during the Conference.



Conference topics (non exhaustive list):

 --------------------------------------------------



Linguistic approaches:


- language for special purposes, translation, language and terminology
planning, specialized multilingual communication,

- usage, variation, term collocations, lexical combination,

- terminological products: glossaries, dictionaries, thesauri,

- corpus processing and natural language processing: text mining,
extracting terms, extracting knowledge, corpus building, corpus
aligning,

-creating and maintaining terminological resources, harmonizing terms
and concepts, importance and limitations of corpora,

- theories of meaning, semantics,

- validating the quality of data, the role of experts.




 Knowledge representation:


- terminological principles for building conceptual systems,

- ontology and knowledge representation: representation, building,
maintaining, aligning, merging,

-classification theory,

-information retrieval,

-mono- and multilingual thesauri, library science, records management,

-input from artificial intelligence, linguistics, epistemology, formal
systems (description logic for example).




 Applications:


- software environments; building and maintaining terminologies,
thesauri, dictionaries, ontologies,

- IT applications based on knowledge and terminology resources:
semantic web, computer aided translation, mono and multilingual
content management systems, specialized digital libraries, information
retrieval, classification, knowledge management, information systems,

- assessing acquisition and manipulation tools, standards in the field
of language and ontology resources.
