The Seventh Conference on Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems

29-30 August 2012 ## Montpellier, France

http://www.lirmm.fr/ecai2012

Deadline for submission of full papers: 6 March 2012

######################################################################
## INTRODUCTION
######################################################################

The PAIS 2012 Program Committee invites papers describing innovative
applications of AI techniques to real-world systems and problems for
the Technical Program of the 7th International Conference on the
Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems - a subconference of
the 20th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2012).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a central topic in contemporary
computing science.  The fruits of almost sixty years of AI research
have benefited application domains as disparate as industrial systems
control and medicine.  The milestone events in AI research are
increasingly regarded as milestones in scientific and technological
development: from the first chess playing program to defeat a reigning
world champion under standard chess tournament rules, via the first
robot to autonomously traverse 150 miles of rough terrain, to the
first computer program that beat humans in a quiz. Techniques,
concepts, and results developed under the banner of AI research have
proved to be of fundamental importance in areas such as medicine,
biology, economics, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and
engineering. And of course, AI remains a topic of perennial
fascination in popular culture.

Papers highlighting all aspects of the application of intelligent
systems technology are most welcome. Our aim is to provide a forum for
academic and industrial researchers and practitioners to share
experience and insights on the applicability, development and
deployment of intelligent systems. PAIS is the largest showcase in
Europe of real applications using AI technology and the ideal place to
meet with those working to make successful applications.

PAIS-2012/ECAI-2012 will be held in the vibrant and elegant city of
Montpellier, France. With excellent opportunities for sightseeing and
gastronomy, Montpellier promises to be a wonderful venue for a
memorable conference.

## IMPORTANT DATES
######################################################################

Paper submission deadline:
     Tuesday, 6 March 2012

Notification of acceptance/rejection:
     Monday, 21 May 2012

######################################################################
## SUBMISSION INFORMATION
######################################################################

Both long and short papers can be submitted.  Long papers must not
exceed *SIX* (6) pages in camera-ready format. Over-length submissions
will be rejected without review. Papers should be submitted using the
ECAI formatting style, to be available soon on the conference website
(this will be very close to previous ECAI styles). Each accepted paper
will be allocated six pages in the proceedings. Submission of short
papers, not exceeding *TWO* (2) pages in ECAI page format, is also
encouraged. Short papers are meant for highly promising but still
preliminary work. Short papers will be presented as a poster. Rejected
long papers will not be considered for poster presentation.

All submissions will be subject to peer review by the PAIS-2012
Programme Committee, and evaluated on the basis of: social relevance,
scientific and technological impact, originality, technical quality,
and quality of presentation.

Reviewing for PAIS-2012 will be double blind: reviewers will not be
presented with the identity of paper authors. To allow for double
blind review, author names in a submitted paper or poster should be
replaced by the unique tracking number assigned by the conference
website at the submission of an electronic abstract.  Authors should
avoid writing anything that makes their identity obvious in the text.
Submissions should be original, and in particular should not
previously have been formally published. (As a rule of thumb, any
publication venue with an ISBN or ISSN number counts as a formal
publication.) Submissions should not be submitted elsewhere during the
PAIS-2012 review phase.

The primary authors of submitted papers will be offered the
opportunity to respond to the reviewers before the final discussion
and decision phase.

The proceedings of the PAIS conference, together with those of the
main conference, and STAIRS, will be published online (as an open
access book) and USB sticks with the proceedings will be given to the
participants. The authors will be responsible for producing
camera-ready copies of papers, conforming to the ECAI-2012 formatting
guidelines for inclusion in the proceedings.  At least one author of
each accepted paper or poster is required to attend the conference to
present the contribution. Based on the recommendations made by the
reviewers and a separate award committee, one of the accepted long
papers will receive the *BEST PAIS PAPER AWARD*. In addition, there
will be a *BEST STUDENT PAIS PAPER AWARD* (first author should be a
student to qualify).
