======================================================

The goal of RCIS is to bring together scientists, researchers, engineers 
and practitioners from a wide range of information science fields and 
provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and dissemination. RCIS 2015 
will continue paying attention to traditional topics at the conference; 
in addition, the special theme of “Information is all around us” will 
play a special role this year.

RCIS welcomes submissions from a diverse spectrum of information 
science. The list of themes and topics includes, but is not limited to, 
the following themes and topics:

• Information Security and Risk User-Oriented Approaches
• Human-Computer Interaction
• Social Computing and Social Network Analysis
• User-Centred Approaches
• Collaborative Computing
Data and Information Management
• Databases and Information
• Information Search and Discovery
• Conceptual Modelling and Ontologies Business Process Management

main conference.


*SUBMISSION PROCESS*
Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review for 
other conferences or journals will not be considered for publication at 
RCIS 2015. Papers should be in English and must be associated to one of 
the following categories:

Technical solution papers present solutions that are novel or 
significantly improve existing solutions. A technical solution paper 
must include a preliminary validation of the proposed solution, and 
results must be stated clearly enough so that it is possible to validate 
them in later research. Maximum page count is 12.

Evaluation papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate 
proposed solutions through scientific means, i.e. by empirical studies, 
experiments, case studies, simulations, mathematical proofs, etc. The 
research method must be sound and appropriate. Maximum page count is 12.

Industrial practice and experience papers present problems or challenges 
encountered in practice, describe success or failure stories, or report 
on industrial practice. The practice must be clearly described and its 
context must be given. Maximum page count is 12.

Work in progress papers present relevant preliminary results that may 
not have been fully validated yet. The work presented should be advanced 
enough as to show its contribution and significance. Maximum page count 
is 6.

The submission site address is 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcis2015.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of 
them will register to the conference and present the paper. It is 
expected that at least one author will register for each accepted paper. 
Only papers that have been presented by their authors during the 
conference will be published as part of the IEEE Proceedings.

Authors of papers that obtain the highest scores in the reviewing 
process will be invited to submit an extended version to special issues 
of journals including the International Journal of Information System 
Modeling and Design (IGI).

Since papers will be submitted to IEEE for publication in IEEE Xplore 
digital library, paper submissions must be formatted using the IEEE 
2-column format 
(http://www.ieee.org/¬conferences_events/¬conferences/-publishing/¬templates.html). 
They should be limited to a number of pages as indicated above for each 
type of the submission and submitted in PDF format. Please use the IEEE 
PDF eXpress tool (http://www.pdf-express.org/) to convert your source 
file into an IEEE Xplore-compliant PDF file or to check if your own PDF 
file is IEEE Xplore-compliant. IEEE PDF eXpress is a free service to 
IEEE conferences, allowing their authors to make IEEE Xplore-compatible 
PDFs (conversion function) or to check PDFs that authors have made 
themselves for IEEE Xplore compatibility (PDF check function). The 
conference ID for the IEEE PDF eXpress tool will be provided soon on the 
RCIS 2015 web site. It is important to note that submitting a file to 
IEEE PDF eXpress is only for creation or checking of a compliant PDF 
file and does not work as a submission; you must still submit your final 
paper through the submission site indicated above. For more information 
about how to use IEEE PDF eXpress, please see 
http://rcis-conf.com/rcis2015/express.php.
