OVERVIEW

The amount of structured content published on the Web has been growing 
rapidly, making it possible to address increasingly complex information 
access tasks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large scale 
human-curated knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques 
that identify or extract information automatically from unstructured and 
semi-structured sources. Yet, the potential of rich document annotations 
cannot be fully realized when information needs are expressed only by 
short keyword queries. One main open research challenge, and 
opportunity, remains on the users’ side: how to encourage and allow 
searchers to articulate longer, semantically enriched queries? And, 
assuming users’ would be willing to provide additional details, what 
type of annotations would benefit retrieval systems the most?

The ESAIR workshop series aims to advance the general research agenda on 
this core problem. The eighth edition of ESAIR, with a renewed set of 
organizers, sets its focus on

applications. We invite presentations of prototype systems in a 
dedicated “Annotations in Action” demo track, in addition to the regular 
research and position paper contributions. The desired result of the 
workshop is a roadmap and research agenda that guides academic efforts 
and aligns them with industrial directions and developments.

SCOPE AND TOPICS

The Workshop will bring together researchers working with semantic 
annotations, its use cases, its sources, its users, and its use in DB, 
IR, KM, or Web research, and work together on a range of open questions:

By semantic annotations we refer to linguistic annotations (such as 
named entities, semantic classes or roles, etc.) as well as user 
annotations (such as micro-formats, RDF, tags, etc.). ESAIR’15 will 
continue, with a new generation of organizers, on the path set by the 
previous edition(s) of the workshop: clarifying the exact role of 
semantic annotations in supporting complex search tasks.

Annotations come in a variety of flavors (named entities, temporal 
information, geo-positional markers, semantic roles, sentiment, etc.) 
and there is a growing repertoire of tools and techniques available for 
extracting these annotations automatically from text. The question then 
presents itself: what, if anything, is missing? We seek to answer this 
question by focusing on applications that are rooted in specific, 
real-world use cases; we also provide a number of such use cases, as 
motivational examples.

Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

  * Applications and use cases
       * What are use cases that make obvious the need for semantic 
annotation of information?
       * What tasks cannot be solved by traditional (bag-of-words) 
retrieval approaches?
  * Annotations
       * What types of annotation are available and what is missing?
       * Are there crucial differences between human and 
machine-generated annotations?
       * How should we deal with the uncertainty of annotations?
  * User interfaces and interaction
       * How to aid users in articulating powerful queries (beyond a few 
keywords)?
       * How to present results and interact with users in an 
intelligible way?
  * Evaluation
       * How to evaluate semantic annotations (component-based vs. 
end-to-end)?

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We solicit regular research papers (4+ pages, with an expected mean of 6 
pages), position papers (2+1 pages), demo papers (4 pages), and 
resubmission of CIKM-rejected papers.

All submissions must be formatted according to the ACM SIG proceedings 
format (option 2).

The reviewing process is single-blind, so submissions do not need to be 
anonymized. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to 
present their work at the workshop.

Please submit your paper through the submission website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esair15

Regular and position papers

What’s a 2+1 page paper? We like short and focused contributions 
highlighting your main point, claim, observation, finding, experiment, 
project, etc, (roughly 2 pages of mainly text) but we also like clear 
tables, graphs, and full citations (that’s the “+1″ page). So your 
submission can up three pages, as long as max. 2 of them are narrative text.

  * Submission deadline: July 9, 2015
  * Acceptance notification: July 23, 2015
  * Camera-ready version: 7 Aug, 2015

Demo papers

We invite researchers and practitioners to present their innovative 
prototypes in a dedicated “Annotation in Action” demo track at the 
workshop. Demo submissions must be based on an implemented system that 
pursues one or more aspects relevant to the interest areas of the 
workshop. A Best Demonstration Award, $500 USD and a certificate, 
sponsored by Google, will be presented to the authors of the most 
outstanding demo at the workshop.

  * Submission deadline: July 24, 2015
  * Acceptance notification: July 31, 2015
  * Camera-ready version: 7 Aug, 2015

CIKM-rejected papers

Authors of papers submitted to the CIKM full and short paper tracks, but 
not accepted for publication in the main CIKM conference as a result of 
that reviewing process, are invited to submit their work for this 
workshop. The complete text and all scores of all of the reviews 
returned from the CIKM paper review process should be included, as an 
appendix to the re-submitted paper. Those reviews will be taken in to 
account when these papers are considered for workshop inclusion.

  * Submission deadline: July 8, 2015
  * Acceptance notification: July 23, 2015
  * Camera-ready version: 7 Aug, 2015
