SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading
them according to the instructions provided on the DMIN website via
http://www.dmin--2011.com/submission.htm . Please follow the
formatting and uploading instructions (different to practice at some
other WORLDCOMP'11 conferences).
Submissions must be uploaded by March 10, 2011. Papers must not have
been previously published or currently submitted for publication
elsewhere.

The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases
of contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference
programme committee will be charged to make the final decision
(accept/reject) - often, this would involve seeking help from
additional referees by using a double-blinded review process. In
addition, all papers whose authors included a member of the
conference program committee will be evaluated using the
double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical papers will
not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

All proceedings of WORLDCOMP will be published and indexed in:
Inspec / IET / The Institute for Engineering&  Technology,
DBLP / CS Bibliography, and others. The printed proceedings
will be available for distribution on site at the conference.

In addition to the publication of the proceedings, selected
authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their
papers for publication in a number of research books being
proposed/contracted with various publishers (such as, Springer,
Elsevier, ...) - these books would be composed after the
conference. Also, many chairs of sessions and workshops will
be forming journal special issues to be published after the
conference.

architecture, U. of California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler
(known as Father of Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known
as Father of Genetic Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster
(known as Father of Grid Computing; U. of Chicago&  ANL),

xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza (known as Father of Genetic
Programming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey (NIH Program
Director, U. of Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer,
U. of Southern California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director

An important mission of WORLDCOMP is 'Providing a unique platform
for a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars,
researchers, developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress
makes concerted effort to reach out to participants affiliated with
diverse entities (such as: universities, institutions, corporations,
government agencies, and research centers/labs) from all over the
world. The congress also attempts to connect participants from
institutions that have teaching as their main mission with those
who are affiliated with institutions that have research as their
main mission. The congress uses a quota system to achieve its
institution and geography diversity objectives.'

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of
affiliated research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into
a coordinated research meeting held in a common place at a common
time. This model facilitates communication among researchers in
different branches of computer science, computer engineering,
and applied computing. The Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary
and inter-disciplinary research initiatives; ie, facilitating
increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.


PROPOSAL FOR ORGANIZING SESSIONS/WORKSHOPS:

Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from
different authors (12 papers in the case of workshops). The
session chairs will be responsible for all aspects of their
sessions; including, soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ...
The names of session chairs will appear as Associate Editors
in the conference proceedings and on the cover of the books.

Proposals to organize sessions should include the following
information: name and address (+ email) of proposer, his/her
biography, title of session, a 100-word description of the
topic of the session, and a short description on how the
session will be advertised (in most cases, session proposers
solicit papers from colleagues and researchers whose work
is known to the session proposer).
Please email your session proposal to
special-session-chair@dmin--2011.com .
We would like to receive the session proposals as soon as possible,
the deadline is February 10, 2011.


NEWS:

Thanks to authors and speakers of last WORLDCOMP congress and members
of the editorial boards who informed us of the following good news:
According to 'Microsoft Academic Search' (a Microsoft initiative)
all tracks of WORLDCOMP are listed as worldwide 'Top-ranked
Conferences' (based on various metrics but mainly based on the
number of citations). You can access 'Microsoft Academic Search' and
specific information extracted from it (in reference to WORLDCOMP's
individual conferences' names/acronyms and tracks) from the link
