Subject: [liste-egc] Call for Tutorials - 10th ESWC 2013 - Semantics and Big
 Data - May 26-30, 2013 - Montpellier, France.

10th ESWC 2013 -- Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013. Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/

=3D=3D=3D=3D Call for Tutorials =3D=3D=3D=3D

ESWC 2013 invites tutorials that address the interests of its varied audien=
ce: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web researchers and practition=
ers that wish to learn new technologies, users of Semantic Web technologies=
, and representatives of government and funding agencies as well as potenti=
al private investors in Semantic Web technologies. We welcome submissions o=
f tutorial proposals on all major topics related to semantic technologies.

We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:

- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new semantic=
 technologies and trends.
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in specific=
 domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other research fields that are of re=
levance for Semantic Web research especially in relationship to the tracks =
of the conference (e.g., techniques from social science, database technique=
s, NLP techniques etc.).

Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.

We advise having more than one presenter and no more than three, preferably=
 from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the worksh=
op topic.

Tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects; however, we encourage =
organisers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The tutorial=
s should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its relevance =
to the community.=09

riate references to the material to be covered by the tutorial must be incl=
