Digital Earth is the name given to a concept used for “describing a 
virtual representation of the Earth that is geo-referenced and connected 
to the world’s digital knowledge archives”. A very large amount of data 
is produced to represent multiple facets of our planet. As a result of 
continuous developments and massive use of new information and 
communication technologies, there is a considerable increase in sources 
of geo-referenced data. In recent years, new scientific and 
technological advances in the fields of sensors networks, remote sensing 
systems, spatial data infrastructures, Web technologies and volunteer 
geographical systems have increased the availability of spatial 
information at different geographical scales. Advances in computing have 
also enabled scientists to develop complex models for simulating earth 
phenomena (e.g., global climate change) that produce a huge volume of 
data. All these information require effective storage methods, as well 
as designing effective integration and processing techniques. New 
database technologies must be invented to better represent the 
complexity of spatial data (e.g., uncertainty; complex structures), to 
guarantee the quality of integrated data and to process the huge amount 
of information available (e.g., use of spatial data warehouses; 
non-relational databases; processing of raster databases or continuous 
fields).

The purpose of this special issue is to present the latest advances in 
the field of spatial databases for digital earth (focusing on data 
storage, integration and processing). Various application areas can be 
presented (earth observation, geosciences, environment, agriculture, 
natural hazards, etc.). The main topics of the special issue will be:

- Databases for storing data produced from remote sensing systems
- Storage of data collected by sensors networks
- Spatial data query and aggregations in large infrastructures 
(relational databases, No SQL, etc.)
- Continuous fields and raster databases: representation, map algebra 
and performance issues
- Spatial data integration and Extraction-Transformation-Loading tools
- Efficient storage, integration and processing of volunteered 
geographic information
- Spatial data warehouses and Online Analytical Processing tools
- New spatial data standards and infrastructures
- Spatial data quality management and integrity constraints
- Spatial “big data”
- Spatial data storage in cloud computing
- Spatial databases of simulation results
- Digital earth data and ontologies
- Spatial data mining in digital earth data
- New conceptual, logical and physical spatial data representations
- New models for representing uncertain spatial data
- etc.


The paper submission deadline is: Sept. 30th, 2014. Authors will submit 
their manuscripts on-line (http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tjde20). 
Submission instructions will be provided shortly.
