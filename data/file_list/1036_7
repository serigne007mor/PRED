Merci de diffuser largement


On a FEDER European grant, the LISITE laboratory of ISEP is financing a=20
3-year PhD student in Software Engineering and Computer Science starting=20
if possible in September 2010. The PhD students will be involved in the=20
MCUBE collaborative research project, with the WebDyn, Cap2020 and=20
SolarNet industrial partners. See the research team=92s web site:=20
http://en.isep.fr/academic-research/rdi

Research Context

The MCUBE project consists of providing a generic M2M (Machine to=20
Machine) system for multimedia applications, i.e. involving sound and=20
image analysis. The goal is to use standard video and sound capture=20
devices for supervision applications in the Agricultural (Cap2020=20
partner) and Photovoltaic (SolarNet partner) domains. For example, image=20
analysis can be used to follow crops growth in the fields, or to check=20
the state of solar panels for maintenance. Sound analysis may be used to=20
count insects in the field, to detect intrusions in the plants, etc. The=20
MCUBE project will provide a service for finding and deploying such=20
algorithms on M2M gateways (WebDyn partner). It will have to take into=20
account typical M2M constraints, such as energy consumption,=20
communication bandwidth and cost, relatively small memory and disk=20
resources, etc. These environmental constraints may vary depending on=20
the deployment target and the system will need to take this variability=20
into account too.
In order to set up an operational platform, the PhD student will work=20
with the ISEP researchers in Software Engineering and Signal Processing.=20
A research engineer will also be allocated to the project for helping=20
with the implementation and the deployment of the solution.

The PhD student will also be teaching assistants in their fields of=20
competences.

PhD Topic: Real-time classification, storage and analysis of multimedia=20
data in M2M applications
This topic consists of studying how to build scalable and safe=20
multimedia M2M applications. The thesis will need to address the=20
access/query large and heterogeneous data storages and flows, including=20
multimedia data. The use of data warehouses and cloud computing for=20
scalability will be investigated. The student will be working in close=20
collaboration with another PhD student, which will be focusing on the=20
image and sound processing analysis. Software Engineering technique such=20
as generative programming, formal validation, and/or languages and=20
compilers will be investigated in order to provide a safe development=20
and deployment environment for the environment-aware multimedia algorithms.

Requirements

The candidates must have a strong background in Software Engineering and=20
Computer Science, and hold an MSc or equivalent diploma. Some experience=20
with research is a plus, especially for engineers. English writing=20
fluency is a must. English speaking fluency is necessary, especially if=20
the applicant does not speak French.

Application

Please send your resume and cover letters in English to Renaud Pawlak=20
(renaud.pawlak@isep.fr - http://perso.isep.fr/rpawlak/). A=20
recommendation letter from a professor is a plus.
