About this book
===============
Data mining analyzes large amounts of data to discover knowledge 
relevant to decision making. Typically, numerous pieces of knowledge are 
extracted by a data mining system and presented to a human user, who may 
be a decision-maker or a data-analyst. The user is confronted with the 
task of selecting the pieces of knowledge that are of the highest 
quality or interest according to his or her preferences. Since this 
selection is sometimes a daunting task, designing quality and 
interestingness measures has become an important challenge for data 
mining researchers in the last decade.

This volume presents the state of the art concerning quality and 
interestingness measures for data mining. The book summarizes recent 
developments and presents original research on this topic. The chapters 
include surveys, comparative studies of existing measures, proposals of 
new measures, simulations, and case studies. Both theoretical and 
applied chapters are included. Papers for this book were selected and 
reviewed for correctness and completeness by an international review 
committee.

Written for:
============
Researchers, engineers, graduate students in Computational Intelligence 
and Computer Science

Keywords:
=========
Computational Intelligence, Data Mining, Quality Measures
