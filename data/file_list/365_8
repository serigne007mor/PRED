Third International Conference on Human Centered Processes (HCP-2008)

         Delft, The Netherlands (June 9-12, 2008)
           http://wiki.decis.nl/publichcp2008/

HCP-2008 focuses on improving the performance of human and software
information processing systems collaboration. This focus involves topics
like: architectural requirements for such systems, cognition-based
approaches for awareness and decision support, context awareness and the
effect on learning, reasoning and decision making in both humans and
software agents, and the interaction and socially inspired process
models for such collaborating systems and techniques to support them.
HCP-2008 is a platform with a plenary interdisciplinary conference,
tutorials, workshops, doctoral colloquium, and poster and demo sessions
in order to foster a shared interest across disciplines and stimulate
within-discipline progress.

First main deadline: December 10, 2007
        (Conference submissions and workshop proposals due)
