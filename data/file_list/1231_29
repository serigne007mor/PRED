A one-year Research Fellow/Post-doc position on “Structure, Formation 
and Co-evolution of Social and Economic Networks”.

The successful candidate will be involved in an advanced research 
project dedicated to the Structure, Formation and Co-evolution of Social 
and Economic Networks funded by Université de Bordeaux. The project 
takes place as a joint collaboration between two research teams working 
on networks, one in the field of economics and one in the field of 
computer science. The successful candidate will work under the 
supervision of Nicolas Carayol, professor of economics, 
(nicolas.carayol@u-bordeaux4.fr) and in direct contact with Guy 
Melançon, Professor of Informatics, (guy.melancon@labri.fr). The two 
involved research laboratories are: GREThA, CNRS & Université Bordeaux 
IV Montesquieu (http://gretha.u-bordeaux4.fr/), and LaBRI, CNRS & 
Université Bordeaux 1 (http://www.labri.fr/).

The awarded candidate will be involved in multi-disciplinary and 
fundamental research residing mainly at the crossings of economics and 
computer science. Several directions of research may be followed 
depending on the goals and competences of the selected candidate. 
Applicants may consider using several data sets maintained at GREThA 
(such as co-invention networks, citation networks, financial/syndication 
networks, world trade networks…). The project offers a stimulating 
research environment to candidates interested in the analysis of network 
dynamics from a theoretical and numerical perspective.
Applicants should have completed (or being near to completion) a PhD in 
economics /business or in applied maths/computer science. A strong 
knowledge in (some) of the following topics shall be positively 
considered: economics of networks, graph theory, microeconomic 
modelling, econometrics and programming techniques (especially the C++ 
syntax so as to fully take advantage of the collaboration with the 
computer science team and the TULIP platform it maintains: 
http://tulip.labri.fr/). Preference will also be given to candidates 
that have demonstrated their abilities to carry out research at top 
international standards and to publish their results in international 
journals.

The position must start between 1st of July to 1st of November and will 
be granted for 12 months. Applications should be sent by the 15th of May 
2010 at the latest but earlier applications are much welcomed. 
Candidates should send a CV, a statement of research interests (max 600 
words), up to three selected publications or unpublished work and two 
names and email addresses of references to Nicolas Carayol (by email: 
nicolas.carayol@u-bordeaux4.fr).

Informal enquiries can be addressed to N. Carayol and to G. Mélançon 
(guy.melancon@labri.fr). The position will be awarded on the basis of 
qualifications and interviews (if necessary) which will be arranged 
early June 2010 (a decision will be made June 20th the latest). The 
basic proposed wage is 1850 euros (net of all charges), but it can be 
negotiated on the basis of the candidate competences.
