##############################
Introduction to GrC2011
##############################

Granular Computing (GrC) is a general computation theory for effectively using granules such
as classes, clusters, subsets, groups and intervals to build an efficient computational model for
complex applications with huge amounts of data, information and knowledge. Though the label
is relatively recent, the basic notions and principles of granular computing, though under
different names, have appeared in many related fields, such as information hiding in
programming, granularity in artificial intelligence, divide and conquer in theoretical computer
science, interval computing, cluster analysis, fuzzy and rough set theories, neutrosophic
computing, quotient space theory, belief functions, machine learning, databases, and many
others.
IEEE GrC 2011 will continue to address the issues related to Granular Computing and its
applications. IEEE GrC 2011 will provide researchers from universities, laboratories and industry
to present state-of-the-art research results and methodologies in theory and applications of
granular computing. The conference will also make it possible for researchers and developers
to highlight their new research directions and new interactions with novel computing models.
To broaden more impact on granular computing and its applications, IEEE GrC 2011 will focus
on currently important major research tracks such as neural networks, fuzzy systems,
evolutionary computation, rough sets, e-intelligence (Web intelligence, semantic Web, Web
informatics), bioinformatics, medical informatics, security, and data mining.
