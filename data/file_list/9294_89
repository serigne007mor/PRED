*Object*: Internship Master 2 / Engineer

*Place*: Paris Area, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, 
France (ETIS lab, MIDI team)

*Subject*: Trajectory mining among indoor moving objects

6 months internship from May to October 2015 - approx. 508€/month

http://www-etis.ensea.fr/tl_files/site-etis/docs-actu/stages/masters-2014-2015/stageMaster-ETIS-2015-Kotzinos.pdf

*Description*: During the last decade, outdoor moving objects and their 
trajectories' detection [2] have received a lot of attention and 
important research was conducted in this area, while very few studies 
were proposed on indoor moving objects [1]. However, it is very well 
known that people spend around 80% of their time in closed (indoor) 
spaces like malls, offices, privates homes, etc. Nowadays, with the 
development of indoor positioning systems, important amount of indoor 
data are ready to be analyzed.
The indoor specific context differs from the well known outdoor one by 
the following topological elements: (1) the existence of walls/other 
objects that stop the object in its movement, (2) but also the existence 
of doors that allow to the object to change its trajectory.
In this context, the objective of this internship is to first study the 
existing algorithms for trajectory mining in indoor and outdoor spaces, 
to provide a comparative analysis and to propose improvements. One way 
to go is also to investigate the possibility of adapting outdoor 
algorithms in the indoor context.

Knowledge in data mining techniques such as frequent itemset mining but 
not only, and programming skills (Java, etc.) are required.

*Supervision*:

-    Claudia Marinica, MCF, UCP

Applications (with CV and motivation letter) must be sent to
