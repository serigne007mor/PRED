Introduction: 

Over last two decades, web has grown from being a mostly text based medium for disseminating information to play an important role in all facets of our lives. Some of the exciting developments in recent years include ubiquitous e-commerce, explosion of multimedia that rivals radio and television, and social networking. This workshop aims to bring together researchers that are responding to these new developments with the application of data, text, and multimedia mining tools to solve the latest and forthcoming problems posed by the world wide web.  

Papers describing theoretical aspects, prototype systems, tools and techniques, applications, and surveys of existing work (position papers), as well as future directions are welcome. The topics may include but are not limited to the following list:

 

Web Mining: 

- Web Mining (Content, Usage, Structure and Log)

- Association Mining

- Uncertainty Reasoning 

- Search and Web Mining

- Web Summarization

- Web Personalization

- Web Advertising and Marketing

- Web Recommendation Systems

- Web Warehousing

- Web Harvesting / Web Farming

- Context Web Mining

- Web Query Mining

- Multimedia Web Mining

- Temporal Web Mining
