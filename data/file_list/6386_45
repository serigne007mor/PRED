=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The 13th International Conference on Software Engineering Research,
Management and Applications (SERA 2015) 2015 provides an international
forum where engineers, researchers, and advanced graduate students are
invited to present their experiences and their recent advances and latest
research results related to all aspects of software engineering research
and applications. The conference is structured to cover the complete
software lifecycle from design through deployment to maintenance and
evolution. SERA 2015 will include a high quality scientific program,
invited speakers, tutorials and workshops in conjunction with the
conference.
