Sorry for multiple postings

*IEEE International Workshop on Data Science Systems (DSS)**
**Sponsored by IEEE Big Data 2021**
**http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~dss/DSS/home.html**
*

*Scope*

Data Science has subsumed Big Data Analytics as an interdisciplinary 
endeavor, where the analyst uses diverse programming languages, 
libraries and tools to integrate, explore and build mathematical models 
on data, in a broad sense. Nowadays, there is a new trend building 
systems and novel approaches, which enable analysis on practically any 
kind of data: big or small, unstructured or structured, static or 
streaming, and so on. Data science has become the umbrella discipline to 
analyze data, going from detecting data quality problems, spending 
significant time on data pre-processing and ending up with some 
sophisticated Machine Learning model, like deep neural networks.

In the Data Science Systems (DSS) workshop we welcome interdisplinary 
research mixing programming languages, machine learning, database 
systems and high-performance computing. The DSS workshop will feature 
”systems” research to enable data science on big data (with large-scale 
parallel processing), but also ”medium scale” data (a powerful 
workstation with multicore CPUs). Specifically, we welcome papers that 
present algorithms, data structures, functions, language extensions, 
optimizations that work well in modern data science languages, 
especially Python, R and SQL. It is fair to say that modern analysts can 
tradeoff some performance for ease of programming, ease of use or 
flexibility. Advances in hardware are making the cloud more attractive 
for data pre-processing and a local machine preferred for number crunching.


*Important Dates*

  * Oct 11, 2021: paper submission(short, full)
  * Nov 5, 2021: Notification of paper acceptance
  * Nov 21, 2021: Camera-ready for accepted papers
  * Dec 15 -18, 2021: Workshop (date to be determined later)


*Topics*

Data quality diagnosis and repair, which can be tweaked and customized 
in DSS languages
Interoperability of diverse data pre-processing programs, working with 
different file formats
Querying relational and non-relational data, but outside database systems
Spliting processing between DSS languages and Big Data systems (e.g. R 
or Python runtime alone and PySpark in a cluster)
Extending data science languages with new operators and functions (e.g. 
like numpy)
Accelerating ML algorithms (statistical summarization, stochastic 
gradient descent)
Enabling database query functionality in data science languages (e.g. 
optimizing Pandas code)
Cross-language optimization (e.g. optimizing R bottlenecks with C/C++ code)
Splitting processing between data science languages and database 
languages (e.g. Python and SQL)
Novel parallel data processing architectures (e.g. combining parallel 
DBMSs, Hadoop and other distributed architectures)
Exploiting new-generation file systems beyond HDFS (HPC file systems)
Flexible, fast, well-defined interfaces to exchange big data (e.g. CSV, 
JSON files).
Exploiting HPC libraries like LAPACK and MKL in data science languages
Web interfaces for complex processing pipelines (e.g. JavaScript GUI, 
calling Python)
Benchmarks, understanding tradeoffs between time performance and ease of 
use (i.e. the fastest is not necessarily the best alternative)
Case studies, presenting technical details of a library or program that 
can be used by data analysts across several specialties (i.e. how it was 
programmed and deployed in some OS)
