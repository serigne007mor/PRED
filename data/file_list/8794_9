Bonjour,
Je vous fais suivre l'appel à soumissions pour une conférence que je 
recommande particulièrement à tous ceux intéressés par l'apprentissage 
sur les séquences mais pas que (arbres, graphes,...).
Cordialement,

12th International Conference on Grammatical Inference

                             ICGI 2014

       September 17-19, 2014, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

http://www.iip.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/icgi2014/

               FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

-------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE, LOCATION AND PROCEEDINGS
===============================

ICGI 2014 is the 12th edition of the International Conference on
Grammatical Inference, held every two years.

The conference will be held in Kyoto University; in Kyoto, Japan, from 
September 17-19, 2014.
Kyoto is one of the most beautiful and historic cities in the world.

The conference proceedings will be published with the JMLR Workshop
and Conference Proceedings series. (http://jmlr.org/proceedings/)


IMPORTANT DATES
===============

15 May 2014: Paper submission deadline
1 July 2014: Notification of acceptance
1 August 2014: Camera ready copy
17-19 September 2014: Conference

AREAS OF INTEREST
=================

The conference is on grammatical inference: the field of machine learning
applied to discrete combinatorial structures such as strings, trees or 
graphs.
The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and
discussion of original research papers on all aspects of
grammatical inference including, but not limited to:

   * Theoretical aspects of grammatical inference: learning
paradigms, learnability results, complexity of learning.

   * Efficient learning algorithms for language classes inside and
outside the Chomsky hierarchy. Learning tree and graph grammars.
Learning distributions over strings, trees or graphs.

   * Grammatical inference from strings or trees paired with semantics 
representations,
or learning by situated agents and robots.

   * Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to
grammar induction, including artificial neural networks, statistical
methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic approaches,
minimum description length, complexity-theoretic approaches,
heuristic methods, etc.

   * Novel approaches to grammatical inference: Induction by DNA
computing or quantum computing, evolutionary approaches, new
representation spaces, etc.

   * Successful applications of grammatical inference to tasks in
natural language processing such as unsupervised parsing, bioinformatics,
web interface design, robot navigation,
machine translation, pattern recognition, language acquisition, software 
engineering,
computational linguistics, spam and malware detection, cognitive
psychology, etc.

Historically the roots of grammatical inference have been in the
modelling of first language acquisition by human infants: we especially
invite submissions that address this theme, directly or indirectly.

AUTHOR GUIDELINES
=================

We invite two types of papers:

- Formal and/or technical papers describe original solutions
(theoretical, methodological or conceptual) in the field of
grammatical inference.
A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or problem
tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution
suggested and the benefits of the contribution.

- Exploratory papers can describe completely new research
positions or approaches. Open problems may be suggested,
current limits can be discussed.
In all cases rigour in presentation will be required. Such papers
must describe precisely the situation, problem, challenge
addressed and demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways of
reasoning, may be inadequate. The authors must rigorously present
their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness to
addressing the identified situation.

There are no restrictions on the domain of application as long as
the paper provides sufficient background information.

The conference proceedings will be published with The JMLR Workshop
and Conference Proceedings series.

CONFERENCE FORMAT
=================

The conference will include plenary and invited talks, possibly
software demonstrations and poster presentations of accepted
papers.



SUBMISSION OF PAPERS
====================

Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper which
represents original and previously unpublished work.
Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published
proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions should conform to the guidelines that will be found on
the conference webpage.

All papers should be submitted electronically by May 15, 2014;
the submission URL is:

https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=icgi2014


Papers must be submitted in pdf format. The use of LaTeX is
strongly encouraged. The users of Word may download a
conversion tool to produce a PDF file for submission.

The total length of the paper should not exceed 12 pages on A4 or
letter-size paper, and should be in single-column format using at
least 1 inch margins and 11-point font.

Each paper should contain title, authors and affiliation, mailing
address, a brief abstract describing the work and at least three
keywords which can describe the contents of the work.

BEST STUDENT PAPER PRIZE
========================

The best paper with a student as the lead and presenting author will
be awarded a free registration prize. Eligible papers should be
noted in the submission and accompanied by a brief letter of
support from the research advisor. It should be included in the
paper submission at the front page. Recipient of the prize will be
notified at the time of acceptance and the student will receive a
winner diploma during the conference.

Please do not hesitate to contact us at icgi2014@googlegroups.com 
<mailto:icgi2014@googlegroups.com>
or directly if you have questions.

We are looking forward to your submissions.
