CALL FOR PAPERS=20

The rapid development in information science and technology in general=20
and in growth complexity and volume of data in particular has=20
introduced new challenges for the research community. Many sources=20
produce data continuously. Examples include sensor networks, wireless=20
networks, radio frequency identification (RFID), health-care devices=20
and information systems, customer click streams, telephone records,=20
multimedia data, scientific data, sets of retail chain transactions,=20
etc. These sources are called data streams. A data stream is an=20
ordered sequence of instances that can be read only once or a small=20
number of times using limited computing and storage capabilities.=20
These sources of data are characterized by being open-ended, flowing=20
at high-speed, and generated by non stationary distributions.=20

TOPICS OF INTEREST=20
We are looking for original, unpublished work related to algorithms,=20
methods and applications on data streams. Topics include (but are not=20
restricted) to:=20

- Data Stream Models=20
- Languages for Stream Query=20
- Continuous Queries=20
- Clustering from Data Streams=20
- Decision Trees from Data Streams=20
- Association Rules from Data Streams=20
- Decision Rules from Data Streams=20
- Bayesian networks from Data Streams=20
- Feature Selection from Data Streams=20
- Visualization Techniques for Data Streams=20
- Incremental on-line Learning Algorithms=20
- Single-Pass Algorithms=20
- Temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal data mining=20
- Scalable Algorithms=20
- Real-Time and Real-World Applications using Stream data=20
- Distributed and Social Stream Mining=20

PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES=20
Papers should be submitted in PDF using the SAC 2014 conference=20
management system: http://www.softconf.com/d/sac2014/ . Authors=20
are invited to submit original papers in all topics related to=20
data streams. All papers should be submitted in ACM 2-column=20
camera ready format for publication in the symposium proceedings.=20
ACM SAC follows a double blind review process. Consequently, the=20
author(s) name(s) and address(s) must NOT appear in the body of=20
the submitted paper, and self-references should be in the third=20
person. This is to facilitate double blind review required by ACM.=20
All submitted papers must include the paper identification number=20
provided by the eCMS system when the paper is first registered.=20
The number must appear on the front page, above the title of the=20
paper. Each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo=20
a blind review process by at least three referees. The conference=20
proceedings will be published by ACM. The maximum number of pages=20
allowed for the final papers is 6 pages. There is a set of templates=20
to support the required paper format for a number of document=20
preparation systems at: http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html=
=20

For accepted papers, registration for the conference is required=20
and allows the paper to be printed in the conference proceedings.=20
An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is=20
a requirement for the paper to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital=20
library. No-show of scheduled papers will result in excluding the=20
papers from the ACM/IEEE digital library.=20

STUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION=20
Graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on=20
their research ideas are invited to submit original abstracts of=20
their research work in areas of experimental computing and application=20
development related to SAC 2014 Tracks. The SRC program is designed=20
to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange=20
ideas with researcher and practitioners in their areas of interest.=20
All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers=20
and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which=20
they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have the=20
opportunity to give poster and oral presentations of their work=20
and compete for three top wining places. The SRC committee will=20
evaluate and select First, Second, and Third place winners. The=20
winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP recognition certificates=20
during the conference banquet dinner. Authors of selected abstracts=20
are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award program for=20
support.=20

Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (minimum=20
of two pages; maximum of four pages) following the instructions=20
published at SAC 2014 website. Submission of the same abstract to=20
multiple tracks is not allowed. Submissions must address original and=20
unpublished research work related to a SAC track, with emphasis on the=20
innovation behind the research idea. The submission should address the=20
research problem being investigated, the proposed approach and research=20
methodology, and sample preliminary results of the work. In addition,=20
the abstract should reflect on the originality of the work, innovation=20
of the approach, and applicability of the results to real-world problems.=
