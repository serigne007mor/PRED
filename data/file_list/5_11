CALL FOR PAPERS

Third International Conference on Risks and
Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS 2008)
http://www.redcad.org/crisis2008/

October 28-30, 2008, Tozeur, Tunisia

The Internet has become essential for the exchange of information.
Many user groups from different backgrounds and with different
objectives depend on it to perform their daily tasks. Various
activities are carried out via the Internet: between companies (B2B),
between businesses and consumers (B2C), or between individuals who
create their own virtual communities.

Moreover, many companies are interconnecting their Information
Technologies systems, including SCADA (Supervisory Control And
Data Acquisition) systems, directly or indirectly to the Internet.
  At the same time, the use of the Internet is facing increasing
risks regarding safety, reliability, privacy and security, in
particular due to vulnerabilities induced by the increasing
complexity of Internet-related applications. Therefore, new
security and dependability mechanisms and techniques should be
deployed to achieve an assurance level acceptable for critical
domains such as transportation, health, defence, banking, critical
  infrastructures, etc.

In this context, dependability, security and privacy become a priority
that should be addressed by all actors in research, industry, services
and governments. These issues will be studied from different view
points: research results, practical experiment and deployment, applications
and case studies, etc. Different application domains are concerned:
telemedicine, e-government, e-learning, e-commerce, critical infrastructure=
s,
etc. CRiSIS=922008 will be a forum for the participants to broaden professi=
onal
contacts and for technical discussions on security and dependability issues.
