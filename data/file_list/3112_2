1. Call for Research papers
*******************************************
In this track of ISWC 2019, we are looking for novel and significant 
research contributions addressing theoretical, analytical and empirical 
aspects of the Semantic Web. While we welcome work that relates to the 
W3C Semantic Web recommendations (e.g., RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc.), we also 
encourage contributions to research at the intersection of Semantic Web 
and other scientific disciplines. Submissions to the research track 
should describe original, significant, and replicable research on the 
Semantic Web. All papers must include method evaluations that are 
rigorous, repeatable and reproducible. This will be one of the key paper 
reviewing criteria. We also strongly encourage papers that provide 
material such as data sets, source code, queries used to evaluate their 
approach, and/or live deployments. To comply with the double blind 
review policy we encourage the usage of non-personal storage spaces or 
the additional material facility available at submission time.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Database, information retrieval, information extraction, natural 
language processing and artificial intelligence techniques for the 
Semantic Web
* Knowledge representation and reasoning on the Web
* Knowledge graphs and deep semantics
* Machine learning and data mining methods for the Semantic Web
* Data mining and knowledge discovery in Linked data and ontologies
* Robust and scalable management of semantics and data on the Web and in 
Linked Data
* Processing and storage of semantic data on the blockchain
* Methods to investigate and catalogue semantic primitives used in 
ontology definitions
* Enabling access to ontologies and knowledge bases by rendering the 
knowledge in different modalities, e.g. as natural language text, 
explanatory video, interactive elements, etc.
* Languages, tools, and methodologies for representing and managing 
semantics and data on the Web
* Programming the Semantic Web
* Architectures and algorithms for extreme volume, heterogeneity, 
dynamicity, and decentralization of Semantic Web data
* Cleaning, quality assurance, and provenance of Semantic Web data, 
services, and processes
* Ontology-based data access and integration/exchange on the Web
* Ontology engineering and ontology patterns for the Web
* Ontology modularity, mapping, merging, and alignment for the Web
* Search, query, integration, and analysis on the Semantic Web
* Supporting multi-linguality in the Semantic Web
* Question answering over Linked Data and ontologies
* Information visualization and exploratory analysis methods for 
Semantic Web data

2. Call for In-use papers
*******************************************

The adoption of Semantic Web technologies has accelerated in recent 
years, where they are now deployed in a variety of real-world settings 
at a variety of scales. The In-Use Track at ISWC 2019 continues the 
tradition of demonstrating and learning from the increasing adoption of 
Semantic Web technologies by providing a forum for the community to 
explore the benefits and challenges of applying such technologies in 
concrete, practical use cases, beyond the research communities from 
which they originate, in contexts ranging from industry to government 
and science.

The In-Use Track thus seeks submissions describing applied and validated 
solutions such as software tools, systems or architectures that benefit 
from the use of Semantic Web technologies (including, but not limited 
to, technologies based on the Semantic Web standards). Importantly, 
submitted papers should provide convincing evidence of the use of the 
proposed application or tool by the target user group, preferably 
outside the group that conducted the development and, more broadly, 
outside the Semantic Web research community. A main focus of the 
submissions should be on the benefits of Semantic Web technologies for 
the intended use case, as well as (if relevant) the added challenges 
they introduce.

We welcome submissions that demonstrate the use of Semantic Web 
technologies such as those mentioned in the Call for Papers of the 
Research Track, and additionally cover one or more of the following topics:
* Applications in domain-specific areas (e.g., libraries, cultural 
heritage, healthcare, life sciences, engineering, smart manufacturing, 
smart cities, open government)
* Description and analysis of concrete and novel problems or use cases 
in a specific domain in which Semantic Web technologies were applied 
(this should be part of submissions presenting a concrete application)
* Descriptions of how Semantic Web resources (ontologies, datasets, 
software, standards, etc) are being used in practice
* Assessment of the Semantic Web technologies from diverse points of 
view, such as:
- Usability and acceptance by stakeholder groups
- Uptake outside the Semantic Web research community
- Scalability of Semantic Web solutions and their large scale deployment
- Technical strengths and weaknesses especially in comparison with 
alternative technologies (e.g., database management systems, 
model-driven engineering)
- Costs and benefits of implementing, deploying, using, and managing 
Semantic Web technologies
- Risks and opportunities of using Semantic Web technologies in 
organizations with respect to their businesses and customers
* Lessons learned and best practices from deploying and using an 
application or service based on Semantic Web technologies
* Comparison of Semantic Web technologies with alternative approaches 
that use conventional or competing technologies

3. Call for Resource papers
*******************************************
Resources are of paramount importance as they foster scientific 
advancement. For example, the DBpedia resource had a major influence on 
the Semantic Web community by enabling the Linked (Open) Data movement. 
Validating a research hypothesis or providing answers to a research 
question often goes together with developing new resources that support 
these achievements. Sharing resources is key to allow other researchers 
to compare new results, reproduce experimental settings and explore new 
lines of research, in accordance with the FAIR principles for scientific 
data management. Yet, resources themselves rarely get the same 
recognition as the scientific advances they facilitate.

The ISWC 2019 Resources Track aims to promote the sharing of resources 
including, but not restricted to: datasets, ontologies/vocabularies, 
ontology design patterns, evaluation benchmarks or methods, software 
tools/services, APIs and software frameworks, workflows, crowdsourcing 
task designs, protocols, methodologies and metrics, that contribute to 
the generation of novel scientific work. In particular, we encourage the 
sharing of such resources following best practices within the Semantic 
Web community. This track calls for contributions that provide a concise 
and clear description of a resource and its usage.

A typical Resource track paper has its focus set on reporting on one of 
the following categories of resources:
* Datasets produced
- to support specific evaluation tasks;
- to support novel research methods;
- by novel algorithms;
* Ontologies, vocabularies and ontology design patterns, with a focus on 
describing the modelling process and decisions underlying their creation;
* Benchmarking activities focusing on datasets and algorithms for 
comprehensible and systematic evaluation of existing and future systems;
* Reusable research prototypes / services supporting a given research 
hypothesis;
* Community-shared software frameworks that can be extended or adapted 
to support scientific study and experimentation;
* Scientific and experimental workflows used and reused in practical 
studies;
* Novel evaluation methodologies and metrics, and their demonstration in 
an experimental study.

4. Call for Doctoral Consortium Papers
**********************************************
The ISWC 2019 Doctoral Consortium will take place as part of the 18th 
International Semantic Web Conference in Auckland, New Zealand. This 
forum will provide PhD students an opportunity to share and develop 
their research ideas in a critical but supportive environment, to get 
feedback from mentors who are senior members of the Semantic Web 
research community, to explore issues related to academic and research 
careers, and to build relationships with other Semantic Web PhD students 
from around the world.
The Consortium aims to broaden the perspectives and to improve the 
research and communication skills of these students.
The Doctoral Consortium is intended for students who have a specific 
research proposal and some preliminary results, but who have sufficient 
time prior to completing their dissertation to benefit from the 
consortium experience. Generally, students in their second or third year 
of PhD will benefit the most from the Doctoral Consortium. In the 
Consortium, the students will present their proposals and get specific 
feedback and advice on how to improve their research plan.
All proposals submitted to the Doctoral Consortium will undergo a 
thorough reviewing process with a view to providing detailed and 
constructive feedback. The international program committee will select - 
submissions for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium.
Students with accepted submissions at the Doctoral Consortium will be 
eligible to apply for travel fellowships to offset some of the travel 
costs but they will be asked to attend the whole day of the Doctoral 
Consortium.
We ask the PhD students to submit a 12 page description of their PhD 
research proposal. All proposal have to be submitted electronically via 
the EasyChair conference submission System. The proposal text must have 
at least 8 sections (some can be very short), addressing each of the 
following questions:
1. Problem statement: What is the problem that you are addressing?
2. Relevancy: Why is the problem important? Who will benefit if you 
succeed? Who should care?
3. Related work: How have others attempted to address this problem? Why 
is the problem difficult?
4. Research question(s): What are the research questions that you plan 
to address?
5. Hypotheses: What hypotheses are related to your research questions? 
See Is This Really Science? The Semantic Webber’s Guide to Evaluating 
Research Contributions.
6. Preliminary results: Do you have any preliminary results that 
demonstrate that your approach is promising?
7. Approach: How are you planning to address your research questions and 
test your hypotheses? What is the main idea behind your approach? The 
key innovation?
8. Evaluation plan: How will you measure your success – faster/ more 
accurate/ less failures/ etc.? How do you plan to test your hypothesis? 
What will you measure? What will you compare to?
9. Reflections: Why do you think you will succeed where others failed? 
Provide an argument, based either on common knowledge or on evidence 
that you have accumulated, that your approach is likely to succeed.
