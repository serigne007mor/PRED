  == *Post-doctoral position in machine learning applied to remote 
sensing images* ==

LSIIT - University of Strasbourg, France

The FOSTER project http://foster.univ-nc.nc aims at building, from the 
available data, dynamic models to support monitoring and studying the 
evolution of the environment, actually the erosion. Data consist of 
satellite images, (symbolic and numerical) spatio-temporal data, and 
background knowledge. Those data are heterogeneous, multi-scale, noisy, 
and have missing values. They are large, for instance a satellite image 
and the associated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) need 26Gb.

The environmental processes are complex and we would like to learn 
several models, eg. sharp changes as well as monitoring slowly evolving 
phenomena. Studying dynamic systems evolving in space and time raises 
questions on the spatial relation and temporal evolutions to consider. 
The area studied in this project are located in New Caledonia (*) and 
French Alps.


The post-doctoral research fellow will contribute to the following tasks:
   - 1) complement the Samarah collaborative approach by integrating 
mecanisms to deal with spatio-temporal data and constraints/background 
knowledge. On the one hand, semi-supervised clustering techniques will 
be integrated. On the other hand, supervised/active learning techniques 
will be considered, in a complementary/collaborative approach.
   - 2) conceive and evaluate new multi-step collaborative methods for 
spatio-temporal data mining. One important research issue concerns the 
back-propagation of information through learning processes.


We look for a PhD with an experience in data mining, and if possible in 
remote sensing.
The candidate will work with the Data Mining Group : 
http://lsiit-cnrs.unistra.fr/bfo-en/index.php/Data_Mining_and_classification
He/she would be able to dialog with geologists to validate methods and 
results.

/Duration: 1 year renewable once/
/Salary: around 2000 EUR net income
