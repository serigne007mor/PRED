The AIR project =
<https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/actualites/luniversite-de-rennes-1-laureate-d=
e-lami-demonstrateurs-numeriques-dans-lenseignement-superieur> from the =
University of Rennes 1, in collaboration with University of Rennes 2, =
Inria, INSA and industrial IT companies, is one of the few national =
funded research projects to study new digital forms for teaching. =
Specifically, the AIR project aims to develop innovative operational =
solutions to increase and enrich pedagogical interactions through =
digital means. Within this project, the MediCIS/LTSI team aims 1) to =
develop innovative virtual reality based simulators to help learning =
non-technical medical and surgical skills, 2) to study data driven =
approaches for quantitative and objective assessment of skills based on =
machine learning and multimodal sensors, and 3) to promote the usage of =
and evaluate the developed systems and tools in medical contexts within =
the simulation center of the university and the collaborating medical =
simulation and training centers.

For this project, we are looking for one postdoc or research engineer =
and one PhD student in the area of virtual reality and artificial =
intelligence in medical and surgical training. The project will last =
three years. The MediCIS/LTSI lab <https://medicis.univ-rennes1.fr/> is =
located within the medical university and is composed of researchers =
both from engineering and medicine working together on societal high =
value projects, in a context of responsible research, aware of social, =
environmental and ethical impacts.
