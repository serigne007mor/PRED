Subject: [liste-egc] [cfp]: 5th Workshop on Computational History
 (HistoInformatics 2019)

*** sorry for cross-postings ***

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The 5th Workshop on Computational  History (HistoInformatics 2019)

To be held in conjunction with the 23rd International Conference on
Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2019), Oslo, Norway,
September 12th, 2019.

             Submission deadline : July 1st, 2019.

https://sites.google.com/site/histoinformatics2019workshop/home
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The HistoInformatics workshop series brings together researchers in the 
historical disciplines, computer science and associated disciplines as 
well as the cultural heritage sector. Historians, like other humanists, 
show keen interests in computational approaches to the study and 
processing of digitized sources (usually text, images, audio). In 
computer science, experimental tools and methods stand the challenge to 
be validated regarding their relevance for real-world questions and 
applications. The HistoInformatics workshop series is designed to bring 
researchers in both fields together, to discuss best practices as well 
as possible future collaborations.

HistoInformatics workshops took place four times in the past. The first 
one, HistoInformatics2013, was held in conjunction with the 5th 
International Conference on Social Informatics (SocInfo2013) in Kyoto, 
Japan in 2013. The second workshop, HistoInformatics2014, took place at 
the same conference (SocInfo2014) in the following year in Barcelona. 
The third, HistoInformatics2016 was at Digital Humanities 2016 
conference in Krakow, Poland, while the fourth one, HistoInformatics2017 
was held in conjunction with CIKM2017 International Conference on 
Knowledge Management in Singapore.

Our objective is to provide for the two different research communities a 
place to meet and exchange ideas and to facilitate discussion. We hope 
the workshop will result in a survey of current problems and potential 
solutions, with particular focus on exploring opportunities for 
collaboration and interaction of researchers working on various subareas 
within Computer Science and History Sciences.

-------------------------
**Themes and Topics**
-------------------------

We invite papers from a wide range of topics which are of relevance for 
history, the cultural heritage sector and the humanities in general. 
Besides original research papers, we also invite submissions of diverse 
types including position papers, project descriptions, or demo type papers.

The workshop targets researchers who work on the intersections of 
history and computer science.

The papers on the following and related topics (but not limited to) are 
especially welcome:

* Natural language processing and text analytics applied to historical 
documents
* Analysis of longitudinal document collections
* Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis
* Search and retrieval in document archives and historical collections, 
associative search
* Causal relationship discovery based on historical resources
* Named entity recognition and disambiguation
* Entity relationship extraction, detecting and resolving historical 
references in text
* Finding analogical entities over time
* Network Analysis
* Computational linguistics for old texts
* Analysis of language change over time
* Modelling evolution of entities and relationships over time
* Automatic multimedia document dating
* Simulating and recreating the past course of actions, social 
relations, motivations
* Handling uncertain and fragmentary text and image data
* Mining Wikipedia for historical data
* OCR and transcription old text
* Effective interfaces for searching, browsing or visualizing historical 
data collections
* Studies on collective memory
* Studying and modeling forgetting and remembering processes
* Estimating credibility of historical findings
* Epistemologies in the Humanities and Computer Science
* Computer Vision applied to historical image collections

---------------------
**Important Dates**
---------------------

* Paper submission deadline: 1st July 2019 (23:59 Hawaii Standard Time)
* Notification of acceptance: 25th July 2019
* Camera ready copy deadline: 30th July 2019
* Workshop date: 13th September 2019 (tentative)

---------------------------
**Submission Information**
---------------------------

Full paper submissions are limited to *10 pages*, while short paper 
submissions should be less than *5 pages* (including bibliography).

Submissions need to be:

* formatted according to https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors.
* original and have not been submitted for publication elsewhere.
* submitted in English in PDF format at 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=histoinformatics2019.

Submissions will be evaluated by at least three different reviewers with 
backgrounds in Computer Science and History.

The accepted papers will be published on *CEUR Workshop Proceedings* 
(http://ceur-ws.org/).

Presenters and participants are expected to cover their travel and 
accommodation costs.
