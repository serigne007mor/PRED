******************************************************

KES 2020 Special Session - IS20- Preventing risks and analysing events 
through social media analysis in
24th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent 
Information & Engineering Systems
Verona, Italy, 16-18 September 2020
http://kes2020.kesinternational.org/

Important dates:
Submission of papers: 3 April 2020
Notification of acceptance: 1 May 2020

Within the scope of the KES conference, this session specifically 
addresses the security-related domains of (a) preventing risks and 
making alerts (b) assisting the analysis and understanding of events, 
through automatic social media analysis.

Among the applications, we can quote as examples:
-    Depression detection
-    Rumour detection

-    Fake news and conspiracy theory detection
-    Organised crime and cybercrime
-    Art, goods, and human traffic

Among the research challenges, we can quote (although not limited to):
-    Entity linking
-    Information extraction
-    Cross-media analysis
-    Community detection
-    Video analysis
-    Weak signal detection
-    Visual representation
-    Information summarization
-    Ethics

The format of the submissions is the same as in the general KES 
conference and should present original research work (more details at 
http://kes2020.kesinternational.org/submission.php).

The conference proceedings will be published in Elsevier's Procedia 
Computer Science open access journal, available in ScienceDirect and 
submitted to be indexed/abstracted in CPCi (ISI conferences and part of 
Web of Science), Engineering Index, and Scopus. This conference is 
ranked B in Core Portal.
