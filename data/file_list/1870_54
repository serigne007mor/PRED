Mara Abel (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil)

Title: Ontology application in the petroleum industry
Abstract: The petroleum production chain configures a complex sequence =
of activities that require specialized knowledge and large volume of in=
formation from diverse sources and types. Considering the high level of=
 requested knowledge, several specialized providers assume part of the =
activities producing information and data that are integrated during pr=
ocess decision, production monitoring, and optimization. In this non-st=
andardize scenario, semantic treatment becomes a key issue to allow int=
eroperability between systems and enterprise information consumption. O=
ntology engineering came with the adequate tools for dealing with seman=
tic in this environment nowadays, by orienting the development of domai=
n ontologies and the embodiment of the ontology artifacts into informat=
ion system applications. This talk will describe use cases of domain on=
tologies in petroleum industry environment for information retrieval, e=
xpert system applications, digital twin for implementation and decision=
 making applications, highlighting details of the each project developm=
ent.

Bio: Mara Abel is geologist and doctor in Computer Science, studying kn=
owledge engineering applied to Petroleum Industry. She is a retired tit=
ular professor of UFRGS, in Brasil, where she has been dedicated to inv=
estigate and build ontologies for dealing with interoperability problem=
s in petroleum industry. She is co-founder of the knowledge-based softw=
are company ENDEEPER and she has conceived several successful industria=
l applications for reservoir characterization and production optimizati=
on in industrial cooperation projects.

Emilio Sanfilippo (National Research Council of Italy)

Title: Ontologies in Digital Humanities: Some Research Challenges
Abstract: Ontologies are extensively used in both research and applicat=
ions within the realm of digital humanities, with one of the most notab=
le examples being the CIDOC-CRM ontology and its extensions. Similarly =
to other domains of application, ontologies within the digital humaniti=
es serve diverse purposes, including the seamless organization of datas=
ets across multiple organizations to enable their smooth sharing and in=
tegration. However, within this landscape, critical studies pertaining =
to the interpretive reception of artworks =E2=80=93 or any entity centr=
al to humanities research =E2=80=93 have remained at the margins of kno=
wledge representation and data modeling efforts. Consequently, while nu=
merous digital platforms offer ontology-based datasets, only a few expl=
icitly address the interpretive dimension of scholarly inquiries. This =
absence is somewhat surprising considering the significance of interpre=
tive phenomena in critical studies of fine art, literature, music, thea=
ter, and other disciplines. During this presentation, I will briefly ex=
plore the utilization of ontologies in the digital humanities, discussi=
ng the challenges researchers must confront, in my opinion, to comprehe=
nd the multifaceted nature of scholarly research in the humanities. The=
se challenges encompass the development of methodologies and formal mod=
els to represent scholarly interpretations and debates.

Bio: Emilio Sanfilippo is a permanent researcher at the National Resear=
ch Council of Italy, affiliated with the Laboratory for Applied Ontolog=
y (LOA) within the Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (I=
STC). His research encompasses foundational and applied topics concerni=
ng the utilization of ontologies in both industrial engineering and the=
 digital humanities. Presently, he serves as the principal investigator=
 of the MITE project - Make it Explicit: Documenting interpretations of=
 literary fictions with conceptual formal models, funded by the Italian=
 Ministry for University and Research (MUR).

Series Description
------------------

The IAOA [3] has created ESAO [1], an educational effort directed towar=
ds topics of Applied Ontology, primarily established basics and foundat=
ions.

The series is inspired by the Interdisciplinary Schools on Applied Onto=
logy (ISAO) [4]. ESAO is complementary in format and its overall approa=
ch. The goal is to provide a combination of an archive of educational m=
aterial (e.g., short video lectures) and a series of webinars for prese=
nting and discussing that material.

Organization
------------

Members of the Education Technical Committee of IAOA [5] and among thos=

* Frank Loebe
* Sandra Lovren=C4=8Di=C4=87
