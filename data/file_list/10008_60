CALL FOR PAPERS
18th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2012)
August 12-16, 2012
Beijing, China

http://www.kdd.org/kdd2012/

Key Dates:
Papers due: February 10, 2012
Acceptance notification: May 4, 2012

Paper submission and reviewing will be handled electronically. Authors shou=
ld consult the conference Web site for full details regarding paper prepara=
tion and submission guidelines.

Papers submitted to KDD 2012 should be original work and substantively diff=
erent from papers that have been previously published or are under review i=
n a journal or another conference/workshop.

As per KDD tradition, reviews are not double-blind, and author names and af=
filiations should be listed.

Due to the large number of submissions, papers submitted to the research tr=
ack will not be considered for publication in the industry/government track=
 and vice-versa. Authors are encouraged to carefully read the conference CF=
P and choose an appropriate track for their submissions. In case of doubts,=
 authors are encouraged to get in touch with the chairs of the correspondin=
g track at least a week before the submission deadline.


RESEARCH TRACK

We invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspect=
s of knowledge discovery and data mining. Examples of topic of interest inc=
lude (but are not limited to): association analysis, classification and reg=
ression methods, semi-supervised learning, clustering, factorization, trans=
fer and multi-task learning, feature selection, social networks, mining of =
graph data, temporal and spatial data analysis, scalability, privacy, secur=
ity, visualization, text analysis, Web mining, mining mobile data, recommen=
der systems, bioinformatics, e-commerce, online advertising, anomaly detect=
ion, and knowledge discovery from big data, including the data on the cloud=
. Papers emphasizing theoretical foundations, novel modeling and algorithmi=
c approaches to specific data mining problems in scientific, business, medi=
cal, and engineering applications are particularly encouraged. We welcome s=
ubmissions by authors who are new to the KDD conference, as well as visiona=
ry papers on new and emerging topics. Authors are explicitly discouraged fr=
om submitting papers that contain only incremental results and that do not =
provide significant advances over existing approaches.  Application oriente=
d papers that make innovative technical contributions to research are welco=
me.

Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality=
, potential impact, and clarity of writing. For papers that rely heavily on=
 empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clea=
r, well executed, and repeatable. Authors are strongly encouraged to make d=
ata and code publicly available whenever possible.


INDUSTRY&  GOVERNMENT TRACK

The Industrial/Government Applications Track solicits papers describing imp=
lementations of KDD solutions relevant to industrial or government settings=
. The primary emphasis is on papers that advance the understanding of pract=
ical, applied, or pragmatic issues related to the use of KDD technologies i=
n industry and government and highlight new research challenges arising fro=
m attempts to create such real KDD applications. Applications can be in any=
 field including, but not limited to: e-commerce, medical and pharmaceutica=
l, defense, public policy, finance, engineering, environment, manufacturing=
, telecommunications, and government.

The Industrial/Government Applications Track will consist of competitively-=
selected contributed papers. Submitters must clearly identify in which of t=
he following three sub-areas their paper should be evaluated as distinct re=
view criteria will be used to evaluate each category of submission.

=B7 Deployed KDD systems that are providing real value to industry, Governm=
ent, or other organizations or professions. These deployed systems could su=
pport ongoing knowledge discovery or could be applications that employ disc=
overed knowledge, or some combination of the two.

=B7 Discoveries of knowledge with demonstrable value to Industry, Governmen=
t, or other users (e.g., scientific or medical professions). This knowledge=
 must be "externally validated" as interesting and useful; it can not simpl=
y be a model that has better performance on some traditional KDD metric suc=
h as accuracy or area under the curve.

=B7 Emerging applications and technology that provide insight relevant to t=
he above value propositions. These emerging applications must have clear us=
er interest and support to distinguish them from KDD research papers, or th=
ey must provide insight into issues and factors that affect the successful =
use of KDD technology and methods. Papers that describe infrastructure that=
 enables the large-scale deployment of KDD techniques also are in this area.
