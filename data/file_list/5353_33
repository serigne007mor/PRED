Subject: [liste-egc] First CfP: CIRCLE 2022: The 2nd edition of the Joint
 Conference of the Information Retrieval Communities in Europe

CIRCLE 2022 | 2nd edition of the Joint Conference of the Information 
Retrieval Communities in Europe
July 2022, Samatan, Gers, France

========================
Call for Papers
========================

=== SCOPE===

The second edition of CIRCLE will take place on July 2022 at Samatan, 
Gers, south of France (50 minutes from Toulouse). More information at 
https://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE/.
CIRCLE arose from a twofold wish to gather three national Information 
Retrieval (IR) conferences and to offer young researchers the 
opportunity to meet and discuss with senior researchers. CIRCLE is 
supported by the ARIA French conference (CORIA, COnférence en Recherche 
d’Information et Applications), the Spanish Conference on Information 
Retrieval (CERI, Congreso Español de Recuperación de Información), the 
Italian Information Retrieval Workshop, and the Swiss IR community. The 
main objective of CIRCLE is to propose a unique place for stimulating 
and disseminating research in IR, where senior/industrial and early 
stage researchers (including MSc and PhD students) can network and 
discuss their research results in a friendly environment.

== KEY PERIODS===
● Spring 2022 (March- April): submission deadline (long, short, demo, 
resource and extended abstracts)
● July 2022: conference

====TOPICS OF INTEREST======
CIRCLE 2022 welcomes both theoretical and experimental papers on core IR 
and papers on connections between IR and close disciplines including but 
not limited to natural language understanding and information 
extraction.  Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:

● Search and ranking. Research on core IR algorithmic topics, including IR
● Content analysis, recommendation and classification. Research focusing 
on recommender systems, rich content representations and content analysis
● Domain-specific applications. Research focusing on domain-specific IR 
challenges
● Artificial intelligence, semantics and dialog. Research bridging AI 
and IR, especially toward deep semantics and dialog with intelligent agents
● Human factors and interfaces. Research into user-centric aspects of 
IR, including user interfaces, behavior modeling, privacy, and 
interactive systems
● Evaluation. Research that focuses on the measurement and evaluation of 
IR systems
● IR architectures. Research dealing with IR system architectures and 
scalability
● Future directions. Research with theoretical or empirical 
contributions on new technical or social aspects of IR, especially in 
more speculative directions or with emerging technologies

=====
PAPER SUBMISSION
=====
Authors are invited to submit one of the following types of contributions:
● Long original papers (from 6 to 9 pages including references) 
describing mature and original research results
● Short original papers (from 3 to 5 pages including references) which 
typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a 
long paper, such as for example “doctoral papers”. In particular, novel 
but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance into this 
category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental 
validation or lacking strong theoretical foundation.
● Resource and demo papers (from 3 to 7 pages including references). A 
resource paper describes IR test collections software tools made 
available to the IR research community. Demo papers showcasing new 
technologies and prototypes in the cope of CIRCLE
● Extended abstracts (up to 3 pages including references) containing 
descriptions of ongoing projects or presenting already published results

Manuscripts should be submitted to CIRCLE’22’s Easychair site 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=circle2022) in PDF format and 
must be in English using the current ACM two-column conference format. 
Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the ACM 
Website (use the“sigconf” proceedings template).
Long and short submissions must be anonymous and will be peer reviewed 
by at least 3 reviewers in a double-blind process by the CIRCLE common 
program committee. Resource and demo submissions as well as extended 
abstracts are not anonymous and will be peer reviewed by at least 3 
reviewers in a single-blind process by the CIRCLE common program committee
The conference language will be English.
