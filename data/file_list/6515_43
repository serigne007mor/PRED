*Vacancy for Postdoctoral Fellow*

*//*

*/Department of Radiology and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics)/*

*/Stanford University School of Medicine/*

The Laboratory of Quantitative Imaging Informatics at Stanford 
University is recruiting a Postdoctoral Fellow. The Laboratory, led by 
Dr. Daniel Rubin in the Departments of Radiology and Medicine 
(Biomedical Informatics Research), focuses on cutting-edge research at 
the intersection of imaging science and biomedical informatics, 
integrating and analyzing imaging data with clinical and molecular 
information to discover the molecular basis for disease, and to use this 
knowledge to create translational applications that will transform 
medical care. We are developing methods and tools to discover and to 
extract quantitative and semantic imaging features of disease to define 
imaging phenotypes that can predict underlying tissue biological changes 
and define disease subtypes and to develop optimum treatments.  The 
vision is to bring emerging Big Data approaches to images, and to 
leverage our vast image archives for data-driven discovery, rapid 
learning, and decision support. We develop methods in imaging 
informatics and bioinformatics, including image processing, machine 
learning, knowledge representation, computer reasoning, natural language 
processing, and decision theory. Our exciting work is bridging the full 
spectrum of biomedical imaging, including radiology, pathology, 
ophthalmology, oncology, and cellular imaging, and it is being done with 
multidisciplinary collaborations with top scientists at Stanford as well 
as with other institutions internationally.

Research areas in the laboratory in include: (1) image processing 
methods to extract novel quantitative imaging features which 
characterize disease and predict the effectiveness of treatments; (2) 
automated image segmentation and quantification of abnormalities, 
correlating them with clinical and molecular features of disease; (3) 
software tools to annotate, process, and analyze radiology images to 
enable building a large structured image database for data mining and 
discovery; (4) methods to retrieve similar images (content based image 
retrieval) from large-scale image archives; (5) Big Data methods for 
image analysis, federated cloud-based computing with massive image 
datasets, bringing analysis algorithms to the data and aggregating 
partial results; (6) rapid learning systems for healthcare through 
finding patients with similar imaging/clinical/genomic characteristics;  
(7) natural language processing of radiology reports to extract semantic 
features describing images and to enable computerized assessment of 
image meaning; (8) analyzing integrated imaging and molecular data to 
discover imaging signatures of disease and its response to treatment; 
and (9) translation of the prior endeavors into practice by developing 
"intelligent" image viewing workstations.

Candidates should have post-graduate degree (MD or PhD) and training in 
Biomedical Informatics, Computer Science, or a related discipline with a 
background or strong interest in imaging science and a record of 
distinguished scholarly achievement.

Interested applicants should submit a Curriculum Vitae, a brief 
statement of research interests, and three letters of reference in one 
PDF document to rubin-lab-jobs@lists.stanford.edu.
