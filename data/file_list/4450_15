as:

academic search.

> - Mining the scientific literature, such as:

literature.
>     . Natural language processing (e.g., citation contexts).
>     . Discourse modelling and argument mining.
>=20
> - Academic search/recommender systems, such as:
>     . Modelling the multifaceted nature of scientific information.
>     . Building test collections for reproducible BIR.

as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple =

> Searching for scientific information is a long-lived information need. =
 In the early 1960s, Salton (1963) was already striving to enhance =
information retrieval by including clues inferred from bibliographic =
citations.  The development of citation indexes pioneered by Garfield =
(1955) proved determinant for such a research endeavour at the =
crossroads between the nascent fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and =
Bibliometrics [Bibliometrics refers to the statistical analysis of the =
academic literature (Pritchard, 1969) and plays a key role in =
scientometrics: the quantitative analysis of science and innovation =
(Leydesdorff & Milojevic, 2015)].  The pioneers who established these =
fields in Information Science---such as Salton and Garfield---were =
followed by scientists who specialised in one of these (White & McCain, =
1998), leading to the two loosely connected fields we know of today.
>=20
> The purpose of the BIR workshop series founded in 2014 is to tighten =
up the link between IR and Bibliometrics.  We strive to get the =
=E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=80=99 =
(White & McCain, 1998) active in both academia and the industry =
together, who are developing search engines and recommender systems such =
as ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, and =
Semantic Scholar, just to name a few.
>=20
> These bibliometric-enhanced IR systems must deal with the multifaceted =
nature of scientific information by searching for or recommending =
academic papers, patents, venues (i.e., conferences or journals), =
authors, experts (e.g., peer reviewers), references (to be cited to =
support an argument), and datasets.  The underlying models harness =
relevance signals from keywords provided by authors, topics extracted =
from the full-texts, coauthorship networks, citation networks, and =
various classifications schemes of science.
> Bibliometric-enhanced IR is a hot topic whose recent developments made =
the news---see for instance the Initiative for Open Citations (Shotton, =
2018) and the Google Dataset Search (Castelvecchi, 2018) launched on =
September 4, 2018.  We believe that BIR@ECIR is a much needed scientific =
event for the =E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=
=80=99 to meet and join forces pushing the knowledge boundaries of IR =
applied to literature search and recommendation.

class=3D"">=3D=3D=3D Aim of the Workshop =3D=3D=3D<br class=3D"">Searching=
 for scientific information is a long-lived information need. &nbsp;In =
the early 1960s, Salton (1963) was already striving to enhance =
information retrieval by including clues inferred from bibliographic =
citations. &nbsp;The development of citation indexes pioneered by =
Garfield (1955) proved determinant for such a research endeavour at the =
crossroads between the nascent fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and =
Bibliometrics [Bibliometrics refers to the statistical analysis of the =
academic literature (Pritchard, 1969) and plays a key role in =
scientometrics: the quantitative analysis of science and innovation =
(Leydesdorff &amp; Milojevic, 2015)]. &nbsp;The pioneers who established =
these fields in Information Science---such as Salton and Garfield---were =
followed by scientists who specialised in one of these (White &amp; =
McCain, 1998), leading to the two loosely connected fields we know of =
today.<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">The purpose of the BIR workshop =
series founded in 2014 is to tighten up the link between IR and =
Bibliometrics. &nbsp;We strive to get the =E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 =
and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=80=99 (White &amp; McCain, 1998) active in =
both academia and the industry together, who are developing search =
engines and recommender systems such as ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX, Google =
Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, and Semantic Scholar, just to name a =
few.<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">These bibliometric-enhanced IR systems =
must deal with the multifaceted nature of scientific information by =
searching for or recommending academic papers, patents, venues (i.e., =
conferences or journals), authors, experts (e.g., peer reviewers), =
references (to be cited to support an argument), and datasets. &nbsp;The =
underlying models harness relevance signals from keywords provided by =
authors, topics extracted from the full-texts, coauthorship networks, =
citation networks, and various classifications schemes of science.<br =
class=3D"">Bibliometric-enhanced IR is a hot topic whose recent =
developments made the news---see for instance the Initiative for Open =
Citations (Shotton, 2018) and the Google Dataset Search (Castelvecchi, =
2018) launched on September 4, 2018. &nbsp;We believe that BIR@ECIR is a =
much needed scientific event for the =E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98citationists=E2=80=99 to meet and join forces pushing the =
knowledge boundaries of IR applied to literature search and =
