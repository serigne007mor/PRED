*“Transactions on Large- Scale Data and Knowledge-Centered Systems”*

*TLDKS*

(LNCS Journal Subline)

*General:*

Data management, knowledge discovery as well as knowledge processing are 
core and hot topics in computer science. They are widely accepted as 
enabling technologies for modern enterprises enhancing their 
performance, especially in the decision making process. Since the 1990s 
the Internet has been the outstanding driving force for application 
development in all domains.

An increase in the demand of resource sharing (e.g. computing resources, 
services, metadata, data sources) across different sites connected 
through networks leads to an evolvement of data and knowledge management 
systems from centralized systems to decentralized systems enabling large 
scale distributed applications providing high scalability. Current 
decentralized systems still focus on data and knowledge as their main 
resource characterized by:

/heterogeneity/ of nodes, data and knowledge

/autonomy/ of data and knowledge sources and services

/large scale/ data volumes, high numbers of data sources, users, 
computing resources

/dynamics/ of nodes

Considering these characteristics recognize:

(i) limitations of methods and techniques developed for centralized systems

(ii) requirements to extend or design new approaches and methods 
enhancing efficiency, dynamics and scalability

(iii) development of large scale, experimental platforms and relevant 
benchmarks to evaluate and validate scaling

Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) 
techniques and agent systems supporting with scaling and decentralized 
control. Synergy between Grids, P2P systems and agent technologies is 
the key to data and knowledge centered systems in large scale environments.

The objective of the international journal on Large Scale Data and 
Knowledge Centered Systems is to provide an opportunity to disseminate 
original research contributions and a high quality communication 
platform for researchers and practitioners. The journal contains sound 
peer reviewed papers (research, state of the art and technical) of high 
quality.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

· Data Storage and Management

· Data Integration and Metadata Management

· Data Stream Systems

· Data/Web Semantics and Ontologies

· Knowledge Engineering and processing

· Sensor Data and Sensor Network

· Dynamic Data Placement Issues
