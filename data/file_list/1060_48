CALL FOR PAPERS

With the emergence of Web 2.0, the user became the heart of various 
technologies that compose this new era such as mashups, collaborative 
environments, social networks, etc. The main added ingredient is 
certainly the social dimension with the aim of linking users together to 
facilitate their interaction and make it richer and more productive. The 
social Web is increasingly becoming the most interesting part of the Web 
and is at the point of challenging well established Web players such as 
the traditional search engines, e.g., Google. This is a huge step 
forward from a user perspective but also opens up great prospects for 
research in an environment that becomes increasingly complex, less 
structured and more hostile considering the great mass of knowledge 
generally hidden from the user.

Social networks are the focus of most of the work being done around the 
social Web. Works in this area address in particular the structural 
properties, e.g., the strength of social connections, characterization 
of key players, etc. Apart from social networks, the social dimension 
may be found in other forms and other locations on the Web: social media 
such as YouTube and Flickr, social news like Digg or Twitter, or social 
bookmarking as Delicious (del.icio.us). All these forms constitute a 
huge container of social information with knowledge that may be useful 
to the user. This knowledge may be leveraged by, e.g., offering new 
value added services exploiting that knowledge, which otherwise is very 
poorly exploited by users and service providers today.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and young researchers 
from both academia and industry around issues related to the social 
interactions analysis through mining social data for providing users 
added value services. On the other hand, it is necessary to study and 
understand how services providers could leverage this huge mass of 
hidden knowledge for, e.g., business purposes, an issue facing all 
services providers in this area. Concretely, this includes confronting 
ideas in order to have a clearer view of the elements that surround this 
new phenomenon, to build a clear overview of advances in the various 
tracks related to the new Web era and then examining the scientific and 
industrial short, medium and long terms to rise around this hot topic.

The workshop includes the following topics (but not limited to):
     - Knowledge discovery from social data;
     - Social networks (personal/professional) analysis;
     - Social interactions analysis and aervice providers;
     - Social analysis for content and services personalization;
     - Social interactions analysis for information retrieval and filtering;
     - Social recommender systems
     - Community extraction and analysis;
     - Privacy and social interactions analysis;
     - Business models;
     - New challenges and applications of social interactions analysis 
for services providers;
     - etc.

	
Submission must be written in English and should not exceed 10 pages 
using the IEEE format. All the submissions will be reviewed by at least 
three reviewers. Authors should submit their articles electronically 
through the submission platform using the workshop website.
