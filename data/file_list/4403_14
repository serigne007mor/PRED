Subject: [liste-egc] Reminder: [CfP] ECML-PKDD 2020 Combined Call for
 Research and Applied Data Science Tracks

<html><head></head><body><div style=3D"font-family: Verdana;font-size: 12=
=2E0px;"><div>
<div>This is a joint call for papers for both the Research Track and the A=
pplied Data Science Track=2E</div>

<div>In the Research Track, we invite submissions of research papers from =
all areas of knowledge discovery, data mining and machine learning=2E Follo=
wing the tradition of ECML-PKDD, we are looking for high-quality papers in =
terms of novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of prese=
ntation=2E Papers should demonstrate that they provide a significant contri=
bution to the field (e=2Eg=2E, improve the state-of-the-art or provide a ne=
w theoretical insight)=2E</div>

<div>In the Applied Data Science Track, we invite papers that present inno=
vative applications of knowledge discovery, data mining and machine learnin=
g to solve challenging and important real world use cases, thereby bridging=
 the gap between practice and current theory=2E Papers should clearly expla=
in the real world challenge that is being addressed (including any peculiar=
ities of the data, like the size of the data set, noise levels, sampling ra=
tes, etc), the methodology that is being used, and the conclusions that are=
 drawn for the use case=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>KEY DATES AND DEADLINES:<br/>
Abstract submission deadline: March 19, 2020<br/>
Paper submission deadline: March 26, 2020<br/>
Author notification: June 4, 2020<br/>
All deadlines expire on 23:59 AoE (UTC - 12)=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PAPER FORMAT<br/>
Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the Springer =
LNCS guidelines=2E Author instructions, style files and the copyright form =
can be downloaded at http://www=2Espringer=2Ecom/gp/computer-science/lncs/c=
onference-proceedings-guidelines=2E</div>

<div>The maximum length of papers is 16 pages (including references) in th=
is format=2E The program chairs reserve the right to reject any over-length=
 papers without review=2E Papers that &lsquo;cheat&rsquo; the page limit by=
, including but not limited to, using smaller than specified margins or fon=
t sizes will also be treated as over-length=2E Note that for example negati=
ve vspaces are also not allowed by Springer&rsquo;s formatting guidelines=
=2E</div>

<div>Up to 10 MB of additional materials (e=2Eg=2E proofs, audio, images, =
video, data, or source code) can be uploaded with your submission=2E The re=
viewers and the program committee reserve the right to judge the paper sole=
ly on the basis of the 16 pages of the paper; looking at any additional mat=
erial is at the discretion of the reviewers and is not required=2E</div>

<div>In contrast to previous years, this year ECML-PKDD will apply a doubl=
e-blind review process (see also the double-blind reviewing process section=
 below for further details)=2E All papers need to be &lsquo;best-effort&rsq=
uo; anonymized=2E We strongly encourage to also make code and data availabl=
e anonymously (e=2Eg=2E, in an anonymous git repository or Dropbox folder)=
=2E It is allowed to have a (non-anonymous) pre-print online, but it should=
 not be cited in the submitted paper to preserve anonymity=2E Reviewers wil=
l be asked not to search for them=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>SUBMISSION PROCESS<br/>
Electronic submissions will be handled via EasyChair - https://easychair=
=2Eorg/conferences/?conf=3Decmlpkdd2020 (the research and applied data scie=
nce paper tracks will open soon)=2E</div>

<div>Before submitting, please consider carefully what the appropriate tra=
ck is (see top of page)=2E The track of choice can be indicated in the subm=
ission form=2E Submissions will be assessed in the track where they were su=
bmitted and cannot be transferred across tracks=2E</div>

<div>To submit a paper, please do the following:</div>

<div>Create an account and log into EasyChair=2E<br/>
Create a New Paper submission=2E<br/>
Select the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track=2E<br/>
Complete the submission=2E<br/>
Abstracts must be submitted by Thursday March 19, 2020 and full submission=
s must be submitted by Thursday March 26, 2020=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>DOUBLE-BLIND REVIEWING PROCESS<br/>
Submissions will be evaluated by three reviewers on the basis of novelty, =
technical quality, potential impact, and clarity=2E For the applied data sc=
ience track, one reviewer at least will come from industry=2E ECML-PKDD has=
 a long-standing reputation of a truly diverse conference where many topics=
 in Machine Learning and Data Mining are represented=2E To maintain this, d=
iversity of topics is also taken into account in the selection process=2E S=
ubmissions will be assessed in the track where they were submitted and will=
 not be transferred across tracks=2E</div>

<div>The reviewing process is double-blind (author identities are not know=
n by reviewers or area chairs; reviewers do see each other&rsquo;s names)=
=2E Papers must not include identifying information of the authors (names, =
affiliations, etc=2E), self-references, or links (e=2Eg=2E, github, youtube=
) that reveal the authors&rsquo; identities (e=2Eg=2E, references to own wo=
rk should be given neutrally like other references, not mentioning &lsquo;o=
ur previous work&rsquo; or similar)=2E However, we recognize there are limi=
ts to what is feasible with respect to anonymization=2E For example, if you=
 use data from your own organization and it is relevant to the paper to nam=
e this organization, you may do so=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE<br/>
For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference an=
d present the paper=2E Please make sure to make early travel arrangements a=
nd take care of possible immigration requirements (e=2Eg=2E, visa)=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PROCEEDINGS<br/>
The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture No=
tes in Computer Science Series (LNCS)=2E The proceedings will be published =
after the conference and will only include papers that were presented at th=
e conference=2E Online versions of the papers will be made available at the=
 time of the conference=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH PAPERS<br/>
Authors are strongly encouraged to adhere to the best practices of Reprodu=
cible Research (RR), by making available data and software tools for reprod=
ucing the results reported in their papers=2E Authors may flag their submis=
sions as RR and make software and data accessible to reviewers who will ver=
ify the accessibility of software and data=2E Links to data and code must b=
e inserted in the final version of RR papers=2E For accepted papers, we req=
uire the use of standard repository hosting services such as Dataverse, mld=
ata=2Eorg, OpenML, figshare, or Zenodo for data sets, and mloss=2Eorg, Bitb=
ucket, GitHub, or figshare (where it is possible to assign a DOI) for sourc=
e code=2E If data or code gets updated after the paper is published, it is =
important to enable researchers to access the versions that were used to pr=
oduce the results reported in the paper=2E Authors who do not have a prefer=
red repository are advised to consult Springer Nature&rsquo;s list of repos=
itories and research data policy=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>BEST PAPER AWARDS<br/>
Two student best research paper prizes will be awarded at the conference s=
ponsored by Springer&rsquo;s Data Mining and Machine Learning journals=2E I=
n order to be eligible for these awards, the first author of the paper need=
s to have been a (PhD) student on the day of the submission deadline: March=
 26, 2020=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>DUAL SUBMISSION POLICY<br/>
Papers submitted should report original work=2E Papers that are identical =
or substantially similar to papers that have been published or submitted el=
sewhere may not be submitted to ECML-PKDD, and the organizers will reject s=
uch papers without review=2E Authors are also not allowed to submit their p=
apers elsewhere during the review period=2E The dual submission policy appl=
ies during the period March 19 - June 4, 2020=2E</div>

<div>Submitting unpublished technical reports available online (such as on=
 arXiv), or papers presented in workshops without formal proceedings, is al=
lowed, but such reports or presentations should not be cited to preserve an=
onymity=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>AUTHORSHIP<br/>
The author list as submitted with the paper is considered final=2E No chan=
ges to this list may be made after paper submission, either during the revi=
ew period, or in case of acceptance, at the final camera-ready stage=2E</di=
v>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
