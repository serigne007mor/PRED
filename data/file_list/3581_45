## HIRING: machine learning research scientist

The Machine Learning Team at the National Institute of Mental Health =
(NIMH) in Bethesda, MD, has an open position for a machine learning =
research scientist. The NIMH is the leading federal agency for research =
on mental disorders and neuroscience, and part of the National =
Institutes of Health (NIH).

## About the NIMH Machine Learning Team

Our mission is to help NIMH scientists use machine learning methods to =
address research problems in clinical and cognitive psychology and =
neuroscience. These range from identifying biomarkers for aiding =
diagnoses to creating and testing models of mental processes in healthy =
subjects. Our overarching goal is to use machine learning to improve =
every aspect of the scientific effort, from helping discover or develop =
theories to generating actionable results.

We work with many different data types, including very large brain =
imaging datasets from various imaging modalities, behavioral data, and =
picture and text corpora. We have excellent computational resources, =
both of our own (tens of high-end GPUs for deep learning, several large =
servers) and shared within the NIH (a cluster with hundreds of thousands =
of CPUs, and hundreds of GPUs).

As a machine learning research group, we develop new methods and publish =
in the main machine learning conferences (e.g. NeurIPS and ICLR), as =
well as in psychology and neuroscience journals. Many of our problems =
require devising research approaches that combine imaging and =
non-imaging data, and leveraging structured knowledge resources =
(databases, scientific literature, etc) to generate explanations and =
hypotheses. You can find more about our work and recent publications at

https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt <https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt>

## About the position

We are seeking candidates who are capable of combining machine learning, =
statistical, and domain-specific computational tools to solve practical =
data analysis challenges (e.g. designing experiments, generating and =
testing statistical hypotheses, training and interpreting predictive =
models, and developing novel models and methods). Additionally, =
candidates should be capable of visualizing and communicating findings =
to a broad scientific audience, as well as explaining the details of =
relevant methods to researchers in a variety of domains.

Required experience:
- deep learning, using PyTorch or Tensorflow

Desirable experience:
- reinforcement learning
- Bayesian statistical modelling
- other types of modelling of human/animal learning and decision-making
- neuroimaging data processing/ analysis (any MRI modality, MEG, or EEG)
- other types of neural data (e.g. neural recording, calcium imaging)

all in the context of substantial research projects, ideally having led =
to submitted or published articles.

Finally, you should have demonstrable experience programming in =
languages currently used in data-intensive, scientific computing, such =
as Python, MATLAB or R. Experience with handling large datasets in high =
performance computing settings is also very valuable. Although this =
position requires a Ph.D. in a STEM discipline, we will consider =
applicants from a variety of backgrounds, as their research experience =
is the most important factor. Backgrounds of team members include =
computer science, statistics, mathematics, and biomedical engineering.

This is an ideal position for someone who wants to establish a research =
career in method development and applications driven by scientific and =
clinical needs. Given our access to a variety of collaborators and large =
or unique datasets, there is ample opportunity to match research =
interests with novel research problems. We also maintain collaborations =
outside of the NIH, driven by our own research interests or community =
impact.

If you would like to be considered for this position, please send =
francisco.pereira@nih.gov <mailto:francisco.pereira@nih.gov> a CV, with =
your email serving as cover letter. We especially encourage applications =
from members of underrepresented groups in the machine learning research =
community. If you already have a research statement, please feel free to =
send that as well. There is no need for reference letters at this stage. =
Other inquiries are also welcome. Thank you for your attention and =
interest!
