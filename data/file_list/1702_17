                    Intelligent Data Analysis - IOS Press
                               Special issue on
                   Dynamic Networks and Knowledge Discovery
                         
===============================================================================

Aim and Scope
-------------

Modelling and analysing networks is a major emerging topic in different research
areas, such as computational biology, social science, document retrieval, etc.
By connecting objects, it is possible to obtain an intuitive and global view of
the relationships between components of a complex system. Nowadays, the 
scientific communities have access to huge volumes of network-
structured data, such as social networks, gene/protein/metabolic networks,
sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks. Most often, these data are not only
static, but they are collected at different time points. This dynamic view of
the system allows the time component to play a key role in the comprehension of
the evolutionary behaviour of the network (evolution of the network structure
and/or of flows within the system). Time can help to determine the real causal
relationships within, for instance, gene activations, link creation/deletion,
information flow.

Handling such dynamic data is a major challenge for current research in machine
learning and data mining, and has led to the development of recent
innovative techniques that consider complex/multi-level time-evolving networks, 
graphs, heterogeneous information (nodes and links), and requires scalable
algorithms that are able to manage huge and complex networks. 

This special issue is motivated by the interest of providing a meeting point
for scientists involved in the intelligent analysis of large complex networks 
and more specifically in the dynamic aspects of such networks. It aims at 
attracting contributions from both aspects of dynamic networks
analysis: large real network analysis and modelling, and knowledge discovery
within those networks. Application of such techniques in the Bioinformatics or
Social Networks fields are most welcome in the special issue. 

Following the success of the DyNak workshop (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://kdd.di.unito.it/DyNaK2010/">http://kdd.di.unito.it/DyNaK2010/</a>)
joint with ECML/PKDD 2010 in Barcelona, we invite DyNaK's authors to send
extended versions of their workshop contribution. The special issue is however
open to relevant contributions that were not presented at the DyNak workshop
(see submission process below).
