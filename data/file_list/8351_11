CALL FOR PAPERS

International Workshop on "Definitions in Ontologies" at ICBO=20
2013 (International Conference on Biomedical Ontologies)
July 7, 2013
Montreal, Canada

Website: http://definitionsinontologies.weebly.com/


Ontologies built using OBO Foundry principles are advised to include=20
both formal (logical) definitions, as well as natural language=20
definitions. Depending on the effort, one or the other can be=20
underrepresented. Possible explanations to this bottleneck are the high=20
cost of producing well-written definitions; an insufficient=20
understanding of the nature of natural language definitions or of logic;=20
the lack of an operational theory of definitions; the lack of studies=20
that evaluate usability and effectiveness of definitions in ontologies;=20
a paucity of tools to help with definition authoring and=20
checking. Producing natural language definitions is time-consuming,=20
costly and prone to all kinds of inconsistencies. Producing logical=20
definitions that are effective, correct, and communicative is also=20
difficult. It is therefore worth exploring different ways of assisting,=20
with automation, creation and quality control of definitions.

This workshop gathers interested researchers and developers to reflect=20
upon general themes as the selection and modeling of defining=20
information; the relation between definitions in specific domains as=20
opposed to domain-independent definitions; the theoretical underpinnings=20
of definitions; tools that can facilitate relating logical and natural=20
language definitions. In addition, we would want to encourage=20
participation by different communities using definitions so that their=20
needs can be exposed.


FORMAT AND OUTCOMES

The workshop will consist of two parts. First, selected presentations of=20
short papers from attendees. Second, a guided discussion based on the=20
participants=C2=92 suggestions. This discussion is aimed at synthetizing an=
d=20
prioritizing defining practices. All papers should end with a suggestion=20
on the defining practices or users=C2=92 needs regarding definitions.  We=
=20
will, based on the presentations and discussion, collect a list of=20
recommendations relating to definitions in ontologies to be posted on=20
the workshop=C2=92s website.


INTENDED AUDIENCE

We solicit participation from developers and users from all around the=20
world and different linguistic communities in the areas of ontology,=20
natural language processing, information retrieval, logics, philosophy,=20
terminology and lexicology. We want to encourage participation of=20
ontologists and tool developers building ontology authoring tools;=20
philosophers and logicians who can shed light on the issues in creating=20
definitions; biomedical researchers interested in the role of=20
definitions in nomenclatures such as SNOMED; computer scientists=20
interested in the treatment of definitions in the framework of languages=20
like OWL; terminologists and lexicologists working on definitions and=20
their modeling; NLP researchers working on definition extraction=20
techniques or on information retrieval methods for definition=20
production; and NLP/IR researchers reusing definitions produced for=20
ontologies.


TOPICS

Topics of interest are split between foundational aspects, pragmatic=20
issues and user perspectives. Below we list some possible topics.

    * Quality control in definitions
    * Ways of evaluating definitions
    * Comparison and evaluation of different definition production=20
techniques:
handwritten, automatically generated from formal definitions, extracted from
corpora or constructed from information retrieved from corpora

    * (Multilingual) definition generation
    * Information retrieval for definition production
    * Use of definition models to facilitate information retrieval
    * Definition extraction from corpora
    * Interactions between ontologies and lexical resources (WordNet,=20
FrameNet)
    * Consequences/Strategies of giving necessary versus necessary and=20
sufficient
definitions, or simply sufficient definitions
    * Coordination of logical and textual definitions
    * Alternatives to and variants of definitions: elucidations,=20
explanations, glosses,

    * Assessment of definitions used in current practice
    * Balancing needs of within discipline use and wider use of definitions
    * Use of specialized terminology versus general vocabulary
    * Presentation of definitions to different user audiences
    * Alternatives/Augmentations of textual definitions, such as figures=20
and images
for anatomy, where textual definitions may be harder to formulate
