Subject: [liste-egc] Postdoctoral Position on Robots Learning Semantic
 Description of Objects from Web resources - ALOOF (Autonomous Learning of
 the Meaning of Objects) CHIST-ERA European project

*Postdoctoral Position on Robots Learning Semantic Description of Objects f=
rom Web resources - ALOOF (Autonomous Learning of the Meaning of Objects) C=
HIST-ERA European project*


*Job*

We are looking for a Postdoctoral researcher with a background in Natural L=
anguage Processing and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (in particula=
r semantic web and linked data) to join the Inria WIMMICS team (http://wimm=
ics.inria.fr). The context is the ALOOF (Autonomous Learning of the Meaning=
 of Objects) CHIST-ERA European project, which goal is to enable robots and=
 autonomous systems working with and for humans to exploit the vast amount =
of knowledge on the Web in order to learn about previously unseen objects i=
nvolved in human activities, and to use this knowledge when acting in the r=
eal world. More precisely, the project scenario consists of an open-ended d=
omestic setting where robots have to find objects.

Within this context, the goal of this postdoctoral position is to go beyond=
 the current-state-of-the-art in knowledge acquisition for cognitive system=
s by developing and combining techniques from text mining to allow robots t=
o engage in life-long learning from the Web. Techniques that can harvest th=
e Web to extract symbolic knowledge about objects and their characteristics=
 from unstructured text (relying on natural language processing and machine=
 reading techniques), as well as available ontologies and knowledge on the =
Semantic Web will be developed, grounding this knowledge in visual features=
 so that robots can recognize these objects in a real situation.

In particular, the following research tasks will be addressed:
- Building a visual object category knowledge base and a semantic object kn=
owledge base, relying on basic ontological knowledge about objects extracte=
d by analyzing unstructured and structured information sources on the Web f=
ollowing the learning by reading paradigm.
- Acquiring semantic knowledge concerning object properties from the web, t=
o propose objects which can satisfy a particular description or role in an =
activity.
- Iterative cross-modal learning starting from labels of unconstrained data=
, to efficiently acquire knowledge about an unknown object that has been en=
countered in real time.


*Profile*

Mandatory requirements for applicants:
1. PhD in Computer Science;
2. Experience in NLP, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Semantic Web,=
 or in a related field (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning...);
3. Hands-on experience of at least one programming language (e.g., Java, C+=
+) ensure autonomy in completing the technical tasks of the project;
4. Self-motivated, goal-oriented and willing to work in an international te=
am;
5. Fluent English is mandatory.

Optional:
1. Good control of scripting tools (bash, Unix/Linux tools) and of web lang=
uages;
2. Experience with automation of NLP processing chains

Project duration: 36 months
Deadline: open until filled
Working environment: the engineer will be employed at Inria Sophia Antipoli=
s, France, in the Wimmics team
Salary: Gross Salary per month according to the level of diploma and the ex=
perience in the domain: 2500 =E2=80=93 2800=E2=82=AC / month (corresponding=
