CALL FOR PAPERS

ECIR 2009 Workshop on
Contextual Information Access, Seeking and Retrieval Evaluation
April 6, 2009, Toulouse, France
http://www.irit.fr/CIRSE/

INVITED SPEAKER : DIANE KELLY

AIMS
The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together IR researchers
working on or interested in the evaluation of approaches to contextual
information access, seeking
and retrieval, and let them to share their latest research results, to
express their opinions on the related issues, and to promote discussion
on the future directions of evaluation.

BACKGROUND
Since the 1990s, the interest in the notion of context in Information
Access, Seeking and Retrieval increased. Many researchers have been
concerning with the use of
context in adaptive, interactive, personalized or collaborative systems,
the design of explicit and implicit feedback techniques, the
investigation of relevance, the application
of a notion of context to problems like advertising or mobile search.
Previous workshops and conferences, i.e. IR in Context (IRiX, 2005),
Adaptive IR (AIR, 2006, 2008), Context-based IR (CIR, 2005, 2007) and
Information Interaction in Context (IIiX, 2006, 2008) gathered
researchers exploring theoretical frameworks and applications which have
focussed on contextual IR systems.
An important issue which gave raise to discussion has been Evaluation.
It is commonly accepted that the traditional evaluation methodologies
used in TREC, CLEF, NTCIR and INEX campaigns are not always suitable for
considering the contextual dimensions in the information seeking/access
process. Indeed, laboratory-based or system oriented evaluation is
challenged by the presence of contextual dimensions such as user
interaction, profile or environment which significantly impact on the
relevance judgments or usefulness ratings made by the end user.
Therefore, new research is needed to understand how to overcome the
challenge of user-oriented evaluation and to design novel evaluation
methodologies and criteria for contextual information retrieval
evaluation. Until now, the experiments and results have been often
technology or application and no standard evaluation methodology or
standard test collections emerged from contextual information access,
seeking and retrieval research.

FORMAT
To discuss and compare different approaches to the topic of the
workshop, we will encourage the presentation and participation of both
researchers who are interested in methodological issues of evaluation
and contextual information access, seeking and retrieval, and
practitioners who have deployed and tested systems that make use
of user’s context.
To facilitate the presentation of research activities having a different
maturity, the workshop programme will include both long and short papers
covering a range of evaluation methods, techniques and tools for
contextual information access seeking and retrieval.
To give the young researchers an opportunity to present their results
and on-going research, they will be invited to submit short papers and
discuss their contributions in a less formal way. To this end, a short
time will be devoted to the presentation and a longer time will be
devoted to the discussion.

SUBMISSION
Original and unpublished papers are welcome on any aspect including:

• User, system and context modelling for information access seeking and
retrieval evaluation.

• Evaluation of implicit or explicit feedback techniques.

• Evaluation of personal information retrieval systems.

• Social media and networking based search.

• Learning algorithms that use non-traditional relevance judgments.

• Novel or extension of traditional evaluation measures.

• Novel techniques for collecting document relevance.

• Contextual and user simulation algorithms.

• Design of novel test collections.

• Accuracy evaluation of personal profiles built using implicit
set-level responses.

• Merging ranking from collaborative system outputs.

• Application and evaluation of context-based systems for distributed
retrieval, personal search, digital libraries, archives and museums.

• Application and evaluation of context-based access to television
broadcasted recordings, image, video and music collections.

Short papers and long papers will be respectively 2 pages and 4 pages
long using ACM format
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). All
submitted papers will  be peer-reviewed by the workshop programme
committee. At least one author of each paper must attend the workshop to
present the paper. All accepted papers will be published in the workshop
proceedings. For more information, please see the workshop website
