Subject: [liste-egc] CFP Special Issue on Web Data Quality in Intl. Journal
 on Semantic Web and IS


CFP: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SEMANTIC WEB AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS: 
SPECIAL ISSUE ON WEB DATA QUALITY

All details here: http://www.ijswis.org/?q=node/45

The standardization and adoption of Semantic Web technologies has 
resulted in an unprecedented volume of data being published as Linked 
Open Data (LOD). The integration across this Web of Data, however, is 
hampered by the "publish first, refine later" philosophy. This leads to 
various quality problems arising in the underlying data such as 
incompleteness, inconsistency and incomprehensibility. These problems 
affect every application domain, be it scientific (e.g., life science, 
environment), governmental or industrial applications.

This Special Issue is addressed to those members of the community 
interested in providing novel methodologies or frameworks in assessing, 
monitoring, maintaining and improving the quality of the Web of Data and 
also introduce tools and user interfaces which can effectively assist in 
the assessment. The benefits of such methodologies will not only help in 
detecting inherent data quality problems currently plaguing the Web of 
Data, but also provide the means to fix these problems and maintain the 
quality in the long run. Additionally, we also seek articles that help 
identify the current impediments in building real-world LOD applications.


*Topics*

The aim of this special issue is to select and publish a set of 
high-quality research papers on the aspects including but not limited to:

   - Web data and LOD quality concepts
      - Data quality dimensions and metrics for Web data and LOD quality
   - Web data and LOD quality methodologies
      - Data quality assessment frameworks
      - Evaluation of quality and trustworthiness in the web of data
      - (Semi-)automatic assessment in the web of data
      - Large-scale quality assessment of structured datasets
      - Validation of currently existing data quality assessment 
methodologies
      - Use-case driven quality assessment
      - Quality assessment leveraging background knowledge
      - Co-reference detection and dataset reconciliation
      - Data quality methodologies for linked open data
      - Evaluating quality of ontologies
   - Web data and LOD quality tools
      - Design and implementation of data quality monitoring, assessment 
and improvement tools
      - Quality exploration and analysis interfaces
      - Scalability and performance of tools
      - Monitoring tools
   - Case studies on Web data and LOD quality assessment and improvement
   - Web data and LOD quality benchmarks
   - Issues in LOD
      - Methods to acquire most relevant LOD datasets
      - Generating meaningful associations across LOD datasets
