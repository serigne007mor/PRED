== Research and Innovation Track ==
The Research and Innovation track at SEMANTiCS welcomes papers on novel 
scientific research and/or innovations relevant to the topics of the 
conference. Submissions must be original and must not have been 
submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must follow the guidelines 
given in the author instructions, including references and optional 
appendices. Each submission will be reviewed by several PC members who 
will judge it based on its innovativeness, appropriateness, and impact 
of results in terms of effectiveness at solving real problems.

= Important Dates:
* Abstract Submission Deadline:    March 22, 2021 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* Paper Submission Deadline:        March 29, 2021 (11:59 pm,Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance:         May 17, 2021 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

Author instructions: Reviews will be carried out in a single-blind mode. 
Long papers should have a maximum length of 15 pages and short papers of 
6 pages. Submissions should follow the guidelines of the Springer LNCS 
format. The detailed Call for Research and Innovation papers is 
available here: https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/calls

== Posters and Demos Track ==
The Posters and Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in 
progress, late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller 
contributions in all fields related to the Semantic Web and Linked Data 
in a broader sense. These include submissions on innovative applications 
with impact on end users, such as demos of solutions that users may test 
or that are yet in the conceptual phase but are worth discussing, and 
also applications or pieces of code that may attract developers and 
potential research or business partners.

= Important Dates:
* Paper Submission Deadline:        May 24, 2021 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance:         June 21, 2021 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

Hawaii time)

Author instructions: Proceedings are planned to be published via CEUR 
Workshop Proceedings and should follow the guidelines of the Springer
LNCS format.  The detailed Call for Poster and Demos papers is available 
online.

== Industry and Use Case Track ==
Focusing strongly on industry needs and ground breaking technology 
trends SEMANTICS invites presentations on enterprise solutions that deal 
with semantic processing of data and/or information. A special focus of 
Semantics 2019 will be on the convergence of machine learning techniques 
and knowledge graphs. Additional topics of interest are Enterprise 
Knowledge Graphs, Semantic AI & Machine Learning, Enterprise Data
Integration, Linked Data & Data Publishing, Semantic Search, 
Recommendation Services, Thesaurus and/or Ontology Management, Text 
Mining, Data Mining and any related fields. All submissions should have

Workshops and Tutorials at SEMANTiCS 2018 allow your organisation or 
project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased 
visibility. The workshops and tutorials will provide a forum for 
presenting widely recognised contributions and findings to a diverse and
knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a 
dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a 
closed format for research and commercial project consortia meetings.

= Important Dates for Workshops:
* Proposals  WS Deadline:        March 01, 2021 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance:         March 15, 2021 (11:59 pm, Hawaii

== Special Calls ==
Special calls or sub-topics are dedicated towards specific topics that 
are of special interest to the SEMANTiCS community. IN case we receive a 
sufficient amount of high quality submissions these topics will become 
special tracks within the conference program. For 2021 SEMANTiCS 
Amsterdam encourages submissions to the following sub-topics:

* Special Sub-Topic: Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage
* Special Sub-Topic: LegalTech
* Special Sub-Topic: Distributed and Decentralized Knowledge Graphs

Each sub-topic is managed by a distinct committee and encourages 
submissions from the scientific or industrial domain. Scientific 
submissions will undergo a thorough review process and will be published 
in the conference proceedings in case of acceptance. Industrial
submissions will be evaluated and selected according to the quality 
criteria of the industry track. WE are looking forward to your submissions!

== SEMANTiCS 2021 EU Organizing Committee ==
