Title: Explaining Recommender Systems via Why-Not questions - DEADLINE
EXTENDED!

Description
A recommender aids the user explore the set of items in a system and
find the most relevant items to him/her. The two basic recommender
categories are the context- and score-based ones. The first category
exploits the characteristics of users and items, while the latter
depends on the item scores given by the users. Traditional
implementations of recommenders are based on TF-IDF and nearest
neighbors techniques, while more recent recommenders follow machine
learning approaches, like matrix factorization and neural networks. A
natural issue that comes along with recommendations is whether a user,
or even the system designer understands the results of the recommender.
This problem has given rise to the so-called explainable recommenders.
Explainable recommendation helps to improve the transparency,
persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of
recommendation systems. It also facilitates system designers for better
system debugging [Zhang2018]. So far, the research in explainable
recommendations is focused on the Why question: “Why is an item
recommended?”. Solutions either consider the recommendation system as a
black-box, and thus try to reveal relationships among users and items,
the importance of different features with respect to the predicted value
(e.g., [Lundberg2017]), or to dwell into the intrinsic characteristics
of the recommendation system in order to truly explain the system
[Ghazimatin2020]. What has not yet been studied though, is the Why-Not
aspect of a recommendation: “Why is not a specific item a
recommendation?”. We argue that explaining why certain items or
categories of items are not recommended can be as valuable as explaining
why items are recommended. Why-Not questions have recently gained the
attention of the research community in multiple settings, e.g., for
relational databases [Bidoit2015]. In machine learning, Why-Not
questions are shown to improve the intelligibility of predictions
[Lim2009] but remain vastly unexplored.

In this thesis proposal we aim to explore Why-Not, machine learning
based explainable recommenders. In a second phase, we aim to extend the
recommenders so that they can leverage the Why-Not explanations for
auto-tuning.

Requirements and skills
The candidate should hold a Msc Degree in fields related to Computer
Science, Machine Learning, or Applied Mathematics/Statistics. She/He
should have solid knowledge of data management, algorithms and
programming. Knowledge and previous experience on machine learning,
recommender systems, explainability are a plus. She/He should master the
english language (oral and written); knowledge of the french language is
not obligatory. She/He must have strong analytical skills, be proactive,
self-driven and capable to collaborate with a group of international
researchers.

Duration and Location
The financing of the PhD position is for three years, full-time job
starting on October 2020. The successful candidate will work in the CY
Cergy Paris University. She/He will be also a member of the MIDI team of
the ETIS lab, whose researchers specialize on various types of data
(e.g., relational, web, multimedia, spatial) management, data
integration and data mining.
