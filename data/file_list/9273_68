    Announcement

In today's information-centric world, effective access to and use of 
knowledge is a key enabler for progress. Driven by the demands for 
intelligent applications and the explosion of information on the Web, 
the study of Knowledge Capture is crucially important. Knowledge Capture 
is the extraction of useful knowledge from diverse sources: unstructured 
information sources, semi-structured and structured data sources, 
knowledge graphs and directly from crowds and individuals, either 
through observation or implicit or explicit elicitation.

The wealth of information available from such a variety of sources calls 
for new methods of Knowledge Capture that draw both from traditional 
knowledge acquisition techniques and from more data-driven techniques 
such as large-scale data mining, statistical analysis and data analytics.

Researchers and practitioners who work in the area of Knowledge Capture 
traditionally participate in several distinct communities, including 
Knowledge Engineering, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, 
Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Inteligence and the Semantic Web. 
K-CAP 2015 will provide a forum to bring together members of disparate 
research communities who are interested in all aspects of capturing 
knowledge from a variety of sources, as well as those interested in 
creating representations that can be useful for reasoning, analysis, and 
other forms of machine processing.



------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Venue

This year's K-CAP conference will be held at the Dolce Palisades Hotel 
and Conference Center, just outside New York City. The Dolce Palisades 
is within 30 miles of the NYC airports: John F. Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia 
(LGA), Newark (EWR) and Westchester (HPN). The venue is minutes by car 
to the Metro North train with service to Grand Central Terminal in 
Manhattan.

K-CAP 2015 is also conveniently close in time and space to this year's 
International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2015) at Lehigh University 
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Although the two conferences are not quite 
"co-located", those at K-CAP 2015 can easily attend the last K-CAP 
plenary session, have their free K-CAP lunch and make it to Bethlehem to 
check in prior to the first day of ISWC activities.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
