Bonjour,

Nous proposons ce stage pour une durée de 6 mois, indemnisé 417 
euros/mois. Le stage débuterait entre février et avril 2012 en fonction 
de la disponibilité des candidats.
Pour toute explication complémentaire ou éclaircissement n'hésitez pas à 
nous contacter.

Intitulé du stage : Argumentation based preference aggregation

Origine: INRA IATE & INRIA Graphik LIRMM, Montpellier.

Scientific Overview:
The proposed master subject touches two important domains of Artificial 
Intelligence: knowledge representation and multi agent systems. We are 
interested from a KR view point at the representation and aggregation of 
preferences (an ordered list of possible choices). From an agent view 
point we are interested in the problem of argumentation (how to 
reconcile the view of two agents which might be conflicting). The aim of 
this master thesis is to investigate the state of the art of 
argumentation based preference aggregation [Kaci 2011] and how this can 
be applied in the practical scenario of the EcoBioCap project [Destercke 
et al., 2011].

The domain:
The EcoBioCap project is a big European funded project (15 partners) 
leaded by INRA IATE research lab in Montpellier. The aim of this project 
is to be able to propose useful and novel biodegradable packaging for 
food products. INRA IATE and INRIA Graphik teams are involved from a 
computer science view point. We aim at formalizing the different 
conflicts between the actors involved in packaging and proposing 
algorithms to reconciliate conflicts.

Why is this subject interesting?

1.      A first contact with industrial applied research (useful for 
people wanting to continue research either in an academic setting or an 
industrial one).
2.      A subject on (a) knowledge representation and reasoning and (b) 
multi agent systems (two main research areas in Artificial Intelligence) 
thus increased experience for a future PhD application.
3.      A close view of what an European Project involving Computer 
Science research is (and how financed research works).
4.      Work in close contact with both computer scientists and domain 
experts in agronomy.
5.      Lovely campus in the middle of a park.

Concrete example:
In order to explain our project let us use an informal example. Alice 
and Bob want to decide what to do tomorrow morning. Alice prefers to go 
to the beach than to go to see a rugby game in the pub. Bob, on the 
other hand prefers to go to see the rugby than to the beach. How to 
decide? (In this case each agent has given an ordered list of choices - 
their preferences regarding a certain activity). Alice argues that is 
better to go to the beach because is sunny, and she does not like little 
unimportant rugby games because nobody is in the pub. Bob, on the other 
hand, argues that tomorrow the forecast is rain, and that the game is 
the final. Alice, verifies the meteo forecast and realizes that, indeed, 
tomorrow will rain. On the other hand she likes to watch finals because 
of the nice atmosphere in the pub. The two happily decide to go and see 
the game tomorrow morning. (In the last step the argumentation was used 
in order to ``reason'' about agent's preferences).
