 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION - NLDB'2014

 19th International Conference on Application of Natural Language to 
 Information Systems

 18-20 June 2014 - Montpellier, France

 http://www.nldb.org/

 Registration (early bird registration deadline: May 15, 2014):
 http://www.lirmm.fr/~mroche/NLDB2014/Web/conf_registration.html

 ==============

 Since 1995, the NLDB conference aims at bringing together researcher, 
 industrials and potential users interested in various application of 
 Natural Language in the Database and Information Systems field. The 
 integration of databases and natural language has been an utopia for 
 many years. However, progress has been made and this is now an 
 established field thanks to developments in Natural Language and 
 technologies that made the storage and manipulation of large electronic 
 dictionaries possible. As Information Systems are now evolving into the 
 communication area, the term databases should be considered in the 
 broader sense of information and communication systems. The use of 
 Natural Language in Software Engineering has contributed to both 
 improving the development process from the viewpoints of developers 
 (improve the process of conceptual modeling, validation, etc) and the 
 usability of applications by users (natural language query interfaces, 
 semantic webs, etc).

 NLDB'2014 will take place in Montpellier (France). The conference 
 invites researchers from academia and industry to submit papers for oral 
 or poster presentations on recent, unpublished research that addresses 
 theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures for applied 
 and integrated NLP, resources for applied NLP, and other aspects of NLP, 
 as well as review and discussion papers.

 Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
 - Applications of NLP in Information Systems: Multilingual Information 
 Systems, NLP in Requirement Engineering, NLP in Knowledge Management, 
 Semantic Data Integration and Data Cleaning
 - Social Media and Web Data: Corpus analysis, Language identification, 
 Text normalization, Robust NLP for social media, Text classification, 
 Information Extraction and Sentiment Analysis for social media
 - Big Data and Natural Language
 - Semantic Web Open Linked Data: Ontology Learning and Alignment, 
 Populating ontologies, Querying Ontologies and linked data, Semantic 
 tagging and classification, Ontology-driven NLP
 - Question Answering (QA): NL interfaces to databases, QA using web 
 data, multi-lingual QA, Non-factoid QA (how/why/opinion questions, 
 lists), geographical QA, QA corpora and training sets
 - Natural language and Ubiquitous Computing: Pervasive Computing, 
 Embedded, Robotic and Mobile Applications.
 - Natural Language in Conceptual Modeling: Analysis of Natural Language 
 Descriptions, Terminological Ontologies, Consistency Checking, Metadata 
 Creation and Harvesting, Ontology-driven Systems Integration, Ontology 
 Management
 - NLP Applications: Business Intelligence, Subjectivity and Sentiment 
 Analysis, QA systems, Event Detection, Named Entity and Event Detection, 
 Information Extraction, Summarization, NLP for Data Mining, NLP for Data 
 Warehouses, Plagiarism detection, Identity detection

 INVITED SPEAKERS
 =================

 Sophia Ananiadou, University of Manchester, UK

 Topic of the talk: Applications of Biomedical Text Mining

 Brief biography: Sophia Ananiadou received her PhD in Natural Language 
 Processing (NLP) from the University of Manchester. She is Professor of 
 Computer Science in the School of Computer Science, University of 
 Manchester and has led the National Centre for Text Mining 
 (www.nactem.ac.uk) since 2007. She researches into semantic text mining 
 and semantic search techniques for applications in domains such as 
 systems biology, public health, chemistry and social sciences. She is 
 also developing large-scale resources (terminological resources and 
 annotated data), and interoperable text mining platforms. Her current 
 projects include semantic search for Europe PubMedCentral, supporting 
 evidence-based public health reviews in collaboration with NICE, mining 
 the history of medicine and extraction of semantic metadata for the 
 automated measurement of open source software. She has been a three 
 times recipient (2006-2008) of the IBM UIMA innovation award for her 
 work in interoperable platforms for text mining and was also awarded the 
 Daiwa Adrian prize (2004). She has authored over 250 publications.

 Gabriella Pasi, University of Milano Bicocca, Italy

 Topic of the talk: Personal ontologies

 Brief biography: Gabriella Pasi received a PhD in Computer Science at 
 the Université de Rennes, France. She has been working at the National 
 Council of Research in Italy till 2005. She is actually Associate 
 Professor at the Università Degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Milano, 
 Italy, where she leads the Information Retrieval Research Laboratory. 
 Her research activities mainly focus on personalised and contextual 
 access to information, and on the problem of aggregation in search. She 
 has served as the program chair of several international conferences and 
 workshops, and she has been the chair or co-chair of several 
 International events among which the IEEE / WIC / ACM International 
 Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, 
 Università degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, 15-18 September 2009, the PhD 
 School on Web Information Retrieval (WebBar 2007), the Seventh 
 International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQAS 
 2006), the European Summer school in Information Retrieval (ESSIR 2000), 
 and the annual track ?Information Access and Retrieval? within the ACM 
 Symposium on Applied Computing. She has published more than 180 papers 
 on International Journals and Books, and on the Proceeding of 
 International Conferences, and she is member of the Editorial Board of 
 the several International Journals.
