ECIR 2009, Workshop on Geographic Information on the Internet (WGII)

06 APRIL 2009, TOULOUSE, FRANCE

http://www.moromete.net/GII/index.htm <http://www.moromete.net/GII/index.htm>

http://ecir09.irit.fr <http://ecir09.irit.fr/>



Finding geographically-based information constitutes a common use of Web
search
engines, for a variety of user needs. With the rapid growth of the volume of
geographically-related information on the Web, efficient and adaptable
ways of
tagging, browsing and accessing relevant documents still needs to be found.
Structuring and mashing-up geographic information from different Web data
sources is
one appealing alternative to long term efforts of manually creating large
scale
geographic resources such as The Alexandria Digital Library[1] or
Geonames[2], whose
constructions are costly and not necessarily adapted to specific
applications.

Efficient automatic geographical information structuring methods involve
coping with
a wide diversity and huge volumes of geographically relevant documents.
Consider
Wikipedia (over 200,000 geo-referenced articles for the English version),
or Flickr
(over 50 million geo-referenced pictures) or Yahoo! Trip Planner (over
159,000
publicly available trip descriptions). These sites include disparate text,
images
and geo-localisation information. Exploiting this information requires mixing
different competences: information retrieval and ranking, natural language
processing, image processing, geographic information extraction...

Past events, such as the GIR workshops or the LocWeb workshops series,
focused on
geographic information retrieval (GIR), but many hard research questions
related to
GIR remain unsolved. We will address the following in this workshop:

*        How to move from raw data to structured knowledge? How can we
identify,
disambiguate, localize, categorize and rank geographic names?
*        What are the best ways to process geographically relevant
multimedia documents?
How to combine text, image and/or video analysis in coherent frameworks?
*        How to exploit user contributed information? How to filter out
noise introduce and
how to leverage information at a community level?
*        How to adapt and/or personalize the presentation of results?

This workshop brings elements of answers to these research questions and is a
meeting point for different disciplines interested in geographic
information. It
focuses on combining analysis skills to improve geographic information
processing.
We welcome researchers from communities as diverse as geographic information
extraction and retrieval, context aware devices, geographic information
systems or
image processing to discuss their ideas in a challenging and interactive
forum.

We solicit submissions addressing the following topics:

*        Web-scale geographic information retrieval frameworks
*        Geo-referenced image and video annotation and retrieval
*        Ranking for geographical search
*        Semi-automatic or automatic structuring of geographic information
*        Location based services
*        Indexing of geographically relevant multimedia documents
*        Visualization of geographic information
*        User studies in geographic information search
*        Domain specific applications

We target the edition of a journal Special Issue or of a book as a result
of the
workshop.



Submissions must be written in English following the LNCS guidelines
<http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-2-72376-0>  and must
not exceed
12 pages (for long papers) and 6 pages (for short papers) including
references and
figures. All papers and posters will be refereed by at least two reviewers.
