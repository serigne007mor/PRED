CALL FOR PAPERS --  ASONAM 2011

The International Conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2011)

http://asonam.im.nuk.edu.tw/

July 25-27, 2011 - Kaohsiung City, Taiwan

The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.

The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2011) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2011 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations.

General areas of interest to ASONAM 2011 include information science and mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology and medicine.

More specialized topics within ASONAM include, but are not limited to:

Instructions for Authors
Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining to the above topics are solicited.

Full paper submission deadline is March 1, 2011. These papers will follow an academic review process. Full paper manuscripts must be in English with a maximum length of 8 pages (using the IEEE two- column template).

Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), tel/fax numbers, abstract, and postal address(es) on the first page. Papers should be submitted to the conference Web site: asonam2011.im.nuk.edu.tw. If Web submission is not possible, manuscripts should be sent as an attachment via email toiting@nuk.edu.tw  by March 1, 2011. The attachment must be in PDF or Word .doc format.

Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Authors should certify that their papers represent substantially new previously unpublished work.
