SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
The special session on Fuzzy-based Simulation Approaches and Systems in =
Science and Engineering is conceived to be a forum for the exchange of =
ideas among researchers who are interested in computational models for =
fuzzy systems (e.g., for simulating fuzzy dynamical systems) and =
researchers who use fuzzy-based techniques in non-fuzzy domains (e.g., =
for simulating the states of networked systems).=20

In the last decades, computing methods based on fuzzy logic =
significantly contributed to the development of intelligent systems for =
decision making, identification, pattern recognition, optimization, and =
control. On the other hand, fuzzy set theory offered a way for modelling =
engineering systems/processes or biological phenomena associated with =
vague, uncertain or imprecise information.=20

The aim of this event is twofold: offering an overview of the current =
research and outlining new trends in the fuzzy-inspired simulation =
field. Both relevant theoretical contributions and applications are =
welcomed.

The FSASSE Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to the =
following areas:=20

- Fuzzy logic approaches in Evolutionary Computation, Swarm =
Intelligence, Genetic Algorithms
- Fuzzy approximation techniques
- Fuzzy data analysis, clustering, classification
- Adaptive, hierarchical and hybrid fuzzy systems=20
- Genetic fuzzy systems
- Uncertainty theory
- Fuzzy modeling, Fuzzy simulation and qualitative models
- Fuzzy dynamical systems
- Fuzzy systems with big data and cloud computing, fuzzy analytics
- Fuzzy control, robotics, sensors, and architectures=20
- Fuzzy decision models and support
- Fuzzy bio-inspired models and logic
- Fuzzy solutions in application domains (healthcare, manufacturing, =
pattern recognition and learning, transportation, energy systems, =
automation, business and finance, ...)
