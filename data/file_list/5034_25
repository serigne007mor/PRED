PhD Student Position in *Predictive Query Optimization for Multi-tenant 
Cloud DBMSs*
IRIT Lab. (http://www.irit.fr/) - Pyramid Team - Paul Sabatier 
University - Toulouse - France
Supervisor’s Name: Abdelkader Hameurlain (hameurlain@irit.fr)
Co-Supervisor’s Name: Franck Morvan  (morvan@irit.fr)

Pyramid Team (Dynamic Query Optimization in Large-scale Distributed 
Environments; http://www.irit.fr/-Equipe-PYRAMIDE-) is likely to get a 
PhD scholarship for 3 years (Doctoral School MITT, 
http://www.edmitt.ups-tlse.fr/).

*1.     Scientific Context *

In parallel and distributed large-scale environments (Cluster, Grid, 
Cloud), the Pyramid team addresses the main problems of query processing 
and optimization, targeting large volumes of data distributed in large 
scale.
In cloud environments, users are often called tenants. A cloud DBMS 
shared by many tenants is called a multi-tenant DBMS. The resource 
consolidation in such a DBMS allows the tenants to only pay for the 
resources that they consume, while providing the opportunity for the 
provider to increase its economic gain. For this, a Service Level 
Agreement (SLA) is usually established between the provider and a 
tenant. However, in the current systems, the SLA is often defined by the 
provider, while the tenant should agree with it before using the 
service. In addition, only the availability objective is described in 
the SLA, but not the performance objective. In one of our previous work 
[8], an SLA negotiation framework was proposed for OLAP applications, in 
which the provider and the tenant define the performance objective 
together in a fair way. To demonstrate the feasibility and the advantage 
of this framework, we evaluated its impact on query optimization. We 
formally defined the problem by including the cost-efficiency aspect, we 
designed a cost model and improved two execution plan search methods to 
adapt to the new context, and we proposed a heuristic to solve the 
resource contention problem caused by concurrent queries of multiple 
tenants. We also conducted a performance evaluation to show that, our 
optimization approach (i.e., driven by the SLA) can be much more 
cost-effective than the traditional approach which always minimizes the 
query completion time.

*2.     PhD Subject: * *Predictive Query Optimization for Multi-tenant 
Cloud DBMSs**
***
In the above work, we proposed a new criterion: the Unit Benefit Factor 
(UBF) which is the profit generated in a unit of time (by the execution 
of a query). For example, if a query lasts 2 seconds and it allows the 
provider to have 10 cents of profit, the UBF is then 5 cents / second. 
For each given query, the optimizer chooses the execution plan that 
maximizes this criterion. Obviously, this does not guarantee the maximum 
profit when considering all the queries of all tenants in a long term. 
Indeed, the workload of a multi-tenant DBMS varies over time and 
influences both the QoS (tenant side) and the economic cost (provider 
side). Some work proposes to build models in order to predict the future 
load [2, 4, 6, 9]. This prediction can help the optimizer to choose 
execution plans that improve both QoS and profitability in a long term 
[1]. Taking into account this prediction (that becomes a new constraint) 
requires extending the cost model and revisiting the search strategy.
In this perspective, the candidate is expected to design and develop a 
query optimization method by taking into account the workload 
prediction. More precisely, she/he will: (i) study the related work 
[e.g., 2-9], (ii) propose a predictive query optimization method that 
maximizes the provider’s long term profit while meeting the SLAs 
established with the tenants, and (iii) conduct an experimental study to 
evaluate and validate the proposed method.
