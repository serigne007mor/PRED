						    icsoc.org
						www.servicewave.eu


						 CALL FOR PAPERS

						In Cooperation with=20
					   ACM SIGSOFT & SIGWeb (Pending)


Service oriented computing is an interdisciplinary paradigm that
revolutionizes the very fabric of distributed software development,
including not only complex enterprise applications but also scientific,
mobile, telecommunications and embedded system-based applications.=20

The conference

This year ICSOC and European ServiceWave Conference series are particularly
pleased to join forces, with the aim to provide a world-leading forum and
unique opportunity for academic researchers and industry practitioners to
report on groundbreaking research work in service oriented computing.=20
The joint conference fosters the creation of cross-community scientific
excellence by gathering industrial and academic experts from various
disciplines such as business process management, distributed systems,
computer networks, wireless & mobile communication networks, grid computing,
networking, service science and software engineering.

The organization

The conference will feature research presentations, industrial panels and
keynotes, an exhibition space, as well as application and scientific
workshops and a PhD track. ICSOC/ServiceWave=ED09 places particular emphasis
on outstanding research papers leading towards the convergence of the
Internet of Services & Things.=20

RESEARCH PAPERS

	The conference is soliciting outstanding original research papers on
all aspects of service-oriented computing. Papers should clearly demonstrate
the research contribution, the relevance to service-oriented computing and
the relation to prior research. Submitted papers will be evaluated according
to their scientific rigor and on the basis of significance, originality,
technical quality, and exposition.=20

PAPER SUBMISSION
