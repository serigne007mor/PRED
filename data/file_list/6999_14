=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The 13th International Conference on Software Engineering Research,
Management and Applications (SERA 2015) provides an international forum
where engineers, researchers, and advanced graduate students are invited to
present their experiences and their recent advances and latest research
results related to all aspects of software engineering research and
applications. The conference is structured to cover the complete software
lifecycle from design through deployment to maintenance and evolution. SERA
2015 will include a high quality scientific program, invited speakers,
tutorials and workshops in conjunction with the conference.
