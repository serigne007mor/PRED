Two Postdoctoral positions at Bell Labs France, Alcatel-lucent.

The Social Communications Department (SocialCom) is part of the Application=
s Domain of the Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs France Research Laboratory, a lead=
ing company in tele-communications services. SocialCom studies social inter=
actions considering the new communication means e.g., mobile phone, Web 2.0=
 ecosystem, enabling the company to investigate new areas of communication =
and find new business opportunities. One of the aspect tightly related to s=
ocial interactions analysis is the end-user trying thus to offer added valu=
e services for these consumers. This constitutes a part of the research eff=
orts performed in the social communications department.

Position 1: Identity Disambiguation in the Social Web
*******************************************************************
Exchanged information in the social eco-systems could be leveraged by a lar=
ge number of services providers who could extract a valuable knowledge to e=
nrich their different processes. This information is generally stored into =
internal CRMs where the user is clearly identified. CRMs, as closed systems=
, are very poor compared to the huge information users spread on the Web 2.=
0 thanks to the new communication channel she is offered. Thus, a natural q=
uestion which may rise could be: What if services providers are offered a m=
eans to access additional information which may be leveraged to better serv=
e their customers? This is clearly an important issue and may be handled fr=
om different perspectives. However, one of the key issues services provider=
s are struggling with is the multiplicity of the identities a user may have=
 on the Web. In fact, users may subscribe to several social services genera=
lly with different profiles IDs and information. This raises two problems: =
(i) how to decide that different identities on the social Web refer to the =
same person? And (ii) how to match an identity, once calculated on the soci=
al Web, with CRMs' identities? This research work intends to study how mult=
iple identities could be approximated or identified on the social and then =
matched with CRMs identities. It's expected to set up a theoretical framewo=
rk and an implementation of the proposal of the work as well as the integra=
tion in real products.

Position 2: Impact of Social Networks on the Cloud Computing
***************************************************************************=
****
As Alcatel-Lucent is primarily an actor in tele-communication services, and=
 mainly on the infrastructure part, there is a growing interest in finding =
new strategies for integrating the cloud technologies in communication serv=
ices providers. Different issues are related to the cloud computing. We int=
end to investigate in this work the possible impacts of social networks and=
 digital social activities on the management and the lifecycle of the cloud=
 computing. We consider the case of a cloud computing infrastructure as a f=
uture model to which the majority of services providers, including tele-com=
munications providers, are moving to.

Candidates should have a PhD in Computer Science with a heavy background in=
 databases and data-mining plus knowledge of semantic technologies and the =
social Web. They should also have excellent programming skills as well as c=
ommunication skills in English (other languages are also appreciated). The =
autonomy and the creativity of the candidates will be strongly considered f=
or the selection.  Inquiries and expressions of interest (including researc=
h statement and CV) should be sent by e-mail to Hakim Hacid (hakim.hacid@al=
catel-lucent.com) before: 15th of August 2010.
