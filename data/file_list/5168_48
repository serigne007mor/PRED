Overview =F0=9F=97=BA=EF=B8=8F
~~~~~~~~
This competition consists in solving several challenges which arise
during the digitization of historical maps. We are particularly
interested in a large map series consisting in many Paris atlases over
half a century (1860's-1940's). For each year, a set of approximately
20 sheets forms a tiled view of the city. Such maps are highly detailed
and very accurate even by modern standards.

This material provides a very valuable resource for historians and a
rich body of scientific challenges for the document analysis and
recognition (DAR) community: map-related challenges (overlapping of
many information layers) and document-related ones (document
preservation).

We expect this competition to provide solutions for three levels of
scientific problems:

    Task 1: Detection of building blocks
    Task 2: Segmentation of map content within map sheets
    Task 3: Localization of graticule lines intersections


Key strengths for participants =F0=9F=9A=80
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Open and reproducible research:
  All datasets and evaluation tools are released with an open license.

* Good visibility:
  Winners of each task will be invited to co-author the report paper.

* Impactful:
  We propose unsolved research problems with an important potential
  impact.
