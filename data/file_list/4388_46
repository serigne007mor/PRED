Subject: [liste-egc] Workshop CI in IoT Data Management-2020


======================== Désolé pour les réceptions multiples 
======================================

Bonjour,

Pourriez-vous diffuser et faire circuler le CFP du workshop 
"Computational Intelligence in IoT Data Management" ci-dessous.

Cordialement,

Allel

==========================================================================

The 1st International Workshop on Computational Intelligence in IoT Data 
Management (CI2DM’2020)
In conjunction with the 5th International Conference on Real-Time 
Intelligent
Systems (RTIS), https://rtis2020.sigappfr.org/)
June 30 – July 3, 2020, Biarritz, FRANCE
========================

Workshop scope:
Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that connects multiple and 
diverse smart objects via Internet. Nowadays, this paradigm is receiving 
a momentous interest in a number of real-life fields including industry, 
transport, healthcare and smart cities. This interest will be more and 
more growing in the future due to the unprecedented number of 
objects/devices that will be connected in the world. Cisco reports that 
50 billion objects and devices will be connected to the Internet by 
2020. Automotive news states that the number of cars connected to the 
Internet will increase from 23 million in 2013 to 152 million in 2020. 
It is then expected that interconnected smart objects will become the 
major data producers and consumers instead of humans and they generate 
tremendous amounts of data using their sensors every single of second.  
Such IoT data are inherently uncertain, erroneous and noisy on the one 
hand, and voluminous, distributed and continuous on the other hand.
On the other hand, a smart environment is a connected small world where 
sensor-enabled connected devices work collaboratively to make the lives 
of persons comfortable, the business of enterprises much big and 
flourishing, and so on. It is capable of obtaining knowledge and 
applying it to satisfy more complex users’ needs.
Recent research efforts have been conducted to integrate IoT with smart 
environments. This integration allows extending the capabilities of 
smart objects by enabling the user to monitor the environment from 
remote sites. IoT-based smart environments have two main and unique 
characteristics: the prediction capabilities and the decision-making 
capabilities. Such environments can collect a variety of data from 
different sources (i.e., objects/devices) and apply data fusion and 
mining techniques to leverage and analyse data gathered. Hence, data are 
then the base for making intelligent decisions and providing new services.
Nowadays, in the context of IoT-based smart environments, data 
management constitutes a modern and a hot topic and has raised many 
challenging research tasks. New solutions and revisited existing ones 
are proposed to address such tasks. The main goal of CI3DM’2020 is to 
provide an international forum for researchers from academia and 
industry to exchange ideas and experiences regarding current and future 
solutions for managing IoT data. Especially, solutions that leverage 
techniques borrowed from computational Intelligence field (Soft 
computing, Fuzzy logic, Uncertainty models, Neural networks, …).

Works in this field should address business, governmental and societal 
needs. With a holistic objective, it places humans at the epicentre of 
the digital transformation to unleash our collective potential, thus 
taking biological as well as artificial intelligence into account. 
Humans and institutions should have benefits of explained knowledge from 
the IoT data in the understandable ways, i.e., linguistically. Next, the 
promising field is focusing on nature inspired approaches in machine 
learning and computational intelligence for sustainability reasons, as 
nature-inspired approaches are not only more natural towards humanity 
but also more energy-efficient than today’s technology, which is the key 
factor when analysing huge amounts of IoT data. Our emerging, symbiotic 
technology thus should intend people to support a life in harmony with 
each other as well as with Nature.

Workshop main topics:

limited to) one or more of the following topics:

Miljan Vu?eti?, VLATACOM Institute of High Technologies, Serbia
Rubén González Crespo, Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, Spain
Martin Št?pni?ka, University of Ostrava, Czech Republic
Jose Alonso, CSITI, University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain


Expected numbers of submissions: up to 12.

Expected number of accepted papers: 5 -10 papers.

Description of paper review process and acceptance standards:
All submissions will be reviewed by at least two reviewers who have the 
required expertise of the scope of the workshop. The review criteria 
considered are the novelty and originality of the paper, the quality of 
research methodology, the organization and clarity, the reference to 
prior work, and the quality of results.
       A number of reviewers are identified according to their degree of 
confidence and expertise in the fields related to the workshop. Then, a 
simultaneous mailing is sent to all identified reviewers. Each reviewer 
must select a number of submitted papers according to his research 
domains and interests. Received submissions will be assigned to the 
reviewers based on their preferences.
       The Program Committee coordinates the reviews and the received 
reviewers’ comments. In case of tie in reviewers' recommendations, one 
of the committee members will review the paper, to accelerate the 
decision process.
Finally, notifications about acceptance or rejection of papers are sent 
to all authors.

Instructions for Submission:
The deadline for the paper submission is April 20, 2020. However, the 
potential contributors are requested to send at their earliest 
convenience an e-mail message, addressed to workshop organizers, 
confirming the intent to submit a paper and giving its tentative title 
and a list of the authors.
     Submitted papers must comply with the RTIS’2020 submission 
(https://rtis2020.sigappfr.org/). The accepted papers will be published 
in the main conference proceedings.

Journal Special Issue:
Selected papers from the CI2DM Workshop will be invited to submit an 
extended version to The International Journal of Interactive Multimedia 
and Artificial Intelligence  (IJIMAI) https://www.ijimai.org/journal/
