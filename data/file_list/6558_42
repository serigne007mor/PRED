 CALL FOR PAPERS - NLDB'2014

 19th International Conference on Application of Natural Language to 
 Information Systems

 18-20 June 2014 - Montpellier, France

 http://www.nldb.org/

 Submission deadline: February 3, 2014

 ==============

 Since 1995, the NLDB conference aims at bringing together researcher, 
 industrials and potential users interested in various application of 
 Natural Language in the Database and Information Systems field. The 
 integration of databases and natural language has been an utopia for 
 many years. However, progress has been made and this is now an 
 established field thanks to developments in Natural Language and 
 technologies that made the storage and manipulation of large electronic 
 dictionaries possible. As Information Systems are now evolving into the 
 communication area, the term databases should be considered in the 
 broader sense of information and communication systems. The use of 
 Natural Language in Software Engineering has contributed to both 
 improving the development process from the viewpoints of developers 
 (improve the process of conceptual modeling, validation, etc) and the 
 usability of applications by users (natural language query interfaces, 
 semantic webs, etc).

 NLDB'2014 will take place in Montpellier (France). The conference 
 invites researchers from academia and industry to submit papers for oral 
 or poster presentations on recent, unpublished research that addresses 
 theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures for applied 
 and integrated NLP, resources for applied NLP, and other aspects of NLP, 
 as well as review and discussion papers.

 Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
 - Applications of NLP in Information Systems: Multilingual Information 
 Systems, NLP in Requirement Engineering, NLP in Knowledge Management, 
 Semantic Data Integration and Data Cleaning
 - Social Media and Web Data: Corpus analysis, Language identification, 
 Text normalization, Robust NLP for social media, Text classification, 
 Information Extraction and Sentiment Analysis for social media
 - Big Data and Natural Language
 - Semantic Web Open Linked Data: Ontology Learning and Alignment, 
 Populating ontologies, Querying Ontologies and linked data, Semantic 
 tagging and classification, Ontology-driven NLP
 - Question Answering (QA): NL interfaces to databases, QA using web 
 data, multi-lingual QA, Non-factoid QA (how/why/opinion questions, 
 lists), geographical QA, QA corpora and training sets
 - Natural language and Ubiquitous Computing: Pervasive Computing, 
 Embedded, Robotic and Mobile Applications.
 - Natural Language in Conceptual Modeling: Analysis of Natural Language 
 Descriptions, Terminological Ontologies, Consistency Checking, Metadata 
 Creation and Harvesting, Ontology-driven Systems Integration, Ontology 
 Management
 - NLP Applications: Business Intelligence, Subjectivity and Sentiment 
 Analysis, QA systems, Event Detection, Named Entity and Event Detection, 
 Information Extraction, Summarization, NLP for Data Mining, NLP for Data 
 Warehouses, Plagiarism detection, Identity detection

 ==============

 Submission guidelines:
 Authors should follow the LNCS format and submit their manuscripts in 
 pdf. Submissions can be full papers (12 pages maximum including 
 references), short papers (6 pages) or papers for a poster presentation 
 (4 pages). The programme committee may decide to accept some full papers 
 as short papers or poster contributions.
 The Proceedings of NLDB 2014 will be published by Springer LNCS Series. 
 We plan to publish extended versions of a selection of the best papers 
 after the conference in the 'Data and Knowledge Engineering Journal' as 
 a special issue.
