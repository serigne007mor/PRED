Subject: [liste-egc] Mobility Summer School - Call for Participation and
 Flyer


Dear Colleague, Dear Student,

should you have an interest in mobility issues, we would be very 
pleased to welcome you at the summer school we are offering on the 
topic.

A number of grants are available to nearly cover the local costs for 
your participation.

Please consider joining.

Feel free to forward this email to whoever may be interested, in 
particular other PhD students and postdocs.

Looking forward to meet you in Leysin.

Stefano Spaccapietra

2nd MODAP-MOVE Summer School on Privacy-aware Social Mining

http://mss2012.modap.org/

Leysin, Switzerland, July 1-6, 2012

Co-organized by the FP7/ICT project MODAP "Mobility, Data Mining and 
Privacy" and
the COST Action IC0903 MOVE "Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects".
Supported by the FP7/Marie Curie project SEEK and by Swiss-CUSO

Deadline for grant application: April 25 -  Grant notification: May 4  -
Deadline for registration: 15 May, 2012
==========================================================
Mobility is on everybody's lips in our computer science community, 
and beyond. It is one of the major keywords that characterize the 
current development of our society. People, goods, and ideas are 
moving faster and more frequently than ever. All services are getting 
as mobile as their customers. Be it for the development of 
contextualized information services (e.g. location-based systems) or 
the capture, management and exploitation of movement data (generated 
via the use of GPS, sensors, RFIDs, cellphones, smartphones, and 
alike), mobility is a hot topic with plenty of possibilities for 
innovative research.
Several research communities are investigating new techniques 
suitable for extracting meaningful knowledge from tracks of moving 
objects enriched with contextual data, with the goal to enable a 
richer use of movement data. While previous research focused on 
cleaning and processing the data received from sensors, GPS devices 
and alike, to produce better movement tracks, recent research rather 
focuses on methods to enrich movement tracks with more semantic, 
application-oriented information. Hot privacy concerns apply to human 
mobility tracks. To what extent can we develop techniques that 
guarantee no disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized 
persons? How can the new techniques cope with the fact that the level 
of sensitivity of information may depend on many different factors, 
including where and when the information is accessed, whose 
information it is, and who is requesting access.
This summer school provides an intensive training opportunity to 
learn the essentials of recent research on of mobility data 
management while exploring other related domains that tomorrow will 
contribute in advancing the state of art in mobility techniques. The 
school targets doctoral students and young postdocs as well as a 
small number of senior researchers working on database management, 
machine learning, data mining, GIS, statistics, law informatics, etc. 
To benefit from optimal training conditions, the school is based on 
limited attendance. Please send your application form as soon as 
possible.

The registration fee is a fixed rate (from 550 to 710 euros) that 
covers all expenses directly related to the participation to the 
school for the whole period of the school. A number of grants are 
available to facilitate the participation of students to the Summer 
School. The procedure for grant applications can be found at 
http://mss2012.modap.org
