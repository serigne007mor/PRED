Summary

Computational simulation provides an inexpensive and time efficient =
means of carrying out what-if scenarios and studies into alternative =
strategies for a given situation. Furthermore, it enables investigations =
and predictions into how the complex dynamics of a real-world system are =
likely to be affected by changes to internal and/or external factors. =
Over the past two decades, the development and application of =
computational simulation models has been seen at a rapidly increasing =
rate in a wide range of domains. Crisis and Disaster Management (CDM) is =
one domain in which this has been witnessed, driven by the significant =
increase in the number of large-scale and unprecedented emergency =
situations, and the need to better manage them and lessen their impact. =
These include areas such as pandemics, forest fires, floods, fatal =
industrial injuries, and wide-scale population movements (e.g., =
refugees).

Computational simulation of natural and man-made crises and disasters =
offers opportunities to bring together stakeholders, including academics =
and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds, in the design and =
implementation of realistic models applicable to the various stages of =
the emergency management life cycle (preparation, response, mitigation =
and recovery). Such collaborative efforts have delivered great benefits =
via sophisticated computational simulation models. Indeed, these models =
have improved trustworthiness, usefulness, usability, and validity. =
Their application has seen a growing acceptance and relevance, thus =
leveraging their results to make a practical difference. Consequently, =
the simulation results produced can contribute to providing a sound =
basis for =E2=80=98better=E2=80=99 decisions regarding how to manage =
crises and disasters.

Questions of interest in this special issue include, but are not limited =
to, the following theoretical and applied questions for crisis and =
disaster management models:

How to incorporate realistic human behavior into CDM simulation models?

What methodologies can be used to develop models from real data? For =
example, by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to create =
realistic models of floods, forest fires, earthquakes, or evacuations; =
or by leveraging data from past disasters, field studies, or expert =
input, to identify relevant human behaviors.

How to improve the value of crisis and disaster simulators for =
decision-makers?

In which phases of the disaster management life-cycle (preparation, =
response, recovery and mitigation) can we use simulators?

What methods, techniques and approaches can be used in CDM simulation =
(e.g. agent-based, virtual reality, systems dynamics, participatory =
approaches)?

How to create hybrid CDM models by coupling modeling approaches (e.g., =
Agent-Based Models) with other tools (e.g., optimization, social media =
analytics)?

How to increase acceptability and trust in CDM simulation models?

How to combine micro (e.g. citizen behavior) and macro (e.g. crowd =
behavior, norms) level representations ? How do they influence each =
other? How do macro-level emerge from micro-level behaviors in the CDM =
context?

What kind of explanations and predictions can we draw from real CDM =
data?

How to validate CDM simulation models and deal with quality issues, such =
as robustness, scalability, efficiency, or reliability?

The goal of this special issue is to cover the breadth and depth of =
computer simulation for crisis response and management. Papers should =
address topical and real-world problems (e.g., pandemics, humanitarian =
crises, natural and man-made disasters) and should highlight the use of =
computer simulation for crisis situations. We welcome manuscripts that =
contribute to the questions of interest in the form of novel research =
methodologies, applications, reviews, or case studies. Papers should be =
up to a maximum of 15 pages (including references) and detail completed =
research, i.e. not work in progress.
