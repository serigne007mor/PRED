Subject: [liste-egc] PhD Offer: Linked Data Sanitization at LIFO/INSA Centre
 Val de Loire

Dear colleagues,

We are looking for a PhD candidate in Linked Data Sanitization at the
Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale d'Orl=C3=A9ans (LIFO) in Bourges, F=
rance
(details bellow).
Please forward to potential candidates.

Best Regards,

C=C3=A9dric Eichler

-----------------

The PhD is funded by the ANR (french national research agency) in the
context of the national SENDUP project. PhD will be co-supervised with the
Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble (LIG) and will start on September 1,
2019 (may be postponed upon candidates request until December). The
deadline for applications is May 30, 2019.


*Scientific Context:*

The  amount  of  data  produced  by  individuals  and  corporations  has
dramatically  increased  during  the last decades. This generalized
gathering of data brings opportunities (e.g., building new knowledge using
this =E2=80=9DBig Data=E2=80=9D) but also new privacy challenges.
The general public express a growing distrust over personal data
exploitation, which has been met with successive strengthened regulations
(e.g. EU general data protection regulation).
This has led to a growing interest for data sanitization, the art of
disclosing personal data without jeopardizing privacy, and data-set
anonymisation. An anonymized dataset is a dataset which is difficult,
costly, or impossible to relate to real individuals. Both domains aim to
maintain a certain data quality while ensuring privacy in order to produce
information as useful as possible.

The  LIFO  (Orl=C3=A9ans/Bourges)  and  LIG (Grenoble)  laboratories  are
working  on  an  innovative  ANR  project  for efficient sanitization and
anonymization for data stored as graphs with an underlying semantic (e.g.,
RDF).

*Objectives*:

The PhD applicant will integrate and collaborate with SENDUP=E2=80=99s team=
. Its
main objectives will be:
-introduce new knowledge- and usage-based utility metrics for graph
data-bases.
-introduce new privacy guaranties and metrics (e.g. k-anonymity,
differential privacy) for graph data-bases.
-contribute to the suite of software modules implementing the proposed
algorithms

*Requirements:*

- Master degree in Computer Science
- Fluent written and spoken English
- Good coding skills (java or C++)
- Autonomous and team working

Previous knowledge of topics related to knowledge management, and/or
privacy is an advantage.
Knowledge of French language is a plus, but not required. French courses
are offered to PhD students if they desire to learn French during their
thesis.

*Hosting institution and laboratory:*

The PhD applicant will integrate the Systems and Data Security team of the
Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale d'Orl=C3=A9ans (LIFO)
The host institution, INSA Centre Val de Loire, is located 88 boulevard
Lahitolle 18022 Bourges

*Application procedure*:

Please submit your application by email to C=C3=A9dric Eichler (
cedric.eichler@insa-cvl.fr), Benjamin Nguyen (benjamin.nguyen@insa-cvl.fr)
and Fr=C3=A9d=C3=A9ric Prost (frederic.prost@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr) before=
 May 30,
2019, including:
- cover letter
- CV
- copies of the relevant certificates
- list of references
- relevant publications, if exist.

For inquiries please contact C=C3=A9dric Eichler (cedric.eichler@insa-cvl.f=
r).
