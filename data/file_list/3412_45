** CALL FOR PAPERS **

** WORKSHOP **
6th International Workshop on Social Media World Sensors, Taipei, 20/21 =
 =

April 2020.
Held in conjunction with The Web Conference 2020Held in conjunction with=
  =

The Web Conference 2020.

** IMPORTANT DATES **

- Paper submission: December 16th, 2019
- Notification to authors: January 20th, 2020
- Camera-ready: February 17th, 2020
- Workshop date:  Aprile 20th-21th, 2020


** WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES **

Nowadays Social media platforms represent freely-accessible information =
 =

networks allowing registered and unregistered members to read, share and=
  =

broadcast posts, different in format and size, referring to a  =

potentially-unlimited range of topics, by also exploiting the  =

immediateness of handy smart devices. This workshop wants to stress the =
 =

vision of these powerful communication channels as social sensors, where=
  =

each user reacts in real time to the underlying reality by providing her=
  =

own interpretation of the reality that needs to be analysed, understood =
 =

and interpreted. Technologies on this connectivity may also provide  =

automatic or semi-automatic applications for information detection and  =

integration, offering a sideway to the existing authoritative informatio=
n  =

media and the information reported by the surrounding community.


** DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP **
Nowadays, online social media platforms have become the most popular  =

communication system all over the world. In fact, due to the accessibili=
ty  =

and the public of these platforms, users tend to shift from traditional =
 =

communication tools (such as traditional web sites) to these social  =

services. For example, 68 percent of U.S. adults get news on social medi=
a  =

in 2018, while in 2012, only 49 percent reported seeing news on social  =

media.  Billions of messages, in many different formats, are appearing  =

daily in these services such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. The  =

authors of these messages share content about any aspect of their life  =

(public or private), exchanging opinions on a variety of topics and  =

creating and discussing a wide range of events.

Companies like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have unlocked new ways fo=
r  =

people to connect, curate, and consume and also see the surrounding  =

reality. Social Media have changed and continue to change how we interac=
t  =

with the web - how content is distributed, discovered, and delivered. Th=
ey  =

provide inexpensive communication medium that allows anyone to quickly  =

reach and interact with many other users, modifying their point of view =
 =

and even their interpretation of the facts. Consequently, in these  =

platforms anyone can publish content and anyone interested in the conten=
t  =

can obtain it, representing a transformative revolution in our society. =
 =

These aspects make Social Media services the most powerful sensor for an=
y  =

possible interpretation of reality, by also bringing into question the  =

researchers in defining what reality means.  The aim of this workshop is=
  =

to ask researchers to enter into such view, by studying how Social Media=
  =

can be used in a real-time scenario to detect events and their  =

interpretations.

In light of this, we stress the importance of recognizing this real-time=
  =

sensor role of Social Media and propose a research venue to discuss abou=
t  =

it.
