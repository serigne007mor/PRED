Subject: [liste-egc] CFP - ICIKS 2021 (In cooperation with ACM- SIGAI &
 SIGMIS) June 22- 23, 2021 // Virtual Conference

5th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Systems (ICIKS 2021)

We invite you to submit a paper to ICIKS 2021 virtual conference June  
22-23, 2021

Conference URL : http://www.iciks.org/


The International Conference on Information and Knowledge Systems  
(ICIKS 2021) aims to gather both researchers and practitioners in the  
fields of Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge  
Management and Decision Support. ICIKS seeks to promote discussions on  
various organizational, technological, and socio-cultural aspects of  
research in the design and use of information and knowledge systems in  
organizations.
Considering the large amount of data, information, and knowledge  
created and used in the organizations, especially with the evolution  
of information and communications technology platforms, organizations  
under the process of digital transformation constantly search for  
innovative concepts and creative applications. More importantly, ICIKS  
aims beyond the predominant role of technologies, seeking discussions  
on the essential interactions between individuals, who are not only  
the ultimate technology users but also components of these systems.
Organizations must be aware of the importance of data, information,  
human being behavior, and knowledge owned by their members. Creating  
activities to enhance identification, preservation, and use of this  
knowledge is a powerful means to improve the level of the  
organizations’ performance. Thus, organizations must invest on human  
interactions. Since COVID-19 crisis, more and more of these  
interactions are made through digital information systems. This will  
insure better information and knowledge creation, transfer and  
preservation taking into account the security of socio-technical  
systems.
We encourage submission of research related to the design,  
implementation, and use of information and knowledge systems  
considering the cultural context of the organizations, and the  
viewpoints of their shareholders.
Researchers and practitioners are invited to share recent advances in  
methodologies, models and tools concerning decision processes and  
information and knowledge systems that contribute to the success of  
digital transformation in organizations.

Topics of interest will include, but are not limited to:

Knowledge sharing or transfer
Knowledge management
Knowledge management systems
Decision process in organizations
Decision support systems
Business process for information and knowledge systems
Evaluation and measurement of information and knowledge systems
Social and human factors in information and knowledge systems
Artificial intelligence for information and knowledge systems
Big data for information and knowledge systems
Ontology for information and knowledge systems
Security issues in information and knowledge systems
