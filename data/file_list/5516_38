Subject: [liste-egc] Reminder: Call for Papers - Workshop on interactive
 data mining (IDM) @ ECML PKDD

**One week left before the deadline!**

With more and more applications of machine learning and data mining method=
s to real-world problems, the necessity of understanding why those methods =
lead to certain results has also become more and more obvious=2E

The reasons for this need to understand are diverse: users might need to u=
nderstand because money is on the line =E2=80=94 as investment or profit =
=E2=80=94 or even lives, e=2Eg=2E in healthcare or disaster preparedness=2E=
 Or they might want to understand because computational methods can then ac=
t as hypothesis generators: observing the results of a pattern mining opera=
tion or a produced clustering triggers new insights and informs new researc=
h directions - the final step in the =E2=80=9Cknowledge discovery=E2=80=9D =
process=2E

There are also legal frameworks that require interpretability and explaina=
bility of algorithmic decisions, e=2Eg=2E the EU General Data Protection Re=
gulation or the US Fair Credit Reporting Act=2E In machine learning (ML), m=
ost of the focus has been on using symbolic representations of non-symbolic=
 models to help with explainability: =E2=80=9CWhy does the model give certa=
in predictions?=E2=80=9D=2E

Data mining, specifically pattern mining and clustering, is already largel=
y symbolic but lacks the label-provided supervision that can be leveraged i=
n ML=2E As such, there are two questions one needs to answer to understand =
data mining results: 1) =E2=80=9CHow did the algorithm arrive at the result=
?=E2=80=9D, and 2) =E2=80=9CWhat does this result mean w=2Er=2Et=2E the und=
erlying data?=E2=80=9D I=2Ee=2E, instead of explaining a result, one needs =
to understand a process and/or interpret a result=2E

The best way of answering these questions come from offering supervision i=
n the form of involving the user by making data mining interactive=2E This =
involvement gives the user a better understanding of how successive mining =
steps build on each other, helping with interpreting the final result, expl=
aining how the process arrived at it, and therefore building trust=2E Venue=
s for publishing work on understanding ML have been proliferated under the =
=E2=80=9Cexplainable AI=E2=80=9D (XAI) label whereas this remains an undere=
xplored topic for data mining=2E After the end of the =E2=80=9CInteractive =
Data Exploration and Analytics=E2=80=9D (IDEA) workshop series at KDD (2013=
=E2=80=932017),
opportunities for presenting on-going research have been rare=2E We theref=
ore intend to bring the topic back to ECML PKDD, host of the 2012 =E2=80=9C=
Instant Interactive Data Mining=E2=80=9D workshop, to take the temperature =
of the community on that topic, assemble work on progress on it, and in gen=
eral bring interested researchers together for exchange and discussion=2E

The workshop will take place virtually on September 23, 2022=2E

*Submissions*

We will solicit submissions including but not limited to the following top=
ics:
=E2=80=A2 Interactive pattern mining and clustering
=E2=80=A2 Human-in-the-loop data mining systems
=E2=80=A2 Result visualization
=E2=80=A2 Data mining feedback options
=E2=80=A2 User preference and constraint learning
=E2=80=A2 Subjective interestingness measures
=E2=80=A2 Use cases of interactive, explainable and interpretable data min=
ing
=E2=80=A2 Result sampling techniques

The following types of papers can be submitted:

- Long papers will be 9 pages of content and an unlimited number of refere=
nces in the Springer LNCS style and should report on novel, unpublished wor=
k that might not be quite mature enough for a conference or journal submiss=
ion=2E
- Extended abstracts will be 2 pages in Springer LNCS style and summarize =
recent publications fitting the workshops=2E
- Demo papers will be 5 pages in Springer LNCS and describe a concrete imp=
lementation of an interactive mining system=2E

Papers are to be submitted in pdf format at https://easychair=2Eorg/confer=
ences/?conf=3Didm22

Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committ=
ee on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity=
=2E Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper is accepted =
at least one author should present the paper at the workshop=2E Long papers=
 and extended abstract will be presented orally while demo papers will be d=
emoed=2E
