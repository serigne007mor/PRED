  Applied Ontology Journal : 10th Anniversary

/Applied Ontology/ celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Since its 
first issue published was by IOS Press in 2005, the journal has 
established itself as the leading academic source for interdisciplinary 
research on ontological analysis and conceptual modelling—carving out a 
previously unexplored research niche where what matters most is the 
/content/, not the representation. Since then, research on applied 
ontology has been acquiring more and more its own shape, to the point 
that—perhaps—a new science is emerging. For sure, we now can point to a 
body of accumulated results, in terms of formal theories, methodologies 
and experiences, which increasingly are forming a coherent whole.

We intend to celebrate the anniversary year of /Applied Ontology/ with a 
*special issue* aimed at an in-depth assessment of our research field 
and a visionary exploration of its future prospects.

We are therefore launching an open call for:

a. In-depth state-of-the-art papers focusing on current progress and on 
open challenges concerning specific ontological or conceptual modelling 
problems;
b. Broad survey papers focusing on important application perspectives, 
aimed at assessing the effectiveness of ontology-based techniques and/or 
methodologies;
c. Visionary papers addressing the future of ontology-based systems and 
the impact of ontologies and ontological analysis on technology and society
d. Short position papers on matters of general interest for the broad 
/Applied Ontology /community

All these papers will undergo a fast-track peer-review process, adhering 
to our usual quality standards. Thanks to the kind support of IOS Press, 
the five best papers falling into categories a, b, and c above will 
receive a *prize of $1000*, and they will be published in volume 10, 
issue 4 of /Applied Ontology/, together with the most relevant position 
papers. Space will be reserved in subsequent issues of the journal for 
any remaining papers considered to be suitable for publication.

*Deadlines*

To be considered for one of the prizes, papers falling in the categories 
a-b-c above should be submitted by *July 15, 2015*. To be considered for 
the special issue, position papers should be submitted by *October 1st, 
2015*.

*Submission instructions*

Authors are requested to submit their articles electronically following 
the instructions published at www.applied-ontology.org 
<http://www.applied-ontology.org>, clearly specifying in the 
accompanying letter that their paper is to be considered for the 
anniversary issue, as well as the category to which it belongs (a, b, c, 
or d). The maximum length for papers in categories a-b-c is 35 pages 
(double-spaced), while the maximum length for position papers is 10 
pages (double-spaced).

*Selection process and authorship constraints*

At the end of the usual peer-review process, the final selection *of the 
five best papers* will be performed by the /Applied Ontology/ associate 
editors. For this reason, any papers co-authored by associate editors of 
the journal (or their current trainees) will not be *eligible for being 
selected*. Apart from the restricted group of associate editors, all 
members of the /Applied Ontology/ Editorial Board are warmly invited to 
participate to this call. *Special consideration will be given to papers 
authored or co-authored by young researchers or by graduate students*.
