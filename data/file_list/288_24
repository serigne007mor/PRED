basic and experimental on Information Systems and Business Intelligence
(or economic intelligence (EI) in French
terminology) (SIIE). This promotes, in a risk environment, technologies
related to economic intelligence. The
dynamic of EI depends on the control of knowledge and requires
competences to design the best strategies and

- IGA (Marocco) and is sponsored by the
Higher Education Ministry of Marocco, (...), and IEEE.
The first three editions (2008, 2009 and 2010) have allowed academic
researchers and economic actors to achieve
completed projects. The goal of SIIE is to continue in this way by
creating opportunities, ideas and innovative ways
to enhance projects, and build connections between universities and
industries on both sides of the Mediterranean
sea.
SIIE'2011 includes lectures, tutorials, sessions and panels by experts,
to identify new approaches and knowledge in
economic intelligence, applied research and feedback. This will allow
the emergence of new clusters in competive
intelligence.
In a friendly framework, pleasant and cordial life context, the SIIE
conference has always been thought to promote
the weaving of trust networks between actors in academia, industry and
