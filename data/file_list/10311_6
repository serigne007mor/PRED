Dear Colleagues,
Sorry for multiple posting.


*4th International Conference on Computer Science and Its Applications**
**May 4-5, 2013**
**Saida, Algeria**
**
**http://ciia2013.dzportal.net/**
*

*Selected Papers will be invited to be Extended for the Following 
Special Issues:*

*1. International Journal of Data Mining, Modelling and Management 
(Inderscience)*
*2. International Journal of Computational Intelligence Studies 
(Inderscience)*
*3. International Journal of Reasoning-based Intelligent 
Systems (Inderscience)*
*4. International Journal of Web Science (Inderscience)*
*5. ...*


The fourth International Conference on Computer Science and its 
Applications (CIIA'2013) will be held from 4-5 may 2013 in Saida, 
Algeria as for the previous editions. The main objective of this 
conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research 
accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between 
different research communities related to computer science and its 
applications. CIIA'2013 will also provide an international platform for 
the presentation of research on Software Engineering, Distributed 
System, Computational Intelligence, Advanced Information Systems, 
Advanced Infrastructure design (distributed, parallel, cloud, grid 
computing, etc.), and technologies that can be developed in Algeria and 
Africa such as scalable and sustainable supply and distribution of 
energy, etc.  This international scientific event initiated by 
researchers from Algeria and extended to cover worldwide researchers 
aims at promoting the research in Africa, creating scientific networks, 
developing projects and facilitating faculty/student exchanges.
