IDA 2015 will feature two tracks: the regular Proceedings Track, as well 
as a
Horizon Track for early-stage research of potentially ground-breaking 
nature.

- Goal & Background
The Horizon Track is a fine-tuned version of last year's First Look Track.
It aims to provide a forum for potentially ground-breaking research that 
is however
not yet mature enough for archival dissemination. You may have a great 
idea that
needs to be investigated in more detail, or you may have a long-term 
vision that
you would like to share. In these cases, it may be impossible or 
undesirable to
publish a preliminary version of your paper in the proceedings, but 
presenting
and discussing it at IDA may be of interest to both you and the community.

- Call for Horizon presentations
To be considered for a Horizon Track presentation, you are required to 
submit a
title and a short abstract (<250 words) and optionally any other 
material (e.g.,
an extended abstract, a partial manuscript, a presentation, a movie, a 
website, ..)
that may help us to review the submission against the stated criteria. 
Titles and
abstracts of contributions accepted for the Horizon Track will be listed 
on the
website and included in the proceedings front matter, but any other 
material submitted
will be used for reviewing only, and will not be publicly divulged in 
any form.
Horizon Track contributions may be accepted for either oral or poster 
presentation.

- Do you prefer submitting a regular paper?
