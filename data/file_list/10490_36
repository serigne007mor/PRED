    PhD position / Sujet de thèse


  Ontology alignment and data interlinking evolution on the web of data

The linked data initiative aims at publishing structured and interlinked
data at web scale by using semantic web technologies [1]. These
technologies provide different languages for expressing data as graphs
(RDF), describing its organization through ontologies (OWL) and querying
it (SPARQL) [2].

Linked data facilitates the implementation of applications that reuse
data distributed on the web. Until now, the access to data on the web
relies on limited Web APIs which provide proprietary interfaces and data
formats. Programmers have then to build custom solution for each data
source [3].

To facilitates interoperability between application, data issued by
different providers has to be interlinked, i.e., the same entity in
different data sets must be identified. However, in a heterogeneous
system such as the web, there is no reason that two organizations (or
providers) make use of the same ontologies to express their data or use
the same key to identify entities.

One of the key challenge of linked data is to be able to deal with this
heterogeneity by discovering links across datasets [4], but also
alignments between ontologies. Until now these two problems have been
mainly studied separately, even if some linking approaches take
advantage of alignments and ontology matching methods uses common
instances to compare concept extensions.

In such a dynamic environment as the web, ontologies and data evolve,
and then ontology alignments and links between data have to evolve too.
Since alignments and links should not be recomputed each time a change
occurs, the semantic web needs methods that consider the evolution.

The goal of this PhD is to study how to evolve alignments and links when
ontologies and data change. The followed approach will have to consider
the dependency between ontology alignments and links between data. With
such an approach, it will be for instance possible to induce new
correspondences between ontology entities by using new links and/or
decide that some correspondences are not valid anymore. Respectively,
adding or removing correspondences will helps to validate (or
invalidate) links between instances by using the semantics of alignments.

Given the increasing size of datasets, another important aspect of the
work is to enable the scalability of the methods and tools by designing
efficient pruning and/or segmentation strategies.

The successful candidate is expected to consider these problems under
their theoretical and experimental aspects.
