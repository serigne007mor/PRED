MACLEAN: MAChine Learning for EArth ObservatioN
19 September 2022

KEY DATES
Paper submission deadline: June 23, 2022
Paper acceptance notification: July 16, 2022
Paper camera-ready deadline: Monday, July 30, 2022
Workshop date: Monday, September 19, 2022

CONTEXT
The huge amount of data currently produced by modern Earth Observation =
(EO) missions has raised up new challenges for the Remote Sensing =
communities. EO sensors are now able to offer (very) high spatial =
resolution images with revisit time frequencies never achieved before =
considering different kind of signals, e.g., multi-(hyper)spectral =
optical, radar, LiDAR and Digital Surface Models. In this context, =
modern machine learning techniques can play a crucial role to deal with =
such amount of heterogeneous, multi-scale and multi-modal data. Some =
examples of techniques that are gaining attention in this domain include =
deep learning, domain adaptation, semi-supervised approach, time series =
analysis and active learning. Even though the use of machine learning =
and the development of ad-hoc techniques are gaining increasing =
popularity in the EO domain, we can witness that a significant lack of =
interaction between domain experts and machine learning researchers =
still exists. The objective of this workshop is to supply an =
international forum where machine learning researchers and =
domain-experts can meet each other, in order to exchange, debate and =
draw short and long term research objectives around the exploitation and =
analysis of EO data via Machine Learning techniques. Among the =
workshop=E2=80=99s objectives, we want to give an overview of the =
current machine learning researches dealing with EO data, and, on the =
other hand, we want to stimulate concrete discussions to pave the way to =
new machine learning frameworks especially tailored to deal with such =
data.

SUBMISSION
We welcome original contributions, either theoretical or empirical, =
describing ongoing
projects or completed work. Contributions can be of two types: either =
short position
papers (up to 6 pages including references) or full research papers (up =
to 10 pages in-
cluding references). Papers must be written in LNCS format, i.e., =
accordingly to the
ECML-PKDD 2022 submission format. Accepted contributions will be made =
avail-
able electronically through the Workshop web page. Post-proceedings will =
be also
published on the CEUR-WS platform.
