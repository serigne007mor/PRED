Subject: [liste-egc] PhD grant to study what a good team and a good
 management is in online communities


Hello,

The iSchool, Telecom Bretagne (France) has a 3 years grant for a student
willing to do a PhD in France (it is the duration of PhD studies in
France). The grant is ~=801200 per month, which is quite comfortable for
Brest, with possibilities to teach (in English or in French) for an
extra =80300/month.

The research can be done in English.
Skill in management theory and in computing are expected.
A master degree is compulsory.

The subject is available here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8IfgmZdkcDKcVNWdFB3MzJxbnc/edit?usp=3Dsha=
ring

People interested can apply, emailing a r=E9sum=E9 before September, 2
to Nicolas.Jullien@telecom-bretagne.eu
They will be contacted after this date for further discussion if needed.

Feel free to diffuse this announce.

Thanks in advance,

Nicolas Jullien

Here is a summary of the subject:

Communities aiming at producing a certain kind of knowledge, or
=93epistemic communities=94, and doing so online, are viewed as central in
the generation of new, innovative knowledge, because the organizations
increasingly rely on virtual teams to produce knowledge, but also
because of the =94open-innovation=94 relationships they create with those
online communities. Echoing the research on (virtual) team, two points
are particularly studied : the composition of the teams and the
management (leadership) of these communities, but those points are not
jointly studied and are poorly related to the existing literature on
virtual team and leadership in management.
New data extraction and analysis capacities, notably those developed by
a previous project and multidisciplinary research teams make it possible
to go beyond the actual studies, jointly studying the impact of the
structure and of the leadership of the virtual groups on their
performance. This, in order to provide 1) the managers of the virtual
communities with metrics and tools (dashboards) to evaluate and monitor
the efficiency of those communities, but also 2) the Institute (and the
companies) with a better understanding of the new skills the employees
may develop to work in those teams. The case study will be Wikipedia.
