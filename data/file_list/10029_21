Call for Papers DISCOVERY SCIENCE 2012
(http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/ds-2012/index.html)

The 15th International Conference on Discovery Science (DS-2012) will  
be held in Lyon, France, on 29-31 October 2012.

DS-2012 will be collocated with ALT-2012, the 23rd International  
Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory. The two conferences will be  
held in parallel, and will share their invited talks.

Traditionally the proceedings of DS series  appear in the Lecture  
Notes in Artificial Intelligence Series by Springer-Verlag. In  
addition a special issue on Discovery Science is planned in a  
prestigious journal.

DS 2012 provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange  
of new ideas among researchers working in the area of Discovery  
Science. The scope of the conference includes the development and  
analysis of methods for automatic scientific knowledge discovery,  
machine learning, intelligent data analysis, theory of learning, as  
well as their application to knowledge discovery. Very welcome are  
papers that focus on dynamic and evolving data, models and structures.

Important dates are:
Full paper submission:   17th May, 2012 (tentative)
Author notification:     8th July, 2012 (tentative)
Camera-ready papers due: 20th July, 2012 (tentative)
Conference:              29-31 Oct. 2012

The DS-2012 Website is:
http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/ds-2012/index.html

Submissions

We invite submissions of research papers addressing all aspects of  
discovery science. We particularly welcome contributions that discuss  
the application of data analysis, data mining and other support  
techniques for scientific discovery including, but not limited to,  
biomedical, astronomical and other physics domains.

Papers may contain up to fifteen (15) pages and must be formatted  
according to the layout supplied by Springer-Verlag for the Lecture  
Notes in Computer Science series.
Submitted papers may not have appeared in or be under consideration  
for another workshop, conference or a journal, nor may they be under  
review or submitted to another forum during the DS 2012 review process.

An excellent student paper will be selected to receive the Carl Smith  
Award. The award carries a scholarship prize of 555 euros.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
    * Logic and philosophy of scientific discovery
    * Knowledge discovery, machine learning and statistical methods
    * Ubiquitous Knowledge Discovery
