CALL FOR PAPER

There is a growing interest in learning data topology, from theoretical 
results to real-world applications. Topological learning is an emerging 
field which is expected to bring new insights in all the areas of the 
data mining and knowledge discovery process.

Data mining and knowledge discovery (KDD), as stated in their early 
definition, can today be considered as stable fields with numerous 
efficient methods and studies that have been proposed to extract 
knowledge from data. In every data mining task, understanding the 
structure of multidimensional patterns, in supervised or unsupervised 
cases, is of fundamental importance. Topological learning aims at 
finding hidden structures (usually low-dimensional manifolds) in order 
to better understand and exploit data.

The aim of this workshop is to address issues related to the concepts of 
learning data topology. Our goal is to attract papers dealing with each 
step of this field. Actually, learning data topology within the KDD 
process implies to work on every step, starting from the pre-processing 
(e.g. structuring and organizing) to the visualization and 
interpretation of the results, via the data mining methods themselves.

There are still big practical and theoretical challenges dealing with 
data topology, among which: how to deal with noisy, high-dimensional, 
multi-scale or complex data (times series, images, graphs, trees, texts, 
etc.)? How to interpret and qualify the results? How to select the 
models complexity? How to design efficient algorithms with theoretical 
guarantees? When is topological learning beneficial against usual 
methods? Etc. Papers dealing with these issues and reporting 
applications on real data will be of fundamental interest for this 
emerging field, and will take high priority for the selection process. 
KDD fields which involve topological learning, include, but are not 
limited to:

    - Topology learning
    - Manifold learning
    - Spectral clustering and embedding
    - Spectral feature selection
    - Linear and non linear dimensionality reduction
    - Computational topology
    - Mathematical morphology
    - Geometric Inference
    - Topological learning and complex data
    - Applications and experience feedback
 
More and more people approach the field of topological learning from 
different and interesting angles. They come from various communities 
such as data mining, statistics, geometry, topology, physics, medicine 
or engineering. We believe that now is the right time to establish and 
enhance cross fertilization between these communities. During this 
workshop, researchers will have the opportunity to bring new ideas, 
discuss their experiences and contribute to the theoretical and 
practical maturation of topological learning.

The workshop will consist in a series of communications (oral 
presentations or poster). A reasonable time will be left for the 
discussion after each presentation. All the articles will be reviewed at 
least twice with a goal to improve their quality and give advice to the 
authors. A dedicated place will be given to the young researchers with a 
session (Position paper) grouping the work in progress in the various 
European teams. That can be the occasion for a PhD student or a young 
researcher to present his/her starting project. This session will be 
particularly significant for work on the beginning and the installation 
of research groups on shared topics. Demonstrations of research results 
could be associated with the poster presentations.
