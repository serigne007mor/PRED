*Context*

An ontology is well known to be the best way to represent knowledge in a
domain of interest. It is defined by Gruber and Guarino as =E2=80=9Can expl=
icit
specification of a conceptualization=E2=80=9D. It allows us to represent ex=
plicitly
and formally existing entities, their relationships, and their constraints
in an application domain. This representation is the most suitable and
beneficial way to solve many challenging problems related to the
information domain (e.g., knowledge representation, knowledge sharing,
knowledge reusing, automated reasoning, knowledge capitalizing, and
ensuring semantic interoperability among heterogeneous systems). Using
ontology has many advantages, among them we can cite ontology reusing,
reasoning, explanation, commitment, and agreement on a domain of discourse,
ontology evolution, mapping, etc. As a field of artificial intelligence
(AI), ontology aims at representing knowledge based on declarative and
symbolic formalization. Combining this symbolic field with computational
fields of IA such as Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Uncertainty
and Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), Computer Vision (CV),
Multi-Agent Systems (SMA) and Natural Languages Processing (NLP) is a
promising association. Indeed, ontological modeling plays a vital role to
help AI reduce the complexity of the studied domain and organizing
information inside it. It broadens AI=E2=80=99s scope allowing it to includ=
e any
data type as it supports unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data
format which enables smoother data integration. The ontology also assists
AI for the interpretation process, learning, enrichment, prediction,
semantic disambiguation, and discovery of complex inferences. Finally, the
ultimate goal of ontologies is the ability to be integrated into the
software to make sense of all information.

In the last decade, ontologies are increasingly being used to provide
background knowledge for several AI domains in different sectors (e.g.
energy, transport, health, banking, insurance, etc.). Some of these AI
domains are:

   -   Machine learning and deep learning: semantic data selection,
   semantic data pre-processing, semantic data transformation, semantic dat=
a
   prediction, semantic clustering correction of the outputs, semantic
   enrichment with ontological concepts, use the semantic structure for
   promoting distance measure, etc.
   -   Uncertainty and Probabilistic Graphical Models: learning PGM
   (structure or parameters) using ontologies, probabilistic semantic
   reasoning, semantic causality, probability, etc.
   -   Computer Vision: semantic image processing, semantic image
   classification, semantic object recognition/classification, etc.
   -   Blockchain: semantic transactions, interoperable blockchain systems,
   etc.
   -   Natural Language Processing: semantic text mining, semantic text
   classification, semantic role labeling, semantic machine translation,
   semantic question answering, ontology-based text summarizing, semantic
   recommendation systems, etc.
   -   Multi-Agent Systems and Robotics: semantic task composition, task
   assignment, communication, cooperation, coordination, plans, and
   plannification, etc.
   -   Voice-video-speech: semantic voice recognition, semantic speech
   annotation, etc.
   -   Game Theory: semantic definition of specific games, semantic rules
   and goals definition, etc.
   -   etc.

*Objective*

This workshop aims at highlighting recent and future advances on the role
of ontologies and knowledge graphs in different domains of AI and how they
can be used in order to reduce the semantic gap between the data,
applications, machine learning process, etc., in order to obtain
semantic-aware approaches. In addition, the goal of this workshop is to
bring together an area for experts from industry, science, and academia to
exchange ideas and discuss the results of ongoing research in ontologies
and AI approaches.

<p><b><span>Objective<span></span></span></b></p>

<p><span>This workshop aims at highlighting recent and future advances on t=
he
role of ontologies and knowledge graphs in different domains of AI and how =
they
can be used in order to reduce the semantic gap between the data, applicati=
ons,
machine learning process, etc., in order to obtain semantic-aware approache=
s.
In addition, the goal of this workshop is to bring together an area for exp=
erts
from industry, science, and academia to exchange ideas and discuss the resu=
lts
of ongoing research in ontologies and AI approaches.<span></span></span></p=
