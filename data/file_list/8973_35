Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence
 (KDBI - EPIA2011)

Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence (KDBI - EPIA2011) thematic 
track
of the 15th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence  (EPIA 2011)
Lisbon, Portugal, 2011. Web-page: http://epia2011.appia.pt
>> Deadline for paper submission: May 10, 2011 <<

Due to advances in Information and Communication technologies, nowadays 
it is easy to collect, store, process and share data. In effect, the 
amount of data that is stored by organizations or individuals is 
exponentially growing. Moreover, business organizations are increasingly 
moving towards decision-making processes that are based on information. 
Therefore, the pressure to extract as much useful information as 
possible from these data is very strong. Knowledge Discovery (KD) is a 
branch of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field that aims to extract 
useful and understandable high-level knowledge from complex and/or large 
volumes of data. On the other hand, Business Intelligence (BI) is an 
umbrella term that represents computer architectures, tools, 
technologies and methods to enhance managerial decision-making in public 
and corporate enterprises, from operational to strategic level.

KD and BI are faced with new challenges. For example, due to the 
Internet expansion, huge amounts of data are available through the Web. 
Also, objects of analysis exist in time and space, often under dynamic 
and unstable environments, evolving incrementally over time. Another KD 
challenge is the integration of background knowledge (e.g. cognitive 
models or inductive logic) into the learning process. In addition, AI 
plays a crucial role in BI, providing methodologies to deal with 
prediction, optimization and adaptability to dynamic environments, in an 
attempt to offer support to better (more informed) decisions. In effect, 
several AI techniques can be used to address these problems, namely 
KD/Data Mining, Evolutionary Computation and Modern Optimization, 
Forecasting, Neural Computing and Intelligent Agents.

Hence, the aim of this workshop is to gather the latest research in KD 
and BI. Papers that describe experience and lessons learned from KD/BI 
projects and/or present business and organizational impacts using AI 
technologies, are welcome. Finally, we encourage papers that deal with 
the interaction with the end users, taking into account how easily one 
can understand data model's representation of extracted knowledge or 
encode expert knowledge, as well as its impact on real organizations.

Topics of Interest (non exhaustive): 1.	Knowledge Discovery (KD): - Data 
Pre-Processing; - Intelligent Data Analysis;
- Temporal and Spatial KD;
- Data and Knowledge Visualization;
- Machine Learning (e.g. Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Bayesian 
Learning, Inductive and Fuzzy Logic) and Statistical Methods;
- Hybrid Learning Models and Methods: Using KD methods and Cognitive 
Models, Neuro-Symbolic Systems, etc.
- Domain KD: Learning from Heterogeneous, Unstructured (e.g. text) and 
Multimedia data, Networks, Graphs and Link Analysis;
- Data Mining: Classification, Regression, Clustering and Association 
Rules; - Ubiquitous Data Mining: Distributed Data Mining, Incremental 
Learning, Change Detection, Learning from Ubiquitous Data Streams;
2.	Business Intelligence (BI): - Methodologies, Architectures or 
Computational Tools;
- Artificial Intelligence (e.g. KD, Evolutionary Computation, 
Intelligent Agents, Logic) applied to BI: Data Warehouse, OLAP, Data 
Mining, Decision Support Systems, Adaptive BI, Web Intelligence and 
Competitive Intelligence.
3.	Real-word Applications: Prediction/Optimization in Finance, 
Marketing, Medicine, Sales, Production.

Paper submission
All submissions will be refereed and selected for presentation at the 
conference on the basis of quality and relevance to the KDBI issues. 
Authors should omit their names from the submitted papers, and should 
take reasonable care to avoid indirectly disclosing their identity.
Papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be 
formatted according to the information for LNCS authors. Papers must be 
submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format and will not 
be accepted in any other format. Papers that exceed 15 pages or do not 
follow the LNCS guidelines risk being rejected automatically without a 
review. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the 
conference. More information about the Springer's Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science (LNCS) are available on the Springer LNCS Web site.
