PAPER SUBMISSION

The organizers of ADBIS 2021 invite original papers (not submitted in 
elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to both 
theory and practice of databases and information systems. The 
aforementioned list of topics is not exhaustive and we welcome novel 
results addressing topics not included in the list.

The page limits are as follows: (1) full research papers – 14 LNCS style 
pages, (2) short – 10 LNCS style pages.

Papers must be submitted via Easy Chair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adbis2021


Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their 
proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation 
of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in 
their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, 
acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and 
sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the 
copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the 
paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to 
the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
