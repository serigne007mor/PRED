An Information Extraction Platform For Ontology Engineering

The Orpailleur team offers a 1-year post-doctoral position in Nancy, France=
, starting in Autumn 2014. This project aims at improving existing tools an=
d developing a complete platform of information extraction that annotates t=
exts in an rdf (or similar) format. The result of this process should be us=
ed to build an ontology but this is out of the scope of this project. Howev=
er, in order to fulfill requirements coming from the ontological level, the=
 EI process may be progressively improved, i.e. discovering new entities, n=
ew features or new relations. Thus, experts that guide the process should b=
e able to interact with the IE platform and apply some data mining tools an=
d machine learning methods to identify new feature of interest.

Candidates applying for this position should have a PhD in Computer Science=
s with a good background in Natural Language Processing and Information Ext=
raction. Knowledge about Data Mining and Machine Learning would be greatly =
appreciated. In addition, abilities and experience in programming in C, C++=
 or Java are wished. This work comes within the scope of the "Hybride ANR P=
roject" which aims at extracting from PubMed texts some knowledge about rar=
es diseases. The candidate will have to work jointly with another post-doc =
researcher on Formal Concept Analysis that will be in charge of conceptuali=
zing the ontology.

LORIA lab is located in Nancy, East of France. It is among the largest comp=
uter science research laboratories in France involving several research org=
anizations such as CNRS, INRIA Nancy Grand Est and Lorraine University. It =
is a very large and challenging research environment with 29 research teams=
 and excellent computing facilities. Working languages are French or Englis=
h.
