Introduction

Advances in telecommunications, IT technologies and emerging security chall=
enges have produced a field=E2=80=94network security technologies=E2=80=94t=
o deal with the art, the knowledge, methodologies and techniques from diver=
se areas including cryptography and network communication and protocols. As=
 a field, network security technologies is devoted to solving security prob=
lems in a systematic way in order to ensure security of software and commun=
ication functionalities at basic, enhanced, integrated, and architectural l=
evels.

Objective of the Book

This book will aim to provide relevant theoretical frameworks and the lates=
t empirical research findings in network security technologies. It will be =
written for professionals who want to improve their understanding of the st=
rategic role of trust at different levels of the information and knowledge =
society, including trust at the level of the global economy, of networks an=
d organizations, of teams and work groups, of information systems and, fina=
lly, trust at the level of individuals as actors in the networked environme=
nts.

The book will cover the latest knowledge and technologies used and applied =
in network security. Also, it will analyze malicious threats, viruses, and =
attacks which can compromise network integrity at hardware or software leve=
ls.

Target Audience

The target audience of this book will be composed of professionals and rese=
archers working in the field of information and knowledge management in var=
ious disciplines, e.g. library, information and communication sciences, adm=
inistrative sciences and management, education, adult education, sociology,=
 computer science, and information technology. Moreover, the book will prov=
ide insights and support to executives concerned with the management of exp=
ertise, knowledge, information and organizational development in different =
types of work communities and environments.

Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:





Network and Wireless Network Security
Security for emerging technologies: sensor networks, wireless/mobile (and a=
d hoc) networks, and personal communication systems
Peer-to-Peer Network Security
Ubiquitous Computing Security
Cryptographic protocols
Performance Evaluations of Protocols & Security Application
Security for Cloud Computing
Applying Trustworthy Computing Mechanisms to secure network protocols and d=
istributed systems
Submission Procedure

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before September =
28, 2012, an 8,000-10,000 word chapter related to the above topics. Please =
query for chapter guidelines and topic approval. All submitted chapters wil=
