CALL FOR PAPERS

*

Workshop on Conceptual design for Internet of Robotic Things (CD4IoRT)

To be held in conjunction with ER 2023 (https://er2023.inesc-id.pt)

November 6-9 2023

Lisbon, Portugal

https://pros.unicam.it/cd4iort <https://pros.unicam.it/cd4iort>

** GENERAL INFORMATION and GOAL OF THE WORKSHOP **

The objective of the First Workshop on Conceptual Desing for Internet of 
Robotic Things (CD4IoRT)is to foster the use of conceptual design in the 
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) domain. Thanks to the advantages 
brought into everyday human life, IoRT systems have emerged as key 
technologies with a wide range of applications, in many application 
domains, e.g., agriculture, manufacturing, industry, domotics, and 
health. However, the implementation and management of these systems 
require a broad set of skills. This knowledge gap can be closed by novel 
conceptual modeling and engineering approaches specific to these 
software systems. The workshop aims to be a point of contact for 
practitioners and researchers from Conceptual Modeling with other 
communities such as Software Engineering, Databases, Business Process 
Management, Distributed Systems, Formal Methods, and Information Systems 
where creating a dialogue centered on the development of scientific 
foundations in this topic. The workshop will foster the discussion of 
research works case studies, experiences, and industry showcases in 
order to set up joint activities and future research directions.

*


*

** LIST OF TOPICS **

We seek contributions covering all aspects of data modeling for IoRT 
data applications including, but not limited to, the following topics:

*
*

   *

     Conceptual modeling and languages for IoRT data
