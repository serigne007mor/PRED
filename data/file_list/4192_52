About DSAA'2023
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----------
The 10th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analyti=
cs (DSAA)=20
features its strong interdisciplinary synergy between statistics (via ASA),=
 computing and=20
information/intelligence sciences (via IEEE and ACM), and cross-domain inte=
ractions between=20
academia and business for data science and analytics. DSAA sets up a high s=
tandard for its=20
organizing committee, keynote speeches, submissions to main conference and =
special sessions,=20
and a competitive rate for paper acceptance. DSAA has been widely recognize=
d as a dedicated=20
flagship annual meeting in data science and analytics such as by the Google=
 Metrics and China=20
Computer Foundation. DSAA=E2=80=992023 provides a premier forum that brings=
 together researchers,=20
industry and government practitioners, as well as developers and users of b=
ig data solutions=20
for the exchange of the latest theoretical developments in Data Science and=
 the best practice=20
for a wide range of applications. DSAA=E2=80=992023 invites submissions of =
papers describing innovative=20
research on all aspects of data science and advanced analytics as well as a=
pplication-oriented=20
papers that make significant, original, and reproducible contributions to i=
mproving the practice=20
of data science and analytics in real-world scenarios.

Research Track
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------
The Research Track solicits the latest, original and significant contributi=
ons related to=20
foundations and theoretical developments of Data Science and Advanced Analy=
tics. Topics of=20
interest include but are not limited to:

* Data science foundations and theories
* Mathematics and statistics for data science and analytics
* Understanding data characteristics and complexities
* Machine/deep/statistical learning-based algorithms
* Advanced analytics and knowledge discovery methods
* Computer vision and pattern recognition
* Optimization theories and methods
* Large-scale databases, big-data processing, distributed processing, and e=
thical analytics
* Model explainability and provenance
* Theories and methods for evaluation, explanation, visualization, and pres=
entation
* Survey and review


Location
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------
DSAA=E2=80=992023 will take place at the Grand Hotel Palace in Thessaloniki=
, Greece, the largest 5-star=20
conference hotel in Thessaloniki. It is located at a central point at the e=
ntrance of the city and=20
has a total capacity of 258 rooms and suites in modern or classic style dis=
tributed on the six=20
floors of the neoclassical building of unique architecture. Grand Hotel Pal=
ace is the biggest=20
Conference Hotel in Thessaloniki with 13 elegant and multi-purpose conferen=
ce halls & meeting=20
rooms. The mission of the people of Grand Hotel Palace is to offer high aes=
thetic hospitality in=20
a luxurious and comfortable environment. Learning more about the conference=

Paper Submission
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------
All papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair (under the =E2=
=80=9CResearch=E2=80=9D Track).

The length of each paper submitted to the Research tracks should be no more=
 than ten (10)=20
pages and should be formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter s=
tyle of IEEE=20
Conference template. For further information and instructions, see the IEEE=
 Proceedings Author=20
Guidelines.

All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basi=
s of technical quality
, relevance to the conference=E2=80=99s topics of interest, originality, si=
gnificance, and clarity. Author=20
names and affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographi=
c references must be=20
adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with p=
aper formatting and=20
authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.

Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have =
been issued as=20
technical reports or similar cannot be considered for DSAA=E2=80=992023. An=
 exception to this rule applies=20
to arXiv papers that were published in arXiv at least a month prior to DSAA=
=E2=80=992023 submission=20
deadline. Authors can submit these arXiv papers to DSAA provided that the s=
ubmitted paper=E2=80=99s title=20
and abstract are different from the one appearing in arXiv.


Proceedings and Indexing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------
All accepted poster papers will be published by IEEE in the DSAA main confe=
rence proceedings=20
under the Industry and Student Poster schemes. All accepted poster papers w=
ill be submitted for=20
inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The conference proceedings wi=
ll be submitted for EI=20
indexing through INSPEC by IEEE.


Important Policies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------
1. Reproducibility & supplementary: The advancement of data science depends=
 heavily on=20
reproducibility. We strongly recommend that the authors release their code =
and data to the public.=20
Authors can provide an optional two (2) page supplement at the end of their=
 submitted paper (it=20
needs to be in the same PDF file and start at page 3). This supplement can =
only be used to include=20
(i) information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported=
 in the paper (e.g., various=20
algorithmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper-parameter search=
 spaces, details=20
related to dataset filtering and train/test splits, software versions, deta=
iled hardware configuration,=20
etc.), and (ii) any data, pseudo-code and proofs that due to space limitati=
ons, could not be included=20
in the main manuscript.

2. Authorship: The list of authors at the time of submission is final and c=
annot be changed.

3. Dual submissions: DSAA is an archival publication venue as such submissi=
ons that have been=20
previously published, accepted, or are currently under-review at peer-revie=
w publication venues (i.e.,=20
journals, conferences, workshops with published proceedings, etc.) are not =
permitted. DSAA has a=20
strict no dual submission policy.

4. Conflicts of interest (COI): COIs must be declared at the time of submis=
sion. COIs include=20
employment at the same institution at the time of submission or in the past=
 three years, collaborations=20
during the past three years, advisor/advisee relationships, plus family and=
 close friends. Program=20
chairs and Industry Poster chairs are not allowed to submit papers to the I=
ndustry Poster track.

5. Attendance: At least one author of each accepted poster paper must regis=
ter in full and attend the=20
conference to present the poster. No-show posters will be removed from the =
IEEE Xplore proceedings.

------------------------------------<br>The 10th IEEE International Confere=
nce on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA) <br>features its strong i=
nterdisciplinary synergy between statistics (via ASA), computing and <br>in=
formation/intelligence sciences (via IEEE and ACM), and cross-domain intera=
ctions between <br>academia and business for data science and analytics. DS=
AA sets up a high standard for its <br>organizing committee, keynote speech=
es, submissions to main conference and special sessions, <br>and a competit=
ive rate for paper acceptance. DSAA has been widely recognized as a dedicat=
ed <br>flagship annual meeting in data science and analytics such as by the=
 Google Metrics and China <br>Computer Foundation. DSAA=E2=80=992023 provid=
es a premier forum that brings together researchers, <br>industry and gover=
nment practitioners, as well as developers and users of big data solutions =
<br>for the exchange of the latest theoretical developments in Data Science=
 and the best practice <br>for a wide range of applications. DSAA=E2=80=992=
023 invites submissions of papers describing innovative <br>research on all=
 aspects of data science and advanced analytics as well as application-orie=
nted <br>papers that make significant, original, and reproducible contribut=
ions to improving the practice <br>of data science and analytics in real-wo=
rld scenarios.<br><br>Research Track<br>-----------------------------------=
----------------------------------------------------<br>The Research Track =
solicits the latest, original and significant contributions related to <br>=
foundations and theoretical developments of Data Science and Advanced Analy=
tics. Topics of <br>interest include but are not limited to:<br><br>* Data =
science foundations and theories<br>* Mathematics and statistics for data s=
cience and analytics<br>* Understanding data characteristics and complexiti=

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----<br>All papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair (under =
the =E2=80=9CResearch=E2=80=9D Track).<br><br>The length of each paper subm=
itted to the Research tracks should be no more than ten (10) <br>pages and =
should be formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IE=
EE <br>Conference template. For further information and instructions, see t=
he IEEE Proceedings Author <br>Guidelines.<br><br>All submissions will be b=
lind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality<br=
>, relevance to the conference=E2=80=99s topics of interest, originality, s=
ignificance, and clarity. Author <br>names and affiliations must not appear=
 in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be <br>adjusted to p=
reserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with paper formatti=
ng and <br>authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.<br><br>Becau=
se of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have been =
issued as <br>technical reports or similar cannot be considered for DSAA=E2=
=80=992023. An exception to this rule applies <br>to arXiv papers that were=
 published in arXiv at least a month prior to DSAA=E2=80=992023 submission =
<br>deadline. Authors can submit these arXiv papers to DSAA provided that t=
he submitted paper=E2=80=99s title <br>and abstract are different from the =
one appearing in arXiv.<br><br><br>Proceedings and Indexing<br>------------=
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
<br>All accepted poster papers will be published by IEEE in the DSAA main c=
onference proceedings <br>under the Industry and Student Poster schemes. Al=
l accepted poster papers will be submitted for <br>inclusion in the IEEE Xp=
lore Digital Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for EI <=
br>indexing through INSPEC by IEEE.<br><br><br>Important Policies<br>------=
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------<br>1. Reproducibility &amp; supplementary: The advancement of data s=
cience depends heavily on <br>reproducibility. We strongly recommend that t=
he authors release their code and data to the public. <br>Authors can provi=
de an optional two (2) page supplement at the end of their submitted paper =
(it <br>needs to be in the same PDF file and start at page 3). This supplem=
ent can only be used to include <br>(i) information necessary for reproduci=
ng the experimental results reported in the paper (e.g., various <br>algori=
thmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper-parameter search space=
s, details <br>related to dataset filtering and train/test splits, software=
 versions, detailed hardware configuration, <br>etc.), and (ii) any data, p=
seudo-code and proofs that due to space limitations, could not be included =
<br>in the main manuscript.<br><br>2. Authorship: The list of authors at th=
e time of submission is final and cannot be changed.<br><br>3. Dual submiss=
ions: DSAA is an archival publication venue as such submissions that have b=
een <br>previously published, accepted, or are currently under-review at pe=
er-review publication venues (i.e., <br>journals, conferences, workshops wi=
th published proceedings, etc.) are not permitted. DSAA has a <br>strict no=
 dual submission policy.<br><br>4. Conflicts of interest (COI): COIs must b=
e declared at the time of submission. COIs include <br>employment at the sa=
me institution at the time of submission or in the past three years, collab=
orations <br>during the past three years, advisor/advisee relationships, pl=
us family and close friends. Program <br>chairs and Industry Poster chairs =
are not allowed to submit papers to the Industry Poster track.<br><br>5. At=
tendance: At least one author of each accepted poster paper must register i=
n full and attend the <br>conference to present the poster. No-show posters=
 will be removed from the IEEE Xplore proceedings.<br><br><br>Inquiries<br>=
