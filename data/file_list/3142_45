*Title: **Distributed link prediction in large complex graphs: application
to biomolecule interactions *

*Location: *Inria Nancy - Grand Est research centre =E2=80=93 LORIA, Nancy,=
 France

*Closing date:* Applications will be evaluated starting from May 5, 2019.

*Project-team: *CAPSID

* Context and positioning:*

Today, vast and diverse sources of data exist for almost every scientific
domain, making their integration and intelligent exploitation challenging.
Indeed, complex data require expressive data representation models such as
graph representation. The Linked Open Data (LOD) movement along with the
FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) data
principles are intended to facilitate heterogeneous data integration and
analyses. In the LOD context, graphs are called knowledge graphs as they
encompass domain ontologies for typing objects and describing their
relationships. Semantic web languages (RDFS, OWL, SPARQL) have reached an
interesting level of maturity on which ambitious machine learning
techniques can rely. Interestingly, big data and NoSQL solutions make
possible web-scale data analyses. So far, such analyses on dedicated
big-data architectures are often limited to MapReduce scenarios on rather
simple data models (key-value oriented, homogeneous graphs with only one
type of nodes and one type of edges). Graph databases, as one NoSQL
approach, allow for rich representation of multi-typed attributed nodes and
edges. This better expressivity comes with a cost as graph and program
distribution is not an easy task.

The objective of this PhD project is to make progress to the state of the
art of link prediction problem in knowledge graphs in a distributed setting
[1][2][3] in the context of predicting drug-target associations. Predicting
new targets for known drug molecules (often called drug repositioning [5])
offers the possibility of using existing drug molecules in new ways, which
is far cheaper and much less time-consuming than developing new drug
molecules from scratch. However, the computational challenge here is to
make link prediction algorithms capable to take into account the existence
of attributes and labels on both nodes and edges in knowledge graphs. The
proposed approaches will be evaluated using web-scale knowledge graphs for
inferring missing links (data completion). YAGO, DBpedia, and synthetic
benchmarks are usable for such evaluation and validation purposes [4].

*Missions: *
This PhD thesis project aims to develop scalable link prediction methods in
large and complex graphs. More specifically, the aims of this thesis
project are:


   - to propose link prediction approaches in knowledge graphs based on
   both graph topology and neighborhood constraints to be defined;
   - to design scalable implementations of the proposed approaches for
   distributed architectures. In this context, the use of big graph process=
ing
   frameworks such as Pregel, Trinity, GraphLab and BLADYG need to be studi=
ed
   [6];
   - to define evaluation and validation protocols for the proposed
   algorithms in the context of web-scale knowledge graphs;
   - to apply the approach to the prediction of the drug-target
   associations.


This project will be carried out mainly within the Capsid team at INRIA
Nancy which combines expertise in knowledge graphs, distributed graph
computing [6] and drug-target interactions (https://capsid.loria.fr).
Achieving the objectives of the thesis will involve acquiring knowledge and
understanding of the current state of the art in link prediction in large
and complex graphs. An important aspect of this project will be to explore
the use of big graph processing frameworks in order to design scalable
implementations of proposed link prediction methods in knowledge graphs.
The proposed techniques will be implemented on a local cluster and
evaluated using publicly available data.
This project will develop novel and practical link prediction algorithms
that will be applied to predict drug targets. This will help to satisfy an
important and current research need in drug repositioning. The developed
software will be made publicly available.

*Thesis tasks: *

   - Study existing link prediction algorithms in homogeneous graphs
   - Extend the approach to knowledge graphs (by considering node and edge
   properties)
   - Evaluate on well-known public RDF datasets
   - Apply to biological knowledge graphs describing drug-target
   interactions


*Required qualification: *
Candidates must have a master degree in computer science, mathematics, or
one of the physical sciences. Good programming skills in an object-oriented
programming language such as JAVA or C++ are essential. Experience of NoSQL
solutions (Neo4j, Titan, MongoDB), parallel/distributed programming (Spark,
Hadoop, Flink) and graph processing frameworks (Pregel, GraphLab, GraphX)
is also desirable but not essential. A strong interest in structural
biology would also be highly desirable.

*Advantages: *
- Duration: 3 years
- Starting date: between Oct. 1st 2019 and Jan. 1st 2020- Salary : 1 982
euros gross monthly (about 1 593 euros net) during the first and the second
years. 2 085 euros the last year (about 1 676 euros net). Medical insurance
is included.

*Help and benefits:*
Possibility of free French courses
Help for accommodations
Help for the resident card procedure and for husband/wife visa
Lunch cost at Inria canteen is about 3 =E2=82=AC
