Multimedia Tools and Applications Journal
Special Issue on Multimedia Data Annotation and Retrieval using Web 2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

Introduction
-------------

Currently, more than 80% of the information exchanged on the Web carry pers=
onal data and are primarily of multimedia nature (video, audio, images, etc=
.). Two main reasons are behind this phenomenon: 1) each of the major playe=
rs on the Internet (individual users, companies, local and/or regional auth=
orities, etc.) is both data producer and data consumer at the same time, an=
d 2) the use of various tools of Web 2.0 (blogs, social networks, etc.) all=
ows to ease sharing, accessing, and publishing information on the Web. Whil=
e such tools provide users many easy-to-use functionalities, several issues=
, however, remain unaddressed. For instance, how to automate the processes =
of annotation and description of some photos using the annotations/descript=
ions provided by the user friends on his/her blog/wiki/social network? How =
to provide the user with more effective and expressive means to multimedia =
information retrieval? How to protect a multimedia data repository (e.g., p=
hoto album) while several related information about the same content is alr=
eady published (by some user friends) on the same or other blog/wiki/social=
 network?
The general aim of this special issue is to assess the current approaches a=
nd technologies, as well as to outline the major challenges and future pers=
pectives, related to the use of Web 2.0 in providing automatic annotation a=
nd easing retrieval and access control of multimedia data. It aims to provi=
de an overview of the state of the art and future directions in this field,=
 by including a wide range of interdisciplinary contributions from various =
research groups.
