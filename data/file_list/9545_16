CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

First Spring School on Belief Functions Theory and Applications

Autrans, France, April 4-8, 2011

http://www.gipsa-lab.inpg.fr/summerschool/bfta

*DEADLINE FOR REGISTER: MARCH 15, 2011*

==================================================
The Belief Function Theory represents a new approach devised to model 
and manage imprecise information in Artificial and Computational 
Intelligence. The theory of belief functions also referred to as 
evidence theory or Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by 
Arthur P. Dempster in the context of statistical inference, and was 
later developed by Glenn Shafer as a general framework for modeling 
epistemic uncertainty. These early contributions have been the starting 
points of many important developments, including the Transferable Belief 
Model and the Theory of Hints. The theory of belief functions is now 
well established as a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, 
and has well understood connections to other frameworks such as 
probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. The field 
of application of this theory is very large.

The aimof this first spring school is to promote this theory and to 
introduce interested students and researchers to the basics of Belief 
Functions, both theoretical and applied. The school is organized into 
several lectures given by international experts. They will bring both 
theoretical and practical backgrounds, in a friendly environment 
favoring interaction between participants. An important part of the time 
will be devoted to the resolution of proposed exercises concerning 
applied problems. One objective of the school is to enable non 
specialists as well as potential users to become acquainted with the 
principles and fundamentals of the theory.*
