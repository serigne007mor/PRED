Signal Processing: Image Communication journal, Special Issue on =
Computational Image Editing


Call for Papers: Computational Image Editing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past decade, smartphones and social media applications have =
revolutionized our relationship to images. =46rom Instagram to Facebook, =
photographs are now ubiquitous and users demands have moved from simple =
image storage, posting and tagging to more advanced image editing. Image =
editing can also be referred to image manipulation and encompasses the =
processes of altering images to modify their visual content or quality. =
There are a lot of possible ways to visually modify images with =
computational techniques, e.g., noise reduction, removal of unwanted =
objects, sharpening, compositing, matting, to quote a few.

Some of these computational image editing techniques are now in the =
hands of consumers with applications such as Instagram or Snapseed. But =
while smartphones are a very visible driver of this advent of =
computational image editing techniques, this has been possible only with =
the huge developments of the techniques that have supported this =
revolution, from the display of high dynamic range images to the wide =
range of filters provided by Instagram.

Even with these recent advances, computational image editing is still =
one of the toughest problems of the imaging industry. Hence, =
professional photography editing is a long and laborious process that is =
highly dependent of the professional photographer skills that can spends =
hours to produce subjective and qualitative enhancements. It is easy to =
understand that if it normally takes many hours to perform a =
professional editing of a picture, doing it faster and automatically at =
a larger scale is difficult and challenging. On the other hand, recent =
advances have put to the forefront deep learning  based computational =
image editing for artistic style transfer, automatic colorization, and =
inpainting with very impressive results. With the help of hardware =
acceleration, these computationally intensive applications begin to be =
feasible on mobile devices.

Topics
------

The aim of the proposed special issue is to present some of the =
cutting-edge works currently being done on computational image editing =
and to reveal the challenges that still lie ahead.=20

We are soliciting original contributions that address a wide range of =
theoretical and practical issues including, but not limited to:
- Tone-Mapping
- Color constancy
- Color correction
- Edge-aware filtering
- Inpainting
- Matting
- Dehazing
- Compositing
- Seam carving
- Colorization
- Ink painting
- Style/color transfer
