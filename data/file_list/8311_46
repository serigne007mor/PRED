************************************************************************

Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne, Univeristé Jean-Monnet and Bell Labs 
co-organize the second edition of the
International Workshop on Semantic and Dynamic Analysis of Information 
Networks, co-located with Asonam 2013.

1. Background and Objectives

The objective of this workshop is to gather researchers and 
practitioners working
on the latest challenges concerning the semantic and dynamic analysis of 
information
networks.
The semantics and dynamics of information networks still need further 
exploration for
various needs multimedia content understanding & exploration, community 
discovery
for informal learning, etc.
Semantics of social interactions offers an unprecedented mean to capture 
knowledge on
social objects. For example we saw more and more socialized multimedia 
content that do
not benefits from the wisdom of crowds for their fine grained 
description. Picture and
videos are now common triggers for discussions but recent related works 
address only
the analysis of social interactions at a macro level, that do not reveal 
the potential
for in-media indexation and multiple perspectives descriptions. What 
will be the next step,
how to offer people discussions as an underlying structure of multimedia 
content?
Another important characteristic of these networks is that they evolve 
very quickly
and in real-time. Thus, it is very difficult to draw a clear image 
linking the existing
models of social networks (a graph) and the real underlying social 
phenomenon. How to
interpret the evolution of networks for social objects, how to predict 
the evolution of
such networks, how to link people not only from their individual 
profiles but from their
interest and opinion on common social objects.

Our workshop aims to be a discussion forum of new methods of dynamic and 
semantic analysis
in such networks, such as clustering in the network in order to extract 
meaningful user
communities (e.g. communities of users sharing common interests or being 
strongly connected),
link prediction in the network and outside the network, prediction of 
the evolution of the
network (e.g. content evolution, such as hot topics evolution), 
information diffusion,
influence evolution), knowledge discovery from social interaction 
analysis for socialized
multimedia content.

The workshop targets two types of contributions from prospective 
authors: contributions
dealing of theoretical tools and methods to solve practical problems as 
well as applications
solved by tools from network sciences. Both contributions should 
stimulate interaction between
theoreticians and practitioners.

Position papers or short, work-in-progress papers from PhD students and 
demos are both welcome.

2. Keynote Speaker

We are happy to confirm Noshir Contractor as keynote speaker.

Noshir Contractor is the Jane S. & William J. White Professor of 
Behavioral Sciences in the
McCormick School of Engineering & Applied Science, the School of 
Communication and the Kellogg
School of Management at Northwestern University, USA.
He is the Director of the Science of Networks in Communities (SONIC) 
Research Group at Northwestern
University. Professor Noshir Contractor is investigating factors that 
lead to the formation,
maintenance, and dissolution of dynamically linked social and knowledge 
networks in communities.
Specifically, his research team is developing and testing theories and 
methods of network science to map,
  understand and enable more effective networks in a wide variety of 
contexts including communities of practice
  in business, science and engineering communities, disaster response 
teams, public health networks,
digital media and learning networks, and in virtual worlds, such as 
Second Life.

3. Topics include, but are not limited to:

. Data preparation/pre-processing for mining large social networks
. Community discovery in social networks, drift/evolution in web communities
. Mining stream data in evolving social networks, real-time mining
. Discovering influential members/implicit relationships
. Structural network properties and analysis
. Structure evolution in information networks
. Motif discovery in complex networks
. Recommendation strategies in evolving information networks
. New challenges in mining information networks
. Example studies and use cases that leverage the content shared in 
social networks
. Information propagation or diffusion in information networks
. Content evolution in information networks
. Social multimedia mining and learning from social interactions; 
multimedia communication and networking
   by utilizing multimedia social network analysis;

4. Important Dates:

. Full papers submission deadline: April 15, 201
. Notification of acceptance: May 6, 2013
. Camera ready papers: May 31, 2013
. Author registration due: June 10, 2013
. Workshop date:  Niagara Falls, Canada, August 25-28, 2013

5. Publication of Papers

Expected Submissions:

- Full Paper: A regular paper presents a work where the research is
  completed or almost finished.  Authors of regular submitted papers
  will indicate at the time of submission whether they would like
  their paper to also be considered for publication as a position
  paper.
- Position Paper: A position paper presents results that are
  preliminary or that simply require few pages to describe. A position
  paper may be a short report and discussion of ideas, facts,
  situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research
  (bibliographic, experimental, theoretical, or other) focused on one
  of the conference topics. The acceptance of a position paper is
  restricted to the categories of "short paper" or "poster".

. Regular workshop papers will be published in the conference proceedings.
. We are happy to announce that extended version of selected accepted 
papers will be invited for publication
  in a special issue of IJSNM, the International Journal on Social 
Network Mining published by Inderscience and
  indexed in DBLP Computer Science Bibliography and Google Scholar.
