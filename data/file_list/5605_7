The 1st Foundations & Practice of Security (FPS) Symposium was held in =
2008, following
the Canada-France Meeting on Security held at the Simon Fraser Universi=
ty, Vancouver,
on December 06-08, 2007.

Since then, the FPS Symposium has been held annually, alternating Canad=
ian and French
locations. After the previous meetings took place in Grenoble, Toronto,=
 Paris, Montr=C3=A9al,
La Rochelle, Montr=C3=A9al, Clermont-Ferrand, Quebec City, Nancy, Montr=
=C3=A9al, Toulouse,
Montr=C3=A9al and Paris, this 15th edition of the FPS symposium will be=
 held in Ottawa,
Canada.

Protecting the communication and data infrastructure of an increasingly=
 inter-connected
world has become vital to the normal functioning of all aspects of our =
world. Security has
emerged as an important scientific discipline whose many multifaceted c=
omplexities
deserve the attention and synergy of the mathematical, computer science=
, and
engineering communities.

The aim of FPS is to discuss and exchange theoretical and practical ide=
as that address
privacy and security issues in inter-connected systems. It aims to prov=
ide scientific
presentations as well as to establish links, promote scientific collabo=
rations, joint
research programs, and student exchanges between institutions involved =
in this
important and fast-moving research field.

We welcome submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and appli=
ed work
including user research, methods, tools, simulations, demos, and practi=
cal evaluations.
Submissions should be 16 pages for full technical papers and 8 pages fo=
r short,
position papers or demos including references. We also invite papers fr=
om researchers
and practitioners working in security, privacy, trustworthy data system=
s, and related
areas to submit their original papers. Moreover we are interested in da=
ta sharing, data
disclosure, individual tracking, and fake news regarding their impacts =
on security and
privacy.

ed):
