History

The RIAO conference is a triennial conference, addressing research topics
related to
the design of robust and large-scale scientific and industrial solutions to
information processing. Previous RIAO editions were held at Grenoble
(1985), MIT
(1988), Barcelona(1991), Rockefeller University (1994), Montreal (1997),
Paris
(2000), Avignon (2004), and Carnegie Mellon University(2007). RIAO
conferences
provide peer-reviewed scientific sessions and demonstrations of innovative
industrial applications and advanced research prototypes.

Paper Submission

We welcome submissions from both research and industrial communities
addressing the
main conference theme.
Submitted papers must describe unpublished original work, emphasizing
completed or
advanced research.
A parallel submission to other venues should be clearly indicated to the
program
committee.
Submissions must be blind, any submission containing the authors names
will be
rejected.
Submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.
The submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, relevance,
technical
quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories: full
papers
and short papers.
Full papers are appropriate for describing substantial research with relevant
evaluation.
Short papers may describe ongoing research and preliminary results.
All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference
proceedings.
At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and short
papers will be
presented as a poster.
Long papers must not exceed 12 pages (5000 words), in one column format,
including
the abstract.
Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (2500 words), in one column,
including the
abstract.
See http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates for the
accepted
paper format.

The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees, and
through
the CID after the conference.
The submission site for scientific papers is the following:

Call for Applications

Program Chair:
* Josiane Mothe (France)
* Philippe Roy (France)

The RIAO conferences are meeting places for scientific and industrial
specialists in
information retrieval. There are sites for presentations of both high-level
peer-reviewed scientific research and prototypes and of innovative products,
selected by a special Call for Applications. This present Call for
Application has
been sent at the same time that the Call for Papers for the RIAO 2010
Conference.
The products presented are chosen uniquely on the basis of their
innovativeness in
the area of the conference topics.
The "Centre de Hautes Etudes Internationales d'Informatique Documentaire"
(C.I.D.)
organizes the RIAO conferences every three years since 1985. RIAO stands for
"Recherche d'Information Assistee par Ordinateur", i.e. computer aided
Information
search.
RIAO conferences have two selection committees: a Program Committee for
scientific
papers, and an Applications Committee which seeks out and selects those
innovative
products for the conference.
The RIAO conferences are not trade shows since the teams presenting
innovative
applications are selected and do not pay for the booth and time that they
are given
during the conference.
Companies whose application fulfills the criteria of novelty and of
innovativeness
can fill in an electronic form designed by the conference organizers that
describes
their submitted application.
In addition to the form, application submitters will have to provide
access to an
online or CD version of the demo or released product that demonstrates the
claimed
innovative functionalities of the application. Applications Committee
members will
verify the functionalities of the product.
After examination of the dossier and the demonstration of each
application, the
Application Committee members select the best products.
Each chosen company will be provided with a demonstration space (including
table and
chair) free of charge. The space is near the amphitheatre in which the
scientific
papers are presented.
Each company may also be given a special time slot (15 minutes) to give a
short
presentation of the product.
A dedicated social event sponsored by Cap Digital, digital content cluster
of the
Paris Region, will allow selected companies to meet with French top
innovative SMEs
in the domain of knowledge engineering and multimedia services.
The general topic of the Call for Applications is:
ADAPTIVITY, PERSONALIZATION AND FUSION OF HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION
Detailed topics are listed above in the call for papers.
Descriptions of the products demonstrated during RIAO 2010 will be
published in the
proceedings.
