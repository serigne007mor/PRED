CALL FOR PAPERS
***************

With the increasing success of cloud computing,=20
cloud business intelligence "as a service"=20
offerings have sparkled widely, both from cloud=20
start-ups and major BI industry vendors. Beyond=20
porting BI features into the cloud, which already=20
implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL=20
database modeling and storage, data localization,=20
security and privacy, performance, cost and usage=20
models...), this trend also poses new, broader=20
challenges for making data analytics available to=20
small and middle-size enterprises (SMEs),=20
non-governmental organizations, web communities=20
(e.g., supported by social networks), and even=20
the average citizen; this vision presumably=20
requiring a mixture of both private and open data.

The aim of the Cloud-I workshop is to become an=20
