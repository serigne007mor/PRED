Subject: [liste-egc] Call for Papers - ECML PKDD 2022 journal track

<html><head></head><body><div style=3D"font-family: Verdana;font-size: 12=
=2E0px;"><div>
<div>We invite submissions for the journal track of the European Conferenc=
e on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in=
 Databases (ECMLPKDD) 2022=2E The journal track of the conference is implem=
ented in partnership with the Machine Learning Journal and the Data Mining =
and Knowledge Discovery Journal=2E The conference provides an international=
 forum for the discussion of the latest high-quality research results in al=
l areas related to machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery=
=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>*Eligibility Criteria*</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Papers on all topics related to machine learning, knowledge discovery=
, and data mining are invited=2E However, given the special nature of the j=
ournal track, only papers that satisfy the quality criteria of journal pape=
rs and at the same time lend themselves to conference talks will be conside=
red=2E Consequently, journal versions of previously published conference pa=
pers, or survey papers will *not* be considered for the special issue=2E No=
te that a paper rejected by the Machine Learning Journal should not be subm=
itted to the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal and vice versa=2E =
Papers that do not fall into the eligible category, or that are found to no=
t satisfy minimum quality criteria during editorial review, may be rejected=
 without formal reviews but can of course be resubmitted as regular confere=
nce track papers=2E&nbsp;<br/>
Authors are encouraged to adhere to the best practices of Reproducible Res=
earch (RR), by making available data and software tools for reproducing the=
 results reported in their papers=2E For the sake of persistence and proper=
 authorship attribution, we require the use of standard repository hosting =
services such as dataverse, mldata, openml, etc=2E for data sets, and mloss=
, bitbucket, github, etc=2E for source code=2E Authors who submit their wor=
k to the ECMLPKDD special issues of these journals commit themselves to pre=
senting their paper at the ECMLPKDD conference if it is accepted=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>*Reviewing*</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The journal track allows continuous submissions from October 2021 to =
February 2022=2E Papers will be processed and sent out for review after eac=
h of the following three cutoff dates:</div>

<div>- October 8, 2021<br/>
- December 10, 2021<br/>
- February 11, 2022</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The deadline on each of these dates is 23:59, Central European Time=
=2E We strive for a high quality and efficient review process=2E For each s=
ubmission, we aim at obtaining at least two reviews from experienced review=
ers, including members of the Guest Editorial Board=2E Our goal is to arriv=
e at an initial decision about 10 weeks after each cutoff date, though meet=
ing this target may not always be possible=2E After the initial review phas=
e, many papers will require substantial revisions, and the revised paper wi=
ll be re-reviewed, which extends the review process=2E Consequently, a pape=
r&rsquo;s chance of finishing the review cycle and being included in the EC=
MLPKDD 2022 special issue decreases with each subsequent cutoff date=2E Thi=
s means that accepted papers, especially those that were submitted to the l=
ater deadlines, may be included in the ECMLPKDD 2023 (or even later) specia=
l issue (and subject to approval of the ECMLPKDD steering committee and fut=
ure organizers)=2E The reviewing process is single-blind=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>*Submission Procedure*&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>To submit to this track, authors have to make a journal submission to=
 either the Springer Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal (https://w=
ww=2Eeditorialmanager=2Ecom/dami/default=2Easpx) or the Springer Machine Le=
arning journal (https://www=2Eeditorialmanager=2Ecom/mach/default=2Easpx), =
and select the type of submission to be for the ECMLPKDD 2022 special issue=
=2E&nbsp;<br/>
It is recommended that submitted papers do not exceed 20 pages including r=
eferences=2E Every paper may be accompanied with unlimited appendices=2E Th=
e papers should be formatted in the Springer journal style (svjour3, smallc=
ondensed)=2E Templates can be found at https://www=2Espringernature=2Ecom/g=
p/authors/campaigns/latex-author-support</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Both journals require authors to include an information sheet (for Ma=
chine learning submissions) or a cover letter (up to 2 pages) as a suppleme=
ntary material (for Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery submissions) that c=
ontains a short summary of their contribution and specifically address the =
following questions:</div>

<div>- What is the main claim of the paper? Why is this an important contr=
ibution to the machine learning/data mining literature?<br/>
- What is the evidence provided to support claims? Be precise=2E<br/>
- Report 3-5 most closely related contributions in the past 7 years (autho=
red by researchers outside the authors&rsquo; research group) and briefly s=
tate the relation of the submission to them=2E<br/>
- Who are the most appropriate reviewers for the paper? Authors are requir=
ed to suggest up to four candidate reviewers (especially if external to the=
 Guest Editorial Board), including a brief motivation for each suggestion=
=2E<br/>
- Optionally, list up to four researchers/potential reviewers with competi=
ng interests that should not be considered for reviewers=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

dd2022@framalistes=2Eorg</div>
