*Postdoc position in Artificial Intelligence-based Drug Design*

     Available Montpellier (october 2021), France, 18 months

*Keywords*
     Drug design, Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence

*Overview and challenges*
     The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolution in 
many areas.
     Its application in the design of new pharmaceutical products is 
still in its infancy but is in full development.
     The main application of AI in the medical field has primarily been 
used in the processing of metadata generated during the clinical 
development of drug candidates. Biomolecule design assistance is more 
recent and there are several types of approaches.
     The most common is: identifying favorable parameters in a list of 
active compounds and then trying to find them by screening commercial 
databases.
     In this approach, new structures are not generated, only a 
repositioning strategy is used. The second more ambitious approach is to 
go through the generation of new structures.
     To date, the number of examples in the literature is very limited. 
This strategy is based on the analysis of active compounds in the 
literature to extract the structural data necessary for the activity to 
allow the generation of new molecules.
     The main pitfall of this approach is to take into account the 
biological activities which can be very variable according to the 
experimental conditions and which can lead to introducing erroneous data 
into the system.
     In addition, the rare examples of this approach are not all 
validated by a biological model or lead to the generation of chemically 
questionable structures.
     This multidisciplinary project aims to provide an alternative 
approach to the design of biomolecules for therapeutic purposes through 
the assistance of a method based on artificial intelligence approaches 
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Autoencoders.

*Expected profile*
     We are looking for a Postdoc of 18 months with experience in 
machine and deep learning. The candidate will demonstrate aptitudes or 
matches with most of the following aspects:
         - A PhD in Computer Science
         - An established research record
         - High motivation for scientific research
         - Strong background in deep learning
         - Strong programming skills (e.g. Python, PyTorch) and prior 
development experience with real-world and benchmark data
         - Good communication skills in English (both oral and written)
         - Chemical knowledge will be appreciated

*Application*
     Applications for this position will be received EXCLUSIVELY in a 
single PDF document containing your name in its title accessible for 
download via email sent to the three supervisors. Please avoid attached 
documents and include links if you would like to send an additional 
document. The subject of the email must be “Application for Post doc 
position in Artificial Intelligence-based Drug Design”.

*Required documents are:*
     - A curriculum vitae
     - A motivation letter describing your interest in the position and 
the matches with the expected profile
     - A link to your phd thesis and relevant related publications
     - Names and contact details of referees and / or letters of 
recommendation
     - Other useful information

*Contract *
     The successful candidate will be employed by the University of 
Montpellier for a 18 months period of time (~ 2200€/month). Social 
security and benefits are included.

*Collaboration*
     - Institute of Biomolecules Max Mousseron
     - LIRMM - Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics and 
Microelectronics of Montpellier

*Contacts*
     - Pascal Poncelet, full professor at University Montpellier, 
pascal.poncelet@lirmm.fr
     - Jérôme Azé, full professor at University Montpellier, 
jerome.aze@lirmm.fr
     - Sandra Bringay, full professor at Paul Valéry University 
Montpellier, sandra.bringay@lirmm.fr
