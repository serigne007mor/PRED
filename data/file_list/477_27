eHealth 2009: 2nd International Conference on electronic healthcare

Patients or Users - who are we developing services for?

http://www.electronic-health.org/

23-25th September 2009 - Istanbul, Turkey

CONFERENCE AIMS

Building on a very successful eHealth 2008 conference, the aim of 
eHealth 2009 is to bring together experts from academia, industry and 
global healthcare institutions to stimulate cutting-

edge research discussions, share experience with real-world healthcare 
service providers and policy makers as well as provide numerous business 
opportunities.

Despite substantial budgets spent on eHealth in recent years, existing 
healthcare services do not sufficiently address the issue of patient 
privacy, trust, quality-assurance nor the potential in e-learning and 
web minding for delivering 21st century healthcare system for European 
citizens. The key topic of eHealth 2009 is investigating a realistic 
potential of the Internet in providing evidence-based medical advice and 
quality-assured education for patients to improve wellbeing of European 
and global citizens.

CONFERENCE TOPICS

1. Privacy, Trust and Security - electronic patient records, models for 
trust and privacy, novel mobile encryption technologies, identity 
federation, role based access control, privacy enhancing

technologies.

2. Epidemiology and Early Warning Systems and Outbreak Detection - 
information and IT support systems for early warning and outbreak 
detection programs, data management issues, data

collection and analysis for surveillance and epidemiology.

3. Healthcare Ontologies and Knowledge Management Systems - annotation, 
health care ontologies, coding standards, communication standards, 
quality tagging and quality of service,

distribution issues, coding systems and ontologies mapping, search, 
users customisation, alert agents.

4. E-learning, Educational Games and the Impact of Information Delivery 
to Patients and Professionals - using digital Libraries in building 
online communities, moderated discussion

groups, qualitative and quantitative evaluation studies, user attitude 
towards the knowledge, studies of changes of user attitude with respect 
to digital libraries.
