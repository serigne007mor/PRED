Subject: [liste-egc] postdoc: multimodal detection of fake news, IRISA
 Rennes


Title : Multimodal detection of Fake News
Keywords: NLP, multimodal embedding, image/video processing, social networks
Full desc: 
http://www.irisa.fr/offres-emploi/2021-05/multimodal-detection-fake-news
Duration: 18 months
Contact : vincent.claveau@irisa.fr  ewa.kijak@irisa.fr


Context
=======
The post-doc will be supervised by Ewa Kijak and Vincent Claveau, IRISA, 
Rennes, France.
The position is to be filled as soon as possible and will end at most in 
Dec. 2022 (max duration 18 months).

Research topics
===============
The objective of the project is to propose and implement robust 
approaches to detect manipulations in documents containing text and 
images, adapted in particular to social networks. To do so, we wish to 
exploit multimodal information and contextual information (knowledge 
base on personalities, publication context).
The research questions that arise are the following:
How to leverage users' reactions to detect fake news?
Which multimodal representations are most suitable to deal with 
text/image news?
How to take advantage of advances on multimodal tasks such as the 
generation of one modality from another to from another to extract new 
multimodal representations?
What database search strategies should be used? How should the returned 
results be exploited?
How can attention layers be used to highlight the words or regions of 
the image that contributed the most to the decision?
