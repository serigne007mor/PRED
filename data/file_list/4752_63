-------*Call for papers CAp ("Conférence sur l'Apprentissage 
automatique") 2020*

website: https://cap-rfiap2020.sciencesconf.org/


CAp is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection 
of machine learning, applied mathematics, and related areas.
In case you do not have time to read everything, here is a brief summary 
of the main changes of this year edition compared to the previous 
editions of the conference:

     1) CAp will be held jointly with *RFIAP* (Reconnaissance des 
Formes, Image, Apprentissage et Perception).
     2) CAp will take place from the *24th to the 26th of June 2020 in 
Vannes*
     3) The submission deadline for CAp is the *26 of March 2020* (one 
month ahead of the usual deadline)
     4) The conjoint event will host (5) inspiring invited speakers 
interesting for both communities:

  *          Prof. Dr. Christian Theobalt, Max Planck Institut Informatik
  *          Dr. Diane Larlus, Senior Researcher, NAVER LABS Europe
  *          Prof. Dr. Rachid Guerraoui, EPFL, annual chair of
    "Informatique et sciences numériques" within Collège de France in
    2018-2019
  *          Dr. Emilie Kauffman, CR CNRS
  *          Prof. Dr. Arthur Gretton, Gatsby Computational Neuroscience
    Unit, University College London


---------------
 From the 23rd to the 26th of June 2020, SSFAM (Société Savante 
Française d'Apprentissage Machine) and AFRIF (Association Française pour 
la Reconnaissance et l'Interprétation des Formes) will jointly organized 
*on the Tohannic campus of Université de Bretagne Sud in Vannes*, CAp 
(Conférence sur l'Apprentissage automatique) and RFIAP (Reconnaissance 
des Formes, Image, Apprentissage et Perception). The two communities 
have numerous common research problems and we believe that this 
co-location will allow for very fruitful discussions. RFIAP will be held 
from the 23rd to the 26th of June while CAp will be help from the 24th 
to the 26th of June 2020. The two conferences will have separate 
submission procedures but all submissions will be handled through 
EasyChair.

*Key dates:**
**    - *Joint Event: 23-26 June 2020
     - Cap papers submission deadline: 26 March 2020
     - Notification to authors for CAp papers: 11 May 2020
     - Early bird registration for the conference: 29th May 2020

The submission website is: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cap20200
Submitted papers can be either in English or in French and we encourage 
two types of submissions:
     - Full research papers on the theme of machine learning theory and 
its applications should not exceed *10 pages in CAp double-column 
format* (including references and figures). A suitable LaTeX template 
for CAp is available at 
https://cap-rfiap2020.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/cap2020_template.zip.
     - Short papers can be *up to four to 6 pages* using the same format 
as the full papers. They present original ideas and provide an 
opportunity to describe significant work in progress.

We also encourage the submission of *recent* (2019 or 2020) *papers 
accepted to high level conferences and journals in machine learning.* 
These papers will also be reviewed (lightly) by the program committee. 
If accepted, they will be presented at the conference but will not 
appear in any (online) proceedings. Note that, in this particular case, 
the paper can be submitted in the original conference format (length and 
style) and the reviews given by the conference/ML journal where it was 
accepted should be included as the first pages of the submission in 
addition to a link to the corresponding conference/ML journal web page. 
The submission of the reviews and the original paper should be merged 
and submitted into a single PDF file on the easychair website.

Some accepted papers will be presented in a long (20 minutes) oral 
presentation and all the accepted papers will be given the opportunity 
to be presented as a spotlight (3 minutes) and as a poster at the 
conference. These presentations are an opportunity to have constructing 
and rigorous feedbacks, as well as to establish contacts with members of 
the french machine learning community. PhD Students are particularly 
welcome and encouraged to submit papers. Contributions will be freely 
distributed on the conference website, subject to approval by the authors.

Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:
     Learning theory, models and paradigms:
         Active learning
         Online learning
         Multi-target, multi-task, multi-instance, multi-view and 
transfer learning
         Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
         Reinforcement learning
         Relational learning
         Representation learning
         Symbolic learning
         Bandit algorithms
         Matrix and tensor factorization
         Grammar induction
         Kernel methods
         Bayesian methods
         Spectral methods
         Stochastic processes
         Ensemble learning and boosting
         Graphical models
         Gaussian process
         Neural networks and deep learning
         Learning theory
         Game theory
     Optimization et related problems:
         Large-scale machine learning and optimization
         Optimization algorithms
         Distributed optimization
         Machine learning and structured data (spatio-temporal data, 
tree, graph)
         Classification with missing values
     Applications:
         Social network analysis
         Temporal data analysis
         Bioinformatic
         Data mining
         Neuroscience
         Natural language processing
         Information retrieval
         Computer vision
