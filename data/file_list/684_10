Call for Papers

9th International Conference on Discovery Science
October 7-10, 2006, Barcelona, Spain
http://www-ai.ijs.si/~ds06/

 
Call for Papers

The Ninth International Conference on Discovery Science (DS-06)
will be held in Barcelona, Spain, from 7-10 of October 2006.
DS-06 will be collocated with ALT-06, the Sixteenth International
Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory. The two conferences
will be held in parallel, and they will share their invited
talks. The proceedings of DS-06 will appear in the Lecture Notes
in Artificial Intelligence by Springer-Verlag.

DS-06 provides an open forum for intensive discussions and
interchange of new information among researchers working
in the area of Discovery Science. The scope of the conference
includes the analysis and development of methods for
intelligent data analysis, knowledge discovery and machine
learning, as well as their application to scientific knowledge
discovery.


Submissions
 
We invite submissions of research papers addressing all aspects
of discovery science. We particularly welcome contributions that
discuss the application of data analysis and other support
techniques for scientific discovery including, but not limited
to, biomedical, astronomical and other physics domains.
 
Two types of submissions are solicited: regular and long papers.
Regular papers will be presented in an oral spotlight presentation
and a poster; authors of long papers will have the opportunity to
give an extended oral presentation. The submission web site will
be available at http://www-ai.ijs.si/~ds06/
 
A paper submission must be formatted according to the layout
supplied by Springer-Verlag for the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series. Regular papers must not exceed five (5) pages,
whereas long papers may contain up to twelve (12) pages.
 
 
Mentoring Program and Student Award
 
DS-06 features a new mentoring program. Students who are first
authors of papers are invited to submit a paper draft on or before
the mentoring deadline. They will receive a comments from
a PC member that will help them to prepare the final submission.
 
Carl Smith Award will be given to an excellent student paper.
The award carries a scholarship prize of 555 Euros.
 
 
Submission Topics
 
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
 * Logic and philosophy of scientific discovery,
 * Knowledge discovery, machine learning and statistical methods,
 * Active knowledge discovery,
 * Text mining, named entity recognition, etc.
 * Information extraction from scientific literature,
 * Knowledge discovery from text and the web,
 * Knowledge discovery from unstructured and multimedia data,
 * Knowledge disvovery in network and link data,
 * Knowledge discovery in social networks,
 * Data and knowledge visualization,
 * Human-machine interaction for knowledge discovery and management,
 * Biomedical knowledge discovery, analysis of microarray and
 gene deletion data,
 * Applications of the above techniques to natural or social
 sciences.
