The 7th International Conference on Signal Image Technology and Internet Ba=
sed Systems (SITIS'11)
                                  November 28 - December 1, 2011
                                      Dijon, France
                                 http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/SITIS
                 In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP.fr, IFIP TC 2 WG 2.13, and =
IEEE (pending)

The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to r=
epresent, share and process information in various forms, ranging multimedi=
a data to traditional structured data and semi-structured data found in the=
 web. SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that increasingly play=
 a key role in connecting systems across network centric environments to al=
low distributed computing and information sharing.

SITIS 2011 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on resear=
ch activities centered on the following tracks:

* The focus of the track "Internet-Based Computing and Systems" (IBCS) focu=
ses on emerging and novel concepts, architectures and methodologies for inf=
ormation management. The Internet and the related technologies have created=
 an interconnected world in which information can be exchanged easily, task=
s can be processed collaboratively, communities of users with similarly int=
erests can be formed to achieve efficiency and improve performance. The mai=
n topics include (but not limited to) data semantics and ontologies, semi-s=
tructure data management, spatial information systems, multimedia databases=
, multimedia networking and QoS, information retrieval and search engine, i=
nformation security, schema mapping and evolution, data warehousing, social=
 network, interoperability, agent-based systems, distributed and parallel i=
nformation management, grid, P2P, web-centric systems, web security and int=
egrity issues.

* The second track titled "Signal & Image Technologies" (SIT) focuses on re=
cent developments in digital signal processing and pays particular attentio=
n to evolutions in audiovisual signal processing, analysis, coding and auth=
entication, and retrieval techniques. The main topics of interest include (=
but not limited to) image processing and analysis, segmentation, shape matc=
hing, signal processing, radar sonar, mobile signal processing, nonlinear a=
nd multidimensional signal processing, Image/Video coding and authenticatio=
n, coding standards, image and video over networks, error resilience, motio=
n detection and estimation, object tracking, multimedia processing, video s=
treaming, watermark embedding and detection, and applications


In addition to the above tracks, SITIS 2011 includes workshops. The final l=
ist of workshop will be provided later.

Submission and publication
--------------------------
The conference will include keynote addresses, tutorials, and regular and w=
orkshop sessions.
SITIS 2011 invites submission of high quality and original papers on the to=
pics of the major tracks described below.
All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for te=
chnical merit, originality, significance and relevance to track topics.

Papers must be up to 8 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication for=
mat.
Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and publishe=
d by IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major indexes.
