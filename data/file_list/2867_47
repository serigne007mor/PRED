BITBP: The 1st International Workshop on Blending Internet-of-Things 
with Business Processes.

http://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~sellam_m/IoTwBP

To be held in conjunction with The 31st International Conference on 
Advanced Information Systems Engineering (*CAiSE*) at Sapienza 
University di Roma, Rome, Italy, from 3 to 7 June, 2019.
https://www.caise19.it/

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
Paper Submission:  March 2, 2019
Decision Notification: March 16, 2019
Camera-Ready Submission: March 23, 2019


This workshop examines the blend of IoT with business processes (BPs) in 
terms of conceptual, technical, and legal issues that potentially 
undermine this blend, solutions that achieve this blend, and 
recommendations that sustain this blend. Compared to BPM, which is a 
well-established discipline, IoT remains relatively new and barely 
« touched »  as an R&D discipline. Indeed, today's things act as 
« silos » due to challenges related to diversity and multiplicity of 
things' development and communication technologies, users' reluctance 
and sometimes rejection because of privacy invasion caused by things, 
limited IoT-platform interoperability, lack of an IoT-oriented software 
engineering discipline that guide thing analysis, design, and 
development, and, finally, the passive nature of most things that 
primarily act as data suppliers (with some actuating capabilities). By 
analogy to BPs that primarily compose activities, things could be 
composed in a way that would address the « silo » concern.

Our objective is to bring the BPM community and the IoT community 
together to discuss the cross-fertilization of IoT and BPs. IoT is an 
inter-disciplinary domain that can benefit from other domains such as 
Business Process Management (BPM) and social computing to develop 
composite things, Artificial Intelligence to develop cognitive things, 
and Normative Systems to develop accountable things.

This workshop is expected to be presentation-oriented. It will be an 
open forum for the BPM and IoT communities wishing to examine the 
cross-fertilization of these two disciplines. It will discuss ongoing 
research, identify industry needs, share practical experiences, and 
elaborate future trends.

TOPICS†
------†
We target contributions from both academia and industrials on the 
following topics, but not limited to:
- Adaptive business process models for sustainable IoT ecosystems
- Adaptive business process models for interoperable IoT ecosystems
- Robust business process models for trustworthy IoT ecosystems
- XaaS for business process model-oriented IoT ecosystems
- Security and privacy of business process model-oriented IoT ecosystems
- Context-aware business process model-oriented IoT ecosystems
- Cloud/Edge computing for business process model-oriented IoT 
ecosystems deployment
- Blockchains for building business process model-oriented IoT ecosystems
- Guidelines and best practices for blending Internet-of-Things with 
Business Processes
- Case studies and real-life experiences of blended Internet-of-Things 
and Business Processes

PAPER SUBMISSION†
----------------†
Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to 
SpringerÇ LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages, including all 
text, figures, references and appendices.

Information about the Springer LNCS format can be found at:
