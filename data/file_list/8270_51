Summer School Emerging Technologies and Applications in Telemedicine - Slov=
ak Republic - 26-31 August=20
www.mhealth.sk

The 1st IEEE EMBS Summer School on Emerging Technologies and Applications i=
n Telemedicine will be held at Smolenice Castle, Slovak Republic, August 26=
.-31.8.2013. It is for the first time that IEEE Engineering in Medicine & B=
iology Society approved the summer school in domain of telemedicine service=
s and technologies with aim of establishing the tradition of such event to =
be held every two years. The event is co-organized by National Centre of Te=
lemedicine Services, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, and Ins=
titute of Measurement Science, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

The summer school will provide an excellent opportunity for learning, teach=
ing and brain-storming for master and PhD. students, post docs, faculty, en=
gineers from industry and clinicians on a "closed-loop" of telemedicine cov=
ering data acquisition, data interpretation and clinical decision support. =
It will be an exciting and stimulating week of networking and discussions w=
ith prominent experts in the field related to biomedical signal processing,=
 biomedical data treatment, neuroengineering, healthcare informatics, biome=
dical telemetry, e-p-m Health and telemedicine technologies. The focus will=
 be on tutorial presentations where distinguished faculty will provide deta=
iled insight into biomedical signal processing, telemedicine technology and=
 devices, telemedicine systems and communications, data interoperability, c=
omputer aided decision making and applications of telemedicine.

Round table with healthcare and ICT industry representatives will support t=
he interaction between education, research, clinical practice and industry.=
 We believe that such discussion can help our attendees to gain new insight=
s and perspectives on telemedicine resulting in better transfer of research=
 results into market products and services.

The summer school will be held at the castle situated in beautiful surround=
ings of the village Smolenice located in the west of Slovakia, about 60 km =
from the capital city Bratislava. First written documents about the existen=
ce of Smolenice date back to the 13th century. Castle was built in 15th cen=
tury and since then have been owned by aristocratic families. During Napole=
on wars the main building and tower was considerably damaged by fire. Resto=
ration began in 19th century and was finished during 50's of the last centu=
ry. Since then it is owned by Slovak Academy of Sciences as its representat=
ive congress centre.

We hope that the 1st IEEE EMBS Summer School on Emerging Technologies and A=
pplications in Telemedicine: Addressing the Challenges of Chronic Disease M=
anagement will provide inspiring lectures, seminars and discussions in a ra=
pidly evolving field and foster motivation and participation of our attende=
es and colleagues in the adventure of research.
