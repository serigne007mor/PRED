============================================================================ 

The IJCAI-11 Workshop on
GRAPH STRUCTURES FOR KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING (GKR 2011)

http://www.lirmm.fr/~croitoru/GKR/index.html


July 16th 2011
Barcelona, Spain
============================================================================ 


*** Deadline: 4th April 2011 ***

============================================================================ 


Graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning is a growing area of 
research, with more and more important contributions appearing over the 
last few years.

Such KRR systems include Bayesian Networks (BNs), Semantic Networks 
(SNs), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), CP-nets, 
GAI-nets, Euler Diagrams, Existential Graphs all of which have been 
successfully used in a number of applications (Semantic Web, Reccomender 
Systems, BioInformtics etc.). The goal of this workshop is to bring 
together the researchers involved in the development and application of 
graph-based knowledge representation formalisms and reasoning techniques.

This workshop will investigate further developments of knowledge 
representation and reasoning graph based techniques. The workshop is 
expected to bring together people from different research communities 
that are actively pursuing this line of research. We hope that the 
presentation of different perspectives on employing graphs for 
representation and reasoning will be mutually enriching and will 
stimulate further research.

The papers will be judged from two perspectives: technical and application:

   * Technical results will include graph theory based results for novel 
structures for representation, extensions of existing structures for 
added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms for reasoning, 
reasoning explanation mechanisms etc.

   * Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to 
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed solutions.
