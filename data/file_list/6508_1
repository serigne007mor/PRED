Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponent=
ial use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environ=
ments namely "digital ecosystems"
connected to the web and composed of multiple and independent entities such=
 as individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing=
 one or several missions
and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them. With t=
he help of the computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exh=
ibit new self-* properties
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments=
, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", i=
n which resources provided
by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used.
The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, i=
nnovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms.

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly=
 complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to=
 how managing resources
will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-cre=
ating.
The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the=
 understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to=
 create benefits and added-values,
impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be impro=
ved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as b=
ig data management,
web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artifi=
cial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the es=
tablishment
of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International ACM Conference on Management of computational and collect=
ive IntElligence in Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring to=
gether a diverse
community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in e=
xploring the manifold challenges and issues related to resource management =
of Digital Ecosystems
and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to t=
his end.

MEDES 2014 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results or n=
ovel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems.=20=20
At the same time, the conference calls  for short papers presenting interes=
ting and exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas
that are not quite ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.


Topics
-------
MEDES 2014 seeks contributions in the following areas:

1. Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
2. Green computing
3. Computational and Collective Intelligence
4. Services
5. Trust, Security & Privacy
6. Data & Knowledge Management
7. Internet of Things and Intelligent Web
8. Human-Computer Interaction
9. Networks and Protocols
10. Open Source


Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website.
The submitted paper should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Pap=
ers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the p=
reliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all r=
eviewer inquiries and their comments.
Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with the final dec=
ision.
Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originali=
ty, technical soundness, and quality of presentation.
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging pos=
itions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems.
At least one author should attend the conference to present the paper.

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP.
