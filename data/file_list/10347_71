RCIS 2013 is a conference of RCIS Conference Series and is sponsored by
IEEE French section.


SCOPE AND TOPICS
The Seventh International Conference on RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION
SCIENCE (RCIS 2013) aims at providing an international forum for
scientists, researchers, engineers and developers from a wide range of
information science areas to exchange ideas and approaches in this evolving
field. While presenting research findings and state-of-art solutions, you
are especially invited to share experiences on new research challenges in
these main topics:

- Information System Engineering
- Requirements Engineering
 - Database and Information System Integration
- Data Management
- Information Search and Discovery
 - Software Testing
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Web Information Systems
 - Grid Computing and Cloud Computing
- Social Computing
- User Centred Approaches
 - Decision Information Systems
- Knowledge Management
- Knowledge Discovery from Data
 - Business Process Analysis, Modelling and Design
- Business Applications
 - Information Security Risk
- Information and Value Management

Tutorials may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although
authors should not feel limited by them. Target tutorials are tutorials
with clear applicability to industry. Therefore, we encourage industry to
send proposals to prepare a tutorial on a very innovative and practical
subject.

This year, RCIS is being held in conjunction with the 31st French
Conference on Information Systems (INFORSID 2013), a prominent French
scientific event sharing with RCIS the interest on the field of Information
Science. Any attendee of one conference will be entitled to attend the
tutorials of the other.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS
Tutorial proposals must be no more than 5 pages. The tutorial must be
scheduled for 1h30 and must clearly include:

 1. A short bio of the presenter;
2. A title;
3. A short abstract;
 4. Scope;
5. Background of the attendees;
6. Which material will be provided to attendees;
 7. Timetable.

Tutorial submission: February 15th, 2013
Tutorial notification: March 18th, 2013

To submit the proposal, you can send it by email to:
- Renata Guizzardi (Federal University of Esp=EDrito Santo, Brazil:
rguizzardi@inf.ufes.br)
 - Corine Cauvet (Aix-Marseille University, France, corine.cauvet@lsis.org)

All authors of accepted tutorials will be asked to sign a contract and will
also receive further instructions about how to prepare and submit the
tutorial notes, the tutorial summary (for the website) and speaker
biographies.

Tutorial speakers will receive a fix honorarium of 350 Euros per tutorial
(i.e., multiple speakers must share the honorarium). Additionally, free
registration for the conference will be offered to the main presenter (one
speaker).

There is no special registration fee to attend the tutorials. They will be
held in parallel to the sessions of the main conference.
