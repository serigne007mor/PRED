=============================================
ICCS'08 – International Conference on Conceptual Structures
Conceptual Structures: Knowledge Visualization and Reasoning
7-11 July, Toulouse, France

Call for Participation
=============================================

Information and registration: http://www.iccs.info


PURPOSE
=======
The 16th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS 2008)
is the latest in a series of annual conferences on Conceptual Structures
that have been held in Europe, Australia, and North America since 1993.
The focus of the conference has been the representation and analysis of
conceptual knowledge for research and practical application. ICCS brings
together researchers in information and computer sciences as well as
social science to explore novel ways that conceptual structures can be
deployed.

Conceptual Structures are motivated by C.S. Peirce's Existential Graphs
and over the years ICCS has broadened scope to include innovations from
a wider range of theories and related practices, among them Formal
Concept Analysis, Existential Graphs, Description Logics, Ontologies,
Concept Mapping and more. Accordingly, ICCS represents a family of
approaches related to conceptual structures that build on the successes
with techniques derived from artificial intelligence, knowledge
representation and reasoning, applied mathematics and lattice theory,
computational linguistics, conceptual modeling and design, visual
reasoning and logic, intelligent systems and knowledge management.

In 2008 ICCS's theme is Knowledge Visualization and Reasoning with an
emphasis to connect the theory and practice of conceptual structures to
its original visual forms of diagrammatic reasoning.


TOPICS
======
* conceptual structures  - theory and applications;
* the interplay of conceptual structures with language, semantics,
semiotics and pragmatics;
* conceptual data processing, analysis and conceptual logic;
* modeling, representation and visualizing conceptual structures;
* conceptual knowledge acquisition;
* knowledge representation with conceptual structures
* automated Reasoning and Conceptual Structures
* applied conceptual structures including data mining and knowledge
discovery
* the theory and applications of formal ontologies.
