Subject: [liste-egc] Conf. CIRCLE - Information Retrieval - call for
 participation - 7-9 July

Call for participation CIRCLE 2020 – 7-9 July 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------

CIRCLE 2020 is the first joint conference of the French, Italian, and 
Spanish information retrieval communities. The conference aims at 
stimulating and disseminating research in IR field among senior, 
industrial and early stage researchers (including MSc and PhD students).

CIRCLE 2020 program is now available at https://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE/program/

Unfortunately, the conference cannot be hosted in the planned holiday 
resort in Samatan, South of France, but have to be virtual. The IR 
communities had conceived the CIRCLE conference as a meeting and 
networking venue. The COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the conference 
did not make it possible.

The Conference will take place virtually, starting on the 7th of July 
and finishing on the 9th of July. Presentations are 15 mn long + 
questions and are live presentations by the papers’ authors.

These paper presentations are grouped into thematic sessions as follows: 
Frameworks and systems, Indexation and annotation, Information Retrieval 
evaluation, Information Retrieval in e-government, Query and ranking 
refinement, Recommender systems, Semantic extraction, Social media, 
Topic and document modelling, and User profiling and interaction.
Registration for attendees is free but we prefer you to register at 
https://www.irit.fr/CIRCLE/registration/ (the email you will provide 
will be used for inviting you in the conference room).

The conference will also be streamed on CIRCLE Youtube channel at 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KKMBMX99JG-WiBA3A7Bmg

Hope to see you!
