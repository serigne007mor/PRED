==========================================================

ECol Workshop @ CIKM’2015: Call for papers
*New deadline: June 19, 2015*

==========================================================

The 1st International Workshop on the

Evaluation of Collaborative Information Retrieval and Seeking ECol'2015
in conjunction with the 24th ACM International Conference on Information 
and Knowledge Management (CIKM)

Melbourne, Australia, October 23, 2015

http://www.irit.fr/ECol2015/
=========================================================

OVERVIEW

The paradigm of CIS/CIR refers to methodologies and technologies that 
support collective-knowledge sharing within a work team in order to 
solve a shared complex problem. One main challenge in CIS/CIR is to 
satisfy the mutual beneficial goals of both individual users and the 
collaborative group while maintaining a reasonable level of cognitive 
effort. In previous work, CIS/CIR evaluation relies on simulation-based 
protocols, user or log-based studies and metrics leveraging the 
individual vs. collaborative dimensions of search effectiveness. The 
most common evaluation strategy is to undertake both qualitative and 
quantitative evaluation according to the search tasks characteristics 
and evaluation objectives such as cognitive effort, usability, and 
individual vs. collective effectiveness. However, to date and to our 
knowledge, although substantial research advances in the evaluation of 
plenty information retrieval and seeking tasks have been achieved 
through international evaluation campaigns such as TREC, CLEF and NTCIR, 
no standardization effort has been achieved for the evaluation of 
CIS/CIR. We believe therein that there is an important need to 
investigate the evaluation challenge in CIS/CIR with the hope of 
building standardized evaluation frameworks that would foster the 
research area.

SCOPE AND TOPICS

Both theoretical and practical research papers are welcome from both 
research and industrial communities addressing the main conference 
topic,  but will also consider related aspects including models, 
methods, techniques and examples of CIS/CIR in theory and in practice. 
Original and unpublished papers are welcome on any aspect including:

  * CIS/CIR evaluation framework design and implementation
  * System-based vs. user-based evaluation approaches for CIS/CIR
  * Novel or extended traditional evaluation measures, test collections,
    methodologies of operational evaluation.
  * Models and methods of and for CIS/CIR
  * Impact of the collaborative session temporal synchronicity on the
    evaluation
  *   Evaluation of domain application-oriented CIS/CIR: exploratory
    search, travel planning, education project, legal and medical domain...
  * Evaluation of specific collaborative tasks (search, sensemaking,
    intent understanding…)
  * Studies on collective relevance judging
  * Studies of collaborative behavior applicable to evaluation
  * Simulation vs. log-studies vs. user-studies for collaborative search
  * Evaluation of single vs. collaborative search session
  * Connections to related research in contextual and interactive
    information seeking and retrieval
  * Evaluation Concerns and Issues: Reliability, Repeatability,
    Reproducibility, Replicability
  * Proposed evaluation tasks and collections for CIS/CIR
