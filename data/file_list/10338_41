**
*Call for Papers - DaWaK '13**
**15th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge 
Discovery (DaWaK 2013) **
**Prague, Czech Republic**
**August 26-29, 2013
http://dexa.org/dawak2013
***


Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery has been widely accepted as a 
key technology for enterprises and organizations to improve their 
abilities in data analysis, decision support, and the automatic 
extraction of knowledge from data. With the exponentially growing amount 
of information to be included in the decision making process, the data 
to be considered becomes more and more complex in both structure and 
semantics. New developments such as cloud computing and Big Data add to 
the challenges with massive scaling, a new computing infrastructure, and 
new types of data. Consequently, the process of retrieval and knowledge 
discovery from this huge amount of heterogeneous complex data builds the 
litmus-test for the research in the area.
Submissions presenting current research work on both theoretical and 
practical aspects of Big Data, Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery 
are encouraged. DaWaK 2013 is organized into 4 tracks as follows:

Big Data and Cloud Intelligence Track:

.    Big Data Storage
.    Big Data Query Languages and Optimization
.    Big Data Analytics and User Interfaces
.    Big Indexes
.    Massive data analytics: algorithms, techniques, and systems
.    Scalability and parallelization for cloud intelligence: map-reduce 
and beyond
.    Analytics for the cloud infrastructure
.    Analytics for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data
.    Semantic web intelligence
.    Analytics for temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal, and mobile data
.    Analytics for data streams and sensor data
.    Analytics for multimedia data
.    Analytics for social networks
.    Real-time/right-time and event-based analytics
.    Privacy and security in cloud intelligence
.    Reliability and fault tolerance in cloud intelligence

Data Warehousing Track:
.    Analytical front-end tools for DW and OLAP
.    Data warehouse architecture
.    Data extraction, cleansing, transforming and loading
.    Data warehouse design (conceptual, logical and physical)
.    Multidimensional modelling and queries
.    Data warehousing consistency and quality
.    Data warehouse maintenance and evolution
.    Performance optimization and tuning
.    Implementation/compression techniques
.    Data warehouse metadata

Knowledge Discovery:
.    Data mining techniques: clustering, classification, association 
rules, decision trees, etc.
.    Data and knowledge representation
.    Knowledge discovery framework and process, including pre- and 
post-processing
.    Integration of data warehousing, OLAP and data mining
.    Integrating constraints and knowledge in the KDD process
.    Exploring data analysis, inference of causes, prediction
.    Evaluating, consolidating, and explaining discovered knowledge
.    Statistical techniques for generation a robust, consistent data model
.    Interactive data exploration/visualization and discovery
.    Languages and interfaces for data mining
.    Mining Trends, Opportunities and Risks
.    Mining from low-quality information sources

Industry and Applications Track:
.    Big Data Analytics Applications
.    Data warehousing tools
.    OLAP and analytics tools
.    Data mining tools
.    Industry experiences
.    Data warehousing applications: corporate, scientific, government, 
healthcare, bioinformatics, etc.
.    Data mining applications: bioinformatics, E-commerce, Web, 
intrusion/fraud detection, finance, healthcare, marketing, 
telecommunications, etc
.    Data mining support for designing information systems
.    Business Process Intelligence (BPI)
