			CALL FOR PAPERS
		First international workshop on
	Methods and Design models for Health Information Systems
			(MeDeHIS’07)
		http://sigmacomp.imag.fr/MeDeHIS/index.html

In conjunction with the Second IEEE International Conference on Digital 
Information Management (ICDIM 2007) http://icdim.insa-lyon.fr/index.php
To be held October 28-31, 2007, Lyon, France

Health information systems are now centred around the patient and make a 
lot of health professionals communicate together for a particular health 
problem. These professionals have different jobs, knowledge, aim of 
work. Community health networks reveal virtual organizations which have 
particularly increased the need for collaboration between legacy 
information systems (hospitals, GPs, ancillary medical sector, etc). 
Within these networks, the business processes are increasingly complex 
and must be transverse with the various organizations of health. Their 
formalization and development require models, development processes and 
personalized, context-awareness and collaborative tools. The goal of 
this workshop is thus to federate research around the methods and design 
models of health information systems.

Topics
--------
A non-exhaustive list of topics for the workshop includes the following:
• Design of health business processes
• Personalization and context-awareness in models and approaches
• Reusability in health domain  models: business objects, design 
patterns, components, etc.
• Methods and collaborative tools for patient’s care
• Design of virtual health organization

Submission
------------
You are invited to submit full length papers, not exceeding 6 pages 
(3000-4000 words) in length, in two-column format including diagrams and 
references, following IEEE publication guidelines (see: 
http://icdim.insa-lyon.fr/camera_ready.php). Papers that do not follow 
these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.
Proceedings of the workshop will be published in an IEEE single volume 
and will be fully indexed by IEEE Xplore. All papers will be reviewed by 
at least two Program Committee members on the basis of technical 
quality, originality, clarity, and relevance to the track topics listed 
below.

At least one author of each paper must attend the workshop to present 
the paper.

A selection of the best papers will be published after extension in the 
following journals:
1. Journal of Digital Information Management (JDIM) (ISSN 0972-7272)
2. Journal of Information Assurance and Security (JIAS) (ISSN 1554-1010)
3. International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research (ISSN 
0973-1873)
4. International Journal for Infonomics (IJI) (ISSN 1742-4712)
5. International Journal of Internet Technology and Secured Transactions 
(IJITST) (ISSN 1748-569X)
