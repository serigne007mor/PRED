INVITED TALKS

Title: Meme Media and Knowledge Federation for Exploratory Visual Analytics=
 of Big Data
Invited Speaker: Prof. Yuzuru Tanaka, Computer Science Department, Graduate=
 School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University

Abstract:
Our meme media research started in 1989 has been focusing on extending the =
Web since 2008 to develop a WebTop meme media system WebbleWorld, with whic=
h people can publish, retrieve and utilize all kinds of Web resources inclu=
ding Web documents, Web applications and Web services, easily extract some =
portions of these resources as meme media objects, graphically and function=
ally combine these meme media objects to compose new Web resources as compo=
site meme media objects, and republish such composite Web resources into th=
e Web, only through direct manipulations. Such a process of extracting some=
 portions of Web resources, combining them to compose new Web resources is =
denoted by knowledge federation. Improvisational knowledge federation denot=
es that such federation can be performed improvisationally by end-users onl=
y through direct manipulation of Web resources. The WebTop meme media syste=
m WebbleWorld enables improvisational knowledge federation. During the last=
 several years!
, our team has been involved in two kinds of practical big data analysis pr=
ojects. One includes EU FP6 project ACGT (Advancing Clinico-Genomic Trials =
on Cancer) and its follow-up FP7 project p-medicine (personalized medicine)=
, where we deal with clinical trial data and patient genomic data. The othe=
r is a Japanese government-initiative project on social cyber-physical syst=
ems for the optimization on social system services, for example, snow plowi=
ng and removing services in Sapporo. These projects told us that the real w=
orlds of such practical applications cannot be formulated by monolithic mat=
hematical models. Macro analysis which simply applies the same statistical =
analysis or the same data mining algorithm to the whole target world may ea=
sily fail to obtain any significant result. Personalized medicine which is =
exactly based on this observation tries to find out a specific case of pati=
ents to whom some specific candidate treatment may show significantly bette=
r performance!
 than the other alternatives. In general, we may assume that r!
eal worlds may consist of a large number of sub worlds each of which can be=
 formulated by a rather simple monolithic mathematical model. Our question =
is how to find out those sub worlds, i.e., subsets of objects. There may be=
 two possible answers. One is to develop an advanced clustering algorithm t=
o automatically or semi-automatically find out those subsets. The other is =
the exploratory visual analytics approach. Unfortunately, there are no such=
 advanced clustering algorithms that may work for our current purpose. Ther=
efore, exploratory visual analytics is currently the only solution from pra=
ctical point of view in analyzing scientific big data in research studies a=
nd urban big data in strategic operation of urban infrastructures. Explorat=
ory visual analytics needs a large library of analysis tools and the capabi=
lity of improvisationally federating some of these tools together with diff=
erent data sources for complex analyses. This talk shows how meme media and=
 improvisatio!
nal knowledge federation technologies enable the development of highly inte=
ractive visual environments for exploratory visual analytics.

Title: Big Graph Data Processing
Invited Speaker: Prof. Wook-Shin Han, Dept. of Creative IT Engineering/Dept=
. of Computer Science and EngineeringUniversity of POSTECH, Korea

Abstract:
Graphs are used to model many real objects such as biological structures, s=
ocial networks, chemical compounds, ontologies, and web graphs. Real graphs=
 such as Facebook and Twitter have already reached a billion nodes, and we =
will soon be facing trillion-scale graphs. Many real applications in comput=
er science, bioinformatics, chemistry, physics, and health-care require eff=
icient and effective management of graph structured data. In this talk, I w=
ill first explain several key challenging issues related to big graph proce=
ssing and analytics. Next, I will introduce the iGraph framework for suppor=
ting subgraph indexing and subgraph search algorithms. Subgraph search has =
many important applications such as motif search in bioinformatics, and che=
mical compound search in chemistry, social network search, RDF query proces=
sing, and malware detection in computer science. Next, I will explain a nov=
el subgraph search algorithm called TurboISO, which significantly outperfor=
ms the state-o!
f-the-art method. Finally, I will introduce a ultrafast disk-based graph an=
alytics engine called TurboGraph, which shows ultrafast performance improve=
ment over state-of-the-art distributed engines.
