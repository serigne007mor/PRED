 Formal Ontology in Information Systems

FOIS 2023: 2nd Call for Papers
==============================

13th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems 
(FOIS 2023), July 17-20, 2023 (Sherbrooke, QC, Canada) and Sept 18-20, 
2023 (Online)

http://fois2023.griis.ca

We are happy to announce three exciting keynote speakers for FOIS 2023:
- Deborah McGuinness, Tetherless World Senior Constellation Chair and 
Professor of Computer and Cognitive Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, USA
- John Heil, Professor of Philosophy, Washington University, USA and 
Durham University, UK
- Michael Gruninger, Professor of Industrial Engineering, University of 
Toronto, Canada
More information about our keynotes speakers: 
https://fois2023.griis.ca/keynote-speakers/

Definition and scope
====================
The FOIS conference is a meeting point for all researchers with an 
interest in formal ontology. Formal ontology is the systematic study of 
the types of entities and relations making up the domains of interest 
represented in modern information systems. The conference encourages 
submission of high quality, not previously published results on both 
theoretical issues and practical advancements. FOIS 2023 will have 
distinct tracks for foundational issues, ontology applications and 
methods, and domain ontologies.

FOIS aims to be a nexus of interdisciplinary research and communication 
for researchers from many domains engaging with formal ontology. Common 
application areas include conceptual modeling, database design, 
knowledge engineering and management, software engineering, 
organizational modeling, artificial intelligence, robotics, 
computational linguistics, the life sciences, bioinformatics and 
scientific research in general, geographic information science, 
information retrieval, library and information science, as well as the 
Semantic Web.

FOIS is the flagship conference of the International Association for 
Ontology and its Applications (IAOA: http://iaoa.org/), which is a 
non-profit organization promoting interdisciplinary research and 
international collaboration in formal ontology.

Important dates
===============
- Paper submission deadline: 31 January 2023
- Author rebuttal period: March 24-31, 2023 (tentative)
- Notifications: April 10, 2023 (tentative)
- Camera-ready papers: May 1, 2023
- Onsite conference: July 17-20, 2023
- Virtual conference: September 18-20, 2023

The submission deadline for workshops will be after the notifications to 
allow authors to submit a revised version of rejected papers to any of 
the conference workshops if the paper topics are appropriate for this 
workshop.

Location
========
FOIS 2023 will consist of a physical meeting and a virtual meeting:

An in-person only meeting in Sherbrooke, Quebec from July 17 to 20, 2023 
that will be very much like a traditional conference with keynotes, 
regular talks, workshops and tutorials and plenty of social and 
networking opportunities. This part will not have a remote participation 
option, but we plan on recording selected talks (e.g. keynotes). The 
main conference will be from July 17 to 19 and workshops and tutorials 
will be held mostly on July 20.

This will be followed by an online part to be held from September 18 to 
20, 2023 that offers an opportunity for presentation and discussion of 
additional papers that were not presented at the physical meeting in 
Sherbrooke.

To plan for this two-part event, authors must at the time of submission 
indicate their preference and constraints for presenting either on site 
in Sherbrooke or virtually.  Acceptance will be either  for in-person 
presentation or for online presentation, at which time authors can no 
longer change the modality. Since the numbers of in-person and online 
presentations are limited, we encourage authors to be as flexible as 
possible to maximize your chance of paper acceptance.  More details are 
provided in the Submission Instructions.

Submissions
===========
FOIS 2023 seeks three types of full-length (14 pages) high-quality 
papers on a wide range of topics:
Foundational papers address content-related ontological issues, their 
formal representation, and their relevance to some aspect of information 
systems.

Application and Methods papers address novel systems, methods, and tools 
related to building, evaluating, or using ontologies, emphasizing the 
impact of ontology contents.

Domain ontology papers describe a novel ontology for a specific realm of 
interest, clarifying ontological choices against requirements and 
foundational theory, and showing ontology use.
Please refer to the submission instructions for more details. As usual, 
the FOIS proceedings will be published by IOS Press.

The conference will also offer workshops and tutorials related to formal 
ontologies. See the separate call for workshops and tutorials for more 
information.

Topics of interest
==================
Areas of particular interest to FOIS include the following:
- Foundational Issues
- Kinds of entities: particulars/universals, continuants/occurrents, 
abstracta/concreta, dependent entities/independent entities, natural 
objects/artifacts, events/processes
- Formal relations: parthood, identity, connection, dependence, 
constitution, causality, subsumption, instantiation
- Vagueness and granularity
- Space, time, and change
- Methodological issues
- Top-level vs. domain-specific ontologies
- Role of reference ontologies
- Ontology similarity, integration, alignment, matching and entity 
reconciliation
- Ontology modularity, patterns, and contextuality
- Ontology evaluation, quality, reuse, adaptation, and evolution
- Ontology compliance with FAIR principles
- Formal comparison among ontologies
- Relationship between conceptual modeling and ontologies
- Relationship with cognition, language, semantics, and context
- Connections between knowledge graphs and ontologies
- Methodological issues in the applications of ontologies
- Social issues, such as trust or bias, with respect to ontologies
- Applications
- Technical applications of ontologies, such as
- Semantic Web
- Other areas of AI (Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Rules)
- Qualitative modeling
- Systems applications of ontologies, such as
- Ontology-driven information systems design
- Ontology-based data access
- Knowledge management
- Information retrieval
- Computational linguistics
- Metadata management
- Domain applications of ontologies, such as
- Ontologies for business modeling
- Ontologies for particular scientific disciplines (biology, chemistry, 
geography, physics, geoscience, cognitive sciences, linguistics, etc.)
- Ontologies for engineering: shape, form and function, artifacts, 
manufacturing, design, architecture, etc.
- Ontologies for the humanities: arts, cultural studies, history, 
literature, philosophy, etc.
