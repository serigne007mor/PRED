Subject: [liste-egc] Workshop on Symbolic Data Analysis

Namur, Belgium, June 7th-9th

You are most welcome to attend the Workshop on Symbolic Data Analysis, to be
held in Namur, Belgium, next June 7th-9th.

Scientific organisers
Paula Brito, University of Porto (Portugal)
Monique Noirhomme-Fraiture, University of Namur (Belgium)

The Program, and all additional information are available at :
http://www.info.fundp.ac.be/SDA11/


About one and a half years after the last Workshop on Symbolic Data Analysis
(SDA), held in Wienerwaldhof, time has come to gather again people from
different teams working in this field, to review recent developments, from both
a theoretical and methodological point of view, to know about practical
applications and new software available, as well as to discuss lines for future
research.

The program, mixing oral presentations and open discussions, intends to foster
interaction so as to open the way to future cooperation between participants.
All researchers and teams who develop research or recently became interested in
this domain are invited.

Workshop language is English.


Looking forward to meeting you in Namur !

							    Paula Brito  & 
Monique Noirhomme-Fraiture
