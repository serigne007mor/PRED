  A First Call for papers
The Ninth International Conference on Simulated Evolution And Learning
(SEAL'2012)
16-19 December 2012, Ha Noi, Vietnam
<http://fit.lqdtu.edu.vn/seal2012/CFP.aspx>

*Hosted and Sponsored by*
Faculty of Information Technology, Le Quy Don Technical University

*http://fit.lqdtu.edu.vn/seal2012/CFP.aspx
*

*Aim and Scopes*

Evolution and learning are two fundamental forms of adaptation. SEAL'2012
is the ninth biennial conference in the highly successful series that aims
at exploring these two forms of adaptation and their roles and interactions
in adaptive systems. Cross-fertilization between evolutionary learning and
other machine learning approaches, such as neural network learning,
reinforcement learning, decision tree learning, fuzzy system learning,
etc., will be strongly encouraged by the conference. The other major theme
of the conference is optimization by evolutionary approaches or hybrid
evolutionary approaches. The topics of interest to this conference include
but are not limited to the following: Evolutionary Learning; Evolutionary
Optimization; Hybrid Learning; Adaptive Systems; Theoretical Issues in
Evolutionary Computation; Real-World Applications of Evolutionary
Computation Techniques.
*1. Evolutionary Learning *

   - Fundamental Issues in Evolutionary Learning
   - Co-Evolutionary Learning
   - Modular Evolutionary Learning Systems
   - Classifier System
   - Collective Intelligence
   - Representation Issues in Evolutionary Learning
   - Artificial Immune Systems
   - Interactions Between Learning and Evolution
   - Credit Assignment
   - Swarm Intelligence
   - Comparison between Evolutionary Learning and Other Learning Approaches

*2. Evolutionary Optimization *

   - Combinatorial Optimization
   - Numerical/Function Optimization
   - Hybrid Optimization Algorithms
   - Comparison of Algorithms
   - Nature-Inspired Algorithms (ant colony optimization, particle swarm
   optimization, memetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.)

*3. Hybrid Learning *

   - Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks
   - Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems
   - Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning
   - Evolutionary Clustering
   - Evolutionary Decision Tree Learning
   - Evolutionary Unsupervised Learning
   - Genetic Programming
   - Other Hybrid Learning Systems
   - Developmental Processes

*4. Adaptive Systems *

   - Complexity in Adaptive Systems
   - Evolutionary Robotics
   - Evolvable Hardware and Software
   - Artificial Ecology
   - Evolutionary Games
   - Self-Repairing Systems
   - Memetic Computing
   - Evolutionary Computation Techniques in Economics, Finance and
   Marketing

*5. Theoretical Issues in Evolutionary Computation *

   - Computational Complexity of Evolutionary Algorithms
   - Self-Adaptation in Evolutionary Algorithms
   - Convergence and Convergence Rate of Evolutionary Algorithms

*6. Real-World Applications of Evolutionary Computation Techniques
Publications*

All accepted papers which are presented at the conference will be included
in the conference proceedings, published as LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer
Science) by Springer (document format click
