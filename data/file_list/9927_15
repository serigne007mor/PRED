Subject: [liste-egc] Call for participation: Cloud Intelligence @VLDB 2012


***************************************************************
1st International Workshop on Cloud Intelligence (Cloud-I 2012)
***************************************************************
In conjunction with VLDB 2012, Istanbul, Turkey, August 31, 2012

http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/cloud-i/

**********************
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
**********************

With the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud business intelligence=
 "as a service" offerings have sparkled widely, both from cloud start-ups a=
nd major BI industry vendors. Beyond porting BI features into the cloud, wh=
ich already implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL database modeling =
and storage, data localization, security and privacy, performance, cost and=
 usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges for making=
 data analytics available to small and middle-size enterprises (SMEs), non-=
governmental organizations, web communities (e.g., supported by social netw=
orks), and even the average citizen; this vision presumably requiring a mix=
ture of both private and open data.

The aim of the Cloud-I workshop is to become an interdisciplinary, regular =
exchange forum for researchers, industry and practitioners, as well as all =
potential users of Cloud Intelligence. The submission of research, industri=
al, position, visionary and student papers are encouraged to fuel up the di=
scussion.
