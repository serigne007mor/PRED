The Biennial International Conference on Artificial Evolution=20=20
(EA-2011) will celebrate its 10th anniversary from 24 to 26 October=20=20
2011 in Angers, France.

*** Topics of interest ***
Authors are invited to submit original papers related, but not limited=20=20
to the following topics:

* Evolutionary computation, evolutionary optimization, co-evolution,=20=20
natural computing, soft computing.
* Nature or biologically-inspired paradigm (swarm intelligence,=20=20
artificial ants, artificial immune systems, cultural algorithms,=20=20
scatter search and path relinking, quantum annealing etc).
* Estimation of distribution algorithms and other methods based on=20=20
probabilistic models.
* Artificial Life, population dynamics.
* Theory, algorithm design and evaluation, implementations.
* Genetic Programming
* Application of evolutionary paradigms to the Real World=20=20
(biosciences, industry, social-economic sciences etc).Continuous and=20=20
global Optimization, combinatorial and discrete optimization.
* Multi-objective optimization, dynamic optimization, constraint handling.
* Memetic algorithms.
* Machine Learning and hybridization with other soft computing techniques.
* Bioinformatics
* Evolutionary robotics...

The 2011 edition will continue the tradition which has been=20=20
progressively established during its previous editions:

Quality: With a rigorous selection by a high profile International=20=20
Program Committee, the selected papers (12 pages, LNCS format) will be=20=20
