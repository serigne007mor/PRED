Subject: [liste-egc] PhD position in Visual Analytics at the University of
 Montpellier, France

DATA MINING AND INFORMATION VISUALIZATION FOR FACILITATING THE MEDICAL
ANALYSIS OF PATIENT MOVEMENT

Applications are invited for a funded PhD studentship in Visual
Analytics in the department of Computer Science at the University of
Montpellier, France.
http://www.lirmm.fr/~sallaberry/supervision/jobs/PhD-position.pdf

Location:
LIRMM Lab (http://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm_eng), Montpellier, France

Supervisors:
* Jerome Aze, Professor at LIRMM, University of Montpellier.
* Arnaud Sallaberry, Assistant Professor at LIRMM, University Paul
Valery Montpellier.

Context:
Recent technologies such as Kinect, Wiiboard, Tablet, Joypad, eye
tracking devices, etc., enable to record patient's behavior. For
medicine, analyzing this behavior is a key to establish efficient
diagnostics and better design recovery good practices. To perform a
strong diagnostic, data generated by recording devices (body movements,
eye movements, etc.) has to be analyzed taking account of the patient
background (health problem, personal information, etc.). In this
context, therapists are confronted to large amount of heterogeneous data
and their analyses require automatic methods. The difficulty lies not in
generating but rather in sifting through this mass raw of data in order
to discover patterns. This thesis focuses on designing data mining and
information visualization techniques to create interfaces helping
healthcare professionals to understand the data.

Subject:
A number of issues associated with the design of such interfaces will be
examined in the context of this thesis in order to provide therapists
with the tools necessary to perform their analyses. It is of utmost
importance that these interfaces be as simple and intuitive as possible,
as a misinterpretation of the data due to imperfect interface design
could hamper the rehabilitation process. It is for this reason that an
in-depth study of knowledge discovery methods must be undertaken by
experts in data mining, information visualization and human-computer
interaction, in close collaboration with therapists.

How to apply:
Interested candidates are requested to send an application by e-mail to
Dr. Arnaud Sallaberry, (arnaud.sallaberry@lirmm.fr) and Pr. Jerome Aze
(jerome.aze@lirmm.fr) with the subject field: '[PhD position] Visual
Analytics'. The application should consist of a motivation letter, a
curriculum vitae including major achievements, and two or more
recommendation letters.

Application deadline:
May 1st, 2015

If you have any questions please contact Dr. Arnaud Sallaberry,
(arnaud.sallaberry@lirmm.fr) and Pr. Jerome Aze (jerome.aze@lirmm.fr).
