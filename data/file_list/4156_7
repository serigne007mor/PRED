Subject: [liste-egc] IDA 2023 PhD track


The 21st International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) will 
take place April 12-14, 2023 in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

https://ida2023.org/

IDA is an international symposium dedicated to novel ideas for the 
intelligent analysis of data.

IDA wishes to encourage PhD students to participate in the symposium. 
For this reason, IDA 2023 offers a lower registration fee for PhD 
students and will include a mentorship program. PhD Students 
participating in this PhD program will be able to present their ongoing 
PhD project to the IDA audience; they will be paired with experienced 
researchers and meetings will be arranged during the symposium to allow 
for discussion between the students and mentors.
Participation in this forum requires submitting an application by 17 
February 2023, which will be evaluated by the chair of the PhD forum.

More information about the PhD forum can be found here:

https://ida2023.org/phd-forum/

Also check out the list of accepted papers to get an idea of what IDA is 
about:

https://ida2023.org/accepted-papers/

The application consists of a one-page pdf containing the names and 
affiliations of all authors (the PhD student, as well as his/her 
supervisor(s), advisor(s) and/or main collaborators), as well as an 
abstract (ca. 500 words max) and an indication of the chosen medium(s) 
of presentation (poster, video or demo, see the website). In case your 
submission is accepted for presentation you will be required to make the 
corresponding presentation material available online and share a URL 
link one week prior to the conference, i.e. before April 5, 2023.
