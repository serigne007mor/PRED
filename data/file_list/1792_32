AIMLAI@CIKM2020: International Workshop on Advances in Interpretable Machin=
e Learning and Artificial Intelligence=20

Submission deadline: (originally July 22nd) July 29th, 2020=20

** Description **=20

The purpose of AIMLAI (Advances in Interpretable Machine Learning and Artif=
icial Intelligence) is to encourage principled research leading to the adva=
ncement of explainable, transparent, ethical and fair data mining, machine =
learning, and artificial intelligence. AIMLAI is a workshop that seeks top-=
quality submissions addressing uncovered important issues related to explai=
nable and interpretable data mining and machine learning models. Papers sho=
uld present research results in any of the topics of interest for the works=
hop as well as application experiences, tools and promising preliminary ide=
as. AIMLAI asks for contributions from researchers, in academia or industry=
, working on topics addressing these challenges primarily from a technical =
point of view, but also from a legal, ethical or sociological perspective. =
Besides the central topic of interpretable algorithms and explanation metho=
ds, we also welcome submissions that answer the following two research ques=
tions: (i) "how to measure and evaluate interpretability and explainability=
?" and (ii) "how to integrate humans in the machine learning pipeline for i=
nterpretability purposes?".=20

** Topics **=20

Interpretable ML=20
Supervised ML (classifiers, regressors, =E2=80=A6)=20
Unsupervised ML (clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualisation, =E2=
=80=A6)=20
Explaining recommendation systems=20
Transparency in AI and ML=20
Ethical aspects=20
Legal aspects=20
Fairness issues=20
Methodology and formalization of interpretability=20
Formal measures of interpretability=20
Interpretability/complexity trade-offs=20
How to evaluate interpretability=20
User-centric interpretability=20
Interpretability modules: generating explanations for ML and AI algorithms=
=20
Semantic interpretability: how to add semantics to explanations=20
Human-in-the-loop to construct and/or evaluate interpretable models=20
Integration of ML algorithms, infovis and man-machine interfaces=20


** Submission Guidelines **=20

Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the ACM procee=
dings format. Overlength papers will be rejected without review (papers wit=
h smaller page margins and font sizes than specified in the author instruct=
ions and set in the style files will also be treated as overlength).=20

Authors who submit their work to AIMLAI 2020 commit themselves to present t=
heir paper at the workshop in case of acceptance. AIMLAI 2020 considers the=
 author list submitted with the paper as final. No additions or deletions t=
o this list may be made after paper submission, either during the review pe=
riod, or in case of acceptance, at the final camera ready stage.=20

Condition for inclusion in the post-proceedings is that at least one of the=
 co-authors has presented the paper at the workshop. Pre-proceedings will b=
e available online before the workshop. All papers for AIMLAI 2020 must be =
submitted to the on-line submission system at [ https://easychair.org/confe=
rences/?conf=3Daimlaicikm20 | https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daim=
laicikm20 ] .=20

** Venue **=20

The conference will be co-located with the conference CIKM, which will be h=
eld online on October 19th-23rd, 2020. The workshop will be online as well =
and will take place on October 19th.=20


** Publication **=20

All accepted papers will be published as post-proceedings and included in a=
 CIKM companion volume published by [ http://ceur-ws.org/ | http://ceur-ws.=
