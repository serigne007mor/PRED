ISCRAM-med'2015:
Second International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis
Response and Management in Mediterranean Countries

http://www.riadi.rnu.tn/iscrammed2015/ [1]
Conference Dates: October 28-30 2015
Tunis, Tunisia

--------------------------------------------------------------
The Second International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis
Response and Management in Mediterranean Countries (ISCRAM-med 2015), is
a multidisciplinary conference organized in Mediterranean countries. The
first ISCRAM-med conference was successfully held in Toulouse, France
(October, 15-17, 2014). 
The objectives of the ISCRAM-Med Conference are to provide an
outstanding opportunity and an international forum for local and
international researchers, practitioners and policy makers to address
and discuss new trends and challenges in the area of Information Systems
for Crisis Response and Disaster Management. 
Similarly to the international ISCRAM conference (its 12th edition was
held in May 2015 in Norway), the aim of ISCRAM-Med is to focus on crises
and disasters (natural or man-made) and the solutions (computer-based or
not) required to be effective and efficient according to the disaster
phases, types and scales. A special focus on Mediterranean related
experiences will be considered. More than ever, it becomes crucial to
enhance multidisciplinary collaborations. Crises in this region should
be studied in a participatory way following a holistic and systemic
approach at a Mediterranean level, rather than as isolated phenomena. 
Attendees are invited to present and share their experiences, their
recent research results, best practices, case studies, and also tool
demonstrations related to social, technical and practical aspects of all
information and communication systems used or to be used in all phases
of management of emergencies, disasters and crises. 
ISCRAM-med 2015 will include a high quality scientific program:

KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
- Mauro DOLCE, Professor of Structural Engineering at the University of
Naples Federico II and General Director at the Italian Department of
Civil Protection, Rome, Italy
- Nissaf BEN ALAYA, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine and
Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, General Director of the
Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases, National observatory of new
emerging diseases, Tunis, Tunisia.

PAPERS will be published as LNBIP series by Springer (Series: Lecture
Notes in Business Information Processing, Vol. 233;
http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319243986 [2]) 

Eighteen selected papers (involving 66 authors from 16 countries) are
related to the preparedness and response phases of a disaster management
lifecycle and are organized according to five main topics: (1) Social
Computing , (2) Modelling and Simulation, (3) Information and Knowledge
Management, (4) Engineering of Emergency Management Systems, (5)
Decision Support Systems and Collaboration.
