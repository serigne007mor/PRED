------ Call For Papers ------------------------------------------
The 23rd ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2008) March 16-20, 2008,
Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil
-----------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2008/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Track on ADVANCES IN SPATIAL AND IMAGE-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ASIIS 08)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/DBconf/ASIIS/

-- Description
Spatial and Image-based information systems are increasingly at the heart of
novel applications, raising new challenges in complex spatial data modeling,
spatial data and image sharing, emergent geo-spatial data semantics. ASIIS is a
track of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2008). For the past twenty
years the ACM SAC symposium has been a primary and international forum for
applied computer scientists, computer engineers and application developers
to interact and present their work. The ASIIS track aims to foster
interdisciplinary discussions and research in various aspects of spatial and
image based information systems.

The topics of interest should be related to spatial- and image-based systems,
they include but are not limited to:

 * Conceptual modeling for visual information systems
 * Image databases and mining
 * Geographical information systems
 * Spatial data modeling
 * Multiple representations
 * Spatial and spatio-temporal indexing
 * Spatial and Image based metadata & ontologies
 * Spatial reasoning
 * Semantic web and spatial data applications
 * Ontologies for spatial information systems
 * Grid computing for spatial and image-based IS
 * Retrieval and visualization systems
 * Features and index extraction
 * Interoperability and standards
 * Traffic telematics
 * Location-based services
 * Visual languages
 * Languages for metadata management
 * Query processing and optimization
 * Novel and challenging applications


-- Submission guidelines
You are invited to submit papers not exceeding 4000 words (approx. 10 pages
single-spaced) including diagrams and references with at least 10-point Times
Roman like font. Since a "blind" paper evaluation method will be used, authors
are kindly requested to produce and provide the full paper, WITHOUT any
reference to any of the authors. The manuscript must contain, in its first
page, the paper title, an abstract and a list of keywords but NO NAMES OR
CONTACT DETAILS WHATSOEVER are to be included in any part of this file. Authors
should submit a full paper via electronic Submission. Each paper will undergo a
formal peer review process on the basis of technical quality, originality,
clarity,and relevance to the track topics above.

Accepted papers will be included in the SAC 08 conference proceedings published
by ACM. The final version of all accepted papers must be within 5 pages
prepared using ACM two-column format. One of the authors of each accepted paper
must attend the ACM SAC 08 symposium.

Papers should be submitted using the electronic submission system
(http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2008/SubmitAbstract.aspx?TrackID=85).
Contact Richard CHBEIR if you encounter any problem when submitting.

Selected papers will be considered for possible publication in several journals.

-- Important Dates

 September 16, 2007:        Submission of papers (revised)
 October 19, 2007:         Notification of Acceptance/Rejection (revised)
