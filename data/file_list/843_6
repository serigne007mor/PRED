CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

OWLED 2007
OWL: Experiences and Directions
http://owled2007.iut-velizy.uvsq.fr/

Third International Workshop
Innsbruck, Austria
6-7 June 2007
==================================================

The W3C OWL Web Ontology Language has been a W3C recommendation since 2004.
The OWL: Experiences and Direction (OWLED) workshop series is a forum
for practitioners in industry and academia, tool developers, and
others interested in OWL to describe real and potential applications,
to share their experiences, and to discuss requirements for language
extensions/modifications. At OWLED 2006 it was agreed to move forward
with a member submission of the OWL 1.1 proposal which extends OWL DL
in ways that have been requested by users, that have effective
reasoning algorithms, and that developers of OWL reasoning systems are
willing to support.
The 3rd OWL: Experiences and Directions workshop (OWLED 2007) will
again bring users, implementors and researchers together in order to
measure the current state of need against the state of the art and to
set an agenda for language evolutions that satisfy users. OWLED 2007
shall in particular present industrial efforts and experiences with
OWL. It shall further the interaction between industry, theoreticians
and tool builders, help consolidate OWL 1.1, clarify the relationships
between OWL and rules and initiate the specification of OWL 2.0.
Building on the success of the 2005 OWLED and the 2006 OWLED workshops, the
OWLED 2007 will again immediately follow one of the main Semantic
Web conferences, namely the ESWC conference, and is co-located with the
First International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems, RR2007.

OWLED 2007 presentations and discussions will focus on all aspects of OWL
and it's extensions, applications, theories, methods, tools; including
but not limited to the following topics:
- All applications of OWL
- Application-driven requirements for OWL
- Implementation techniques for OWL and related languages
- Performance and scalability issues
- Bridges between knowledge engineering and OWL
- Non-standard inference services, including explanations, static
verification, modularity
- Enriching ontologies with rules
- Query answering and data integration
- Tools for OWL including: editors, visualisation tools, parsers and syntax
checkers, versioning frameworks
- Extensions to OWL including: extended datatype constructors, property
constructors, class constructors keys, constraints, rules probabilistic and
fuzzy extensions, non-monotonic extensions, temporal and spatial extensions

The preliminary programme is available on the OWLED 2007 Website,
at http://owled2007.iut-velizy.uvsq.fr/. More details will be forthcoming
shortly on the site.

OWLED is a highly interactive workshop where discussion is the main
focus, rather than presentation.  Three panels are scheduled for extensive
discussions on current hot topics.
- SPARQL, Rules, and OWL
- Adopting OWL in Industry - What is needed?
- Life Sciences: Lessons, Formats, Future Developments?
*All* attendees, whether those with accepted papers or not, are
encouraged to give Demos of their work during the poster/demo session.
It is also possible to hang "informal" posters on current works at the
poster session.

NOTE: Registrations fee are really low!
If you register before the 26th May 2007 you are eligible for the early
registration fee:
- £90 (~ 134 EUR) for full registration
- £35 (~ 52 EUR) for student registration

From the 26th May 2007, the registration fee is
- £125 (~ 180 EUR) for full registration
- £55 (~ 80 EUR) for student registration

We are excited to announce that a buffet offered by OWLED 2007 will take
place on 6th June evening during the Poster/Demo.

OWLED 2007 will be hosted in the heart of Alps, at Innsbruck unique city of
Tirol!
