ECML PKDD 2010 - Call for Demonstrations

The European Conference on Machine Learning and
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases

http://www.ecmlpkdd2010.org/articles-mostra-2085-eng-demos.htm

======================================================================

We invite submissions for demos of working systems based on
state-of-the-art machine-learning and data-mining technology.

At ECML PKDD 2010 a special demonstration session will be held, an
exciting and highly interactive way to showcase the state of the art
in machine learning and knowledge discovery software. Accepted
demonstration papers will be published in the conference proceedings
(4 pages).

The focus will be on innovative prototype implementations, systems,
and technologies in machine learning and data analysis, concerned with
(non-exhaustive list):

    * Information retrieval
    * Text and language analysis/processing
    * Media (image/video/audio/...) analysis/processing
    * Visual data mining
    * Mobile applications
    * Sensor networks
    * Robotics
    * e-Science
    * Industrial applications
    * Business intelligence
    * Multimodal HCI, including Brain Computer Interfaces

Submissions will be judged by a committee of technical experts with
expertise in machine learning, data mining, and software
engineering. Selection criteria include the relevance of the
contribution, its interest and usefulness for attendees, and its
technical difficulty. Special attention will be devoted to open-source
software, although not a requirement for submission.

Accepted contributions: At least one of the authors must register for
and attend the conference in order to present the demonstration
(precisions about demonstrations to be given with the acceptance
notification).


======================================================================
Submissions

Each demonstration should be accompanied by a short paper of at most 4
pages (including figures and screenshots if needed). The paper must be
in English and must be formatted according to the Springer-Verlag
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence guidelines. Authors
instructions and style files can be downloaded at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Please submit your paper electronically until May 14 to
demos@ecmlpkdd2010.org


In this accompanying paper, please try to answer the following
questions: What makes your piece of software unique and special? What
are the innovative aspects or in what way/area does it represent the
state of the art? For whom is it most interesting/useful? (an ML or
KDD researcher, a graduate or undergraduate student in these areas, an
industrial practitioner etc.) If there are similar/related pieces of
software: What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to these
related software?


======================================================================
Important Dates

Submission deadline: May 14
Notifications: June 7
Final versions due: June 21


======================================================================
Contact

In case you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact the
Demo Chairs Ulf Brefeld and Xavier Carreras via demos@ecmlpkdd2010.org
