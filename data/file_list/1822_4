Scientific project

Modeling interaction is a crucial step for Natural Language Processing=20=

(NLP), which requires the development of automatic tools able to=20
simulate these exchanges. A typical example is chatbots and all the=20
services based on them. But Dialogue Models face two types of =
difficulties.

(I) The first issue concerns the availability of resources and models=20
that can analyze and process dialogues. Modeling dialogues is very=20
hard, in particular because conversations highlight particular uses=20
such as the relationship between questions and answers. Another=20
perspective is to use Machine Learning approaches in order to identify=20=

dialogical relations and dialogical interactions. Generally speaking=20
discursive analysis aims at building a structure representing the=20
semantic links between sentences.

(II) The second is that dialogue models must be coordinated with=20
pragmatic inferences at a higher level. In this case, we can refer to=20
linguistic models of dialogue, or to models that capture conceptual
links, such as in TTR. While speech models provide important
information, dialogue makes it possible to share information in a=20
more sophisticated way. The solution must take into account the=20
background of all speakers, as well as how they have common ground.

**************
Candidate skills

The post-doctoral fellow must have either a PhD in Computational=20
Linguistics/NLP, Computer Science or related fields, with good=20
programming skills, OR in Psychology.=20
He/She must be fluent in English and have demonstrated its ability=20
to publish at the highest international level. Note that Knowledge of=20

French is NOT required.
Supervision of students is possible, if wanted.
