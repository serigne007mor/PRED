The Data Mining and Machine Learning group (DM2L) at LIRIS laboratory 
(UMR 5205 CNRS) invites applications for a *PhD position in Machine 
Learning.*

*Context*

This is a *European project* entitled "Integrated Solutions for Agile 
Manufacturing in High-mix Semiconductor Fabs" (INTEGRATE) with 28 
European partners in which one PhD student will be funded for 3 years. 
The INTEGRATE project aims to enhance European semiconductor fabs 
efficiency by providing methods and tools to better control the process 
variability, reduce the cycle time and enhance the effectiveness of the 
production equipment.  The PhD student will develop powerful machine 
learning algorithms for analyzing large unbalanced data sets including 
sensor data streams (at varying temporal resolution), selecting and 
extracting features, assessing their relevance and performing both fault 
detection and fault classification in a supervised or semi-supervised 
context.

*Work environment*

Lyon is France's second largest city and capital of the Rhône-Alpes 
region. Combining an exceptional historical heritage with a natural 
liking for good food, Lyon is an ideal city for discovering all the 
charm of the French way of life. A stage for more than 2000 years of 
history, the city has a remarkable architectural heritage. Expanding 
towards the east throughout the centuries, without destroying the 
existing areas, 500 hectares of its city centre became a Unesco World 
Heritage Site in 1998.

*University Lyon 1* is one of the leading academic communities in 
France. Renowned for its leafy campus (443,000 m2), and state-of-the-art 
equipment, it enrols over 35, 000 students in approximately hundreds of 
study programs. University Lyon 1 employs 2630 researchers and teachers.

The *Data Mining and Machine Learning group* (DM2L) at LIRIS laboratory 
(UMR 5205 CNRS), focuses on the development of principled approaches to 
machine learning and  data mining, and their applications to diverse 
areas including bioinformatics, anomaly detection, forecasting, process 
monitoring, medical diagnosis etc. DM2L currently consists of 12 
researchers and 5 PhD students.
*
Project description*

State-of-the-art semiconductor processes are often pushed to the limits 
of the current technology, resulting in processes that have little or no 
margin for error. Increasingly there is a need for fast, accurate, and 
sensitive detection and classification of equipment and process faults 
to maintain high process yields and high throughput in manufacturing. 
Detection of process and tool faults in the shortest time possible is 
critical to minimize scrap wafers and improve product yields for 
semiconductor manufacturing. Recently there has been a move towards 
fault detection directly on the manufacturing tool, through monitoring 
of tool-state data and in-situ process-state sensor data. Many 
manufacturing tools are beginning to have the ability to collect a large 
amount of data in real-time, which can be then accessed for tool fault 
detection. Unfortunately, with such an abundant amount of data 
available, it is often difficult to extract useful information such as 
when the tool is no longer operating properly (i.e. detecting a fault). 
Over the past years, a number of machine learning techniques have 
emerged to process large amounts of data and convert them to useful 
information. Several of these are starting to gain usage for tool fault 
detection. Once the fault is detected, the fault must be classified for 
some assignable cause, which ultimately must be corrected before the 
tool is returned to normal operation. Classification of the cause of the 
fault is equally critical to detecting the fault, because rapid 
classification and corrective action will lead to minimized tool 
downtime and increased throughput.

The PhD candidate will focus on automating the fault classification with 
powerful machine supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches 
(e.g. graphical models, SVMs, neural nets, ensemble methods) for 
automatically classifying faults based on historical data and 
identifying some fault signature. The overall aim is to detect and 
classify faults faster and more accurately, resulting in improved 
process yields and higher throughput, while controlling the false alarm 
rate.

*What we expect from you*

You should meet the following requirements:
.    A Master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Electrical 
Engineering or Statistics with a strong interest in machine learning, 
pattern recognition and data analysis;
.    Strong programming skills in R or Matlab;
.    Good knowledge in probability and statistical inference;
.    Commitment and a cooperative attitude;
.    Excellent proficiency in written and spoken English.

If you are interested in this position, please provide a detailed 
curriculum vitae, a short explanation of your interest in the proposed 
research topic, a list of courses (including grades) that you have 
successfully completed, a publication list, copy of your publication(s) 
in English and the names of two references, and all other information 
that might be relevant to your application

Please send your application by mail *not later than June 30th* to:
