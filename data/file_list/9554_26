Web Science is concerned with the full scope of socio-technical
relationships that are engaged in the World Wide Web. It is based on the
notion that understanding the Web involves not only an analysis of its
architecture and applications, but also insight into the people,
organizations, policies, and economics that are affected by and subsumed
within it. As such Web Science, and thus this conference, is inherently
interdisciplinary and integrates computer and information sciences,
sociology, economics, political science, law, management, language and
communication, geography and psychology. This conference is unique in
the manner in which it brings these disciplines together in creative and
critical dialogue and we invite papers from all these disciplines and
those which cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.=20=20

Following the success of WebSci'09 in Athens and WebSci'10 in Raleigh we
are seeking papers that demonstrate the development, scope, and
relevance of the emerging field of Web Science. Possible topics for
submissions include:

* On-line lives: individuals and organizations shopping, dating,
  learning, networking
* Trust and privacy
* Evolving technologies -- new search technologies, linked data, new Web
  languages and/or protocols, and emerging application areas
* The pro-human web in an unequal world: access, inequalities and
  agendas for change
* Web futures: possibilities critiques and challenges
* The web and the state: nationalism, politics. democracy
* Governance control and power
* Knowledge, education, and scholarship--the potential and effects of
  crowdsourcing and long tails
* Intellectual property and the Commons
* The dark side of the Web--such as cybercrime, pornography and
  terrorism
