Autumn school Artificial Intelligence and Education


17-25 October, Nancy, France

	!! Pre-registration before 4th October !!

Overview

With the generalization of Artificial Intelligence, the field of =
education is changing fundamentally. AI contributes to the appearance of =
new ways to teach and learn, which can make the educational experience =
more efficient and engaging. For example, it is a way to solve the =C2=AB =
one size fits all =C2=BB problem faced by traditional teaching.

Artificial Intelligence is thus becoming a hot topic in education.  =
Keywords as customisation, dashboards, intelligent tutors, learning =
analytics, quality improvement, student motivation, engagement, etc. are =
now buzz words in the domain.

However, introducing AI in education cannot come down to designing and =
using AI tools. Dimensions such as pedagogy, social and educational =
sciences, psychology also have to be considered. AI in education is =
therefore a multidisciplinary domain.

As part of the =E2=80=9CAI and Education: Modeling real-world =
problems=E2=80=9D autumn school, we aim to understand, foster and =
support the development of AI in education, by considering several =
disciplines, topics and points of view, from theoretical to practical =
problems.

To this end, the school provides basic concepts, state-of-the-art and =
new insights in several domains, such as educational data mining, =
statistical learning, knowledge management, user (teacher/learner) =
experience, co-design, personalised stakeholders support, acceptance, =
adoption, evaluation, etc., considering obviously the links between =
them.

The summer school will proceed in three successive phases:

=46rom 17th October to 21st October, researchers in the field of =
education and AI will give lectures covering a broad range of the =
previously mentioned topics. Interaction between instructors and =
participants will highly be encouraged during these lectures.
22nd October and 23rd October, participants will attend the LSAC =
conference, dedicated to =E2=80=93 talks by researchers, practitioners =
and industrials of practical experiments as well as theoretical =
proposals, - discussions about privacy, ethics and policies.
24th October and 25th October participants will take part in a two-days =
datathon to apply the notions presented in the preceding week. =
Multidisciplinary teams will compete on an innovative real-world problem =
with real data. The winning team will receive a prize worth 300 euros.

The =E2=80=98AI and Education: Modeling real-world problems=E2=80=99 =
summer school will be held as a co-located event of the LSAC conference =
from Thursday the 17th  of October  to Friday the 25th of October, in =
Nancy, France.

Target Audience

Any practitioner, Ph.D. student, post-doc, researcher, or Master =
student, interested in AI or in education is invited to attend the =
school, whatever is his/her main area of knowledge (education, =
psychology, computer science, etc.). As it is a multidisciplinary =
school, no specific background is required to attend it, an interest in =
all disciplines will be appreciated.

Originality of the Summer School


The school involves three phases, from theoretic (first phase) to =
practical (datathon), through discussions and presentations of practical =
experiences by researchers and teachers. It will be rich and dynamic.
The school is multidisciplinary, the main discipline of the participants =
will range from computer science to psychology and includes education, =
statistics, etc. This diversity of topics and the variety of =
participants will make this school full of fruitful discussions and =
works.

Social events

Four social events the autumn school will take place during the autumn =
school.


On Thursday the 17th: an opening cocktail that will be the opportunity =
for the attendees to start knowing each other.
On Sunday the 20th: a visit to Nancy City. You will discover our nice =
city, UNESCO classified for its 18th century Place Stanislas.
On Tuesday, the 22nd: a gala dinner with attendees of the LSAC =
conference.
On Wednesday the 23rd: a dinner with all the participants of the =
datathon. New attendees will join us, you will meet each of them, and =
start discussions with your teammates and other teams.=20

How to Pre-register and register, registration fees

Participation at the autumn school requires pre-registration via: =
http://enquetes.univ-lorraine.fr/index.php/883718?lang=3Den =
<http://enquetes.univ-lorraine.fr/index.php/883718?lang=3Den>. Some =
slots are still available.

The autumn school has a limited number of places, so the allocation of =
places will be on a first-come, first-served basis.

Pre-registration will remain open until the capacity limit is reached.

Reserving an accommodation lies in the responsibility of participants, =
recommended dormitories and hotels are on the website.

=20
Registration fees

Registration fees include coffee breaks (twice each day) and lunch for =
each day (except Sunday 20th), and the four social events. We will =
probably be able to include dinner for each day in the registration =
fees.

Registration closes on 11th October.
