2014 IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award: Professor Jian Pei
(http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/)

The IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award is the highest recognition for r=
esearch achievements in Data Mining, and is given to one individual or one =
group who has made influential research contributions to the field of Data =
Mining. The 2014 IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award goes to Professor J=
ian Pei of Simon Fraser University, Canada.

Jian Pei is a Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) and a Professor of Computing S=
cience at Simon Fraser University, Canada, and a Fellow of the IEEE. His re=
search has focused on effective and efficient approaches to analyze and cap=
italize on big data in various applications. He has published prolifically =
over the core frontiers of data mining, including pattern mining, classific=
ation, clustering, anomaly detection and outlier analysis. His technical pu=
blications have been cited extensively, tens of thousands of times.

Professor Pei has made prominent contributions to the foundation, principle=
s and applications of data mining. Together with his collaborators, he deve=
loped a series of ground-breaking frequent pattern mining methods, which ha=
ve been adopted by popular data mining textbooks and used by many researche=
rs and in industry applications. He is also proactive and strategic in exte=
nding the boundary of data mining. He contributed the major ideas of multid=
imensional skyline analysis, a well-seasoned integration of ideas and metho=
ds from data mining and databases.

In addition to his fundamental technical contributions, Professor Pei has a=
lso made exemplary and invaluable contributions in service to the data mini=
ng research community through journal editorship and key organizers of prem=
ier data mining conferences.
