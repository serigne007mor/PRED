Aim and Scope

Modeling and analyzing networks is a major emerging topic in different
research areas, such as computational biology, social science, document
retrieval, etc. Nowadays, the scientific communities have access to huge
volumes of network-structured data, such as social networks, gene/proteins/
metabolic networks, sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks. Most often,
these data are not only static, but they are collected at different time
points. This dynamic view of the system allows the time component to play a
key role in the comprehension of the evolutionary behavior of the network.

Handling such data is a major challenge for current research in machine
learning and data mining, and it has led to the development of recent
innovative techniques that consider complex/multi-level networks,
time-evolving graphs, heterogeneous information (nodes and links), and
requires scalable algorithms that are able to manage huge and complex
networks.

DyNaK workshop is motivated by the interest of providing a meeting point for
scientists with different backgrounds that are interested in the study of
large complex networks and the dynamic aspects of such networks. It aims at
attracting contributions from both aspects of networks analysis: large real
network analysis and modeling, and knowledge discovery within those
networks.

Paper Submission

We welcome original contributions, either theoretical or empirical,
describing  ongoing projects or completed work (even partially published).
The instructions for authors and the LaTeX packages can be found at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Paper length should not exceed 12 pages.

Following the first edition of DyNak workshop, a special issue of the
International journal of Intelligent Data Analysis has been published. We
expect to do the same for this second edition.
