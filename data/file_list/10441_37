Subject: [liste-egc] CfP for the Special Session on Visual Data Clustering
 at IV2015

[/Please distribute/widely and/accept our apologies for cross/-/posting/.]

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to cordially invite you to submit a paper for the special
session on

Advances in Interactive and Visual Data Clustering

http://www.graphicslink.co.uk/IV2015/AIVDAC.htm

organized within 19th International Conference Information Visualisation

http://www.graphicslink.co.uk/IV2015/

================================
Call for Papers
================================

iV2015 - AiVDC 4rd International Symposium
Advances in Interactive and Visual Data Clustering

21, 22, 23 and 24 July 2015
The University of Barcelona ● Barcelona ● Spain ●

=======
Scope:
=======

Visual and interactive approaches have been developed for data
clustering since several decades now with the aim of improving the
discovery of clusters in unlabelled data. With the new challenges that
result from the accumulation of large and distributed datasets,
efficient visual data clustering requires the study and implementation
of new and advanced able to learn from big data that come from real-life
applications.

While the need for clustering is evident, few solutions exist today for
Big data. The aim of this symposium is to let researchers make a state
of the art, discuss their ideas, present recent advances and results
within the context of data clustering and visualizations or interactive
methods.

The scope of the symposium will cover all aspects of visual and
interactive data clustering. This includes many different issues like:

- How can the domain expert create clusters from an interactive
visualization of large and/or distributed data ?
- How visual techniques should be redesigned to handle big data ?
- How can standard clustering algorithms be combined and improved with
visualizations and interactions ?
- What methods may efficiently reorganize a visual structure in order to
let clusters appear ?
- What are the recent and successful applications of visual data
clustering ?

Topics covered, but not limited to, include:

- Visualization of clusters: maps, dendrograms, trees, matrices,
1D/2D/3D/nD...
- Clustering algorithm that produce visual results: Self-Organizing
Maps, hierarchical agglomerative clustering,biomimetic algorithms,
proximity graphs
- Cooperation between clustering and visualization algorithms
- Visualization and bi-clustering
- Reorganization of visualizations, rearrangement clustering, matrix or
tree reordering
- Interactive discovery of clusters, other interactions with clusters in
visualization
- Visual analytics and data clustering
- Handling large and complex data: Bioinformatics, Social networks,
attributes-values, sequences, trees, graphs
- Parallel Visualization of Big and Stream data
- Parallel Implementation of visual clustering approaches (Cloud, CPU, GPU)
- User and case studies
