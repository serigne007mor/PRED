CFP: 9th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC12)=20

[apologies for cross posting]=20

CFP ESWC12 - 9th Extended Semantic Web Conference=20
May 27 - 31, 2012=20

Info at: http://http://2012.eswc-conferences.org/=20

The mission of ESWC is to bring together researchers and practitioners=20
dealing with different aspects of semantic technologies. Building on its=20
past success, ESWC is seeking to broaden its focus to span other=20
relevant research areas in which semantics in a Web context plays an=20
important role. The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a Web of=20
knowledge and services in which the semantics of content is made=20
explicit and content is linked to both other content and services. This=20
network of knowledge-based functionality will weave together a large=20
network of human knowledge, and make this knowledge machine-processable=20
to support intelligent behaviour by machines. It will support novel=20
applications allowing to combine content from heterogeneous sites in=20
unforeseen ways and support enhanced matching between users needs and=20
content.=20

Creating such an interlinked Web of knowledge which spans unstructured,=20
RDF as well as multimedia content and services requires the=20
collaboration of many disciplines, including but not limited to:=20
Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Database and=20
Information Systems, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning,=20
Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social Networks, Web Engineering, and=20
Web Science.=20

In addition to the research and in-use tracks, we have furthermore=20
introduced two special tracks this year, putting particular emphasis on=20
inter-disciplinary research topics and areas that show the potential of=20
exciting synergies for the future.=20

*Important Dates*=20

Abstract submission December 5th, 2011=20
Full-paper submission December 12th, 2011=20
Notification of acceptance/rejection February 22nd, 2012=20
Camera-ready papers March 9th, 2012=20

*Additional Information*=20

ESWC2012 welcomes the submission of original research and application=20
papers dealing with all aspects of representing and using semantics on=20
the Web. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and=20
applications papers. The proceedings of this conference will be=20
published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Paper=20
submission and reviewing for ESWC2012 will be electronic via the=20
conference submissions site. Each paper must be assigned to one of the=20
tracks below:=20

Research tracks=20
- Ontologies (Chairs: Chiara Ghidini, Dimitris Plexousakis)=20
- Reasoning (Chairs: Giovambattista Ianni, Markus Kroetzsch)=20
- Semantic Data Management (Chairs: Claudio Gutierrez, Andreas Harth)=20
- Linked Open Data (Chairs: S=F6ren Auer, Juan Sequeda)=20
- Social Web and Web Science (Chairs: Fabien Gandon, Matthew Rowe)=20
- Software, Services, Processes and Cloud Computing (Chairs: Mathias=20
Klusch, Carlos Pedrinaci)=20
- Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval (Chairs: Paul=20
Buitelaar, Johanna V=F6lker)=20
- Mobile and Sensor Web (Chairs: Alasdair J G Gray, Kerry Taylor)=20
- Machine Learning (Chairs: Claudia D'Amato, Volker Tresp)=20

Special tracks 2012=20
- EGovernment: Using Semantics for Promoting Interoperability in the=20
Public Sector (Chairs: Asunci=F3n Gomez-Perez, Vassilios Peristeras)=20
- Digital Libraries and Cultural Heritage (Chairs: Antoine Isaac,=20
Vivienne Petras)=20

In-use & Industrial track=20
- In-use & Industrial track (Chairs: Philippe Cudre-Mauroux, Yves Raimond)=
=20

Check the website for detailed descriptions of each of these tracks.=20

Papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be=20
formatted according to the information for LNCS authors. Papers must be=20
submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format and will not=20
be accepted in any other format. Papers that exceed 15 pages or do not=20
follow the LNCS guidelines risk being rejected automatically without a=20
review. Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic=20
annotations for the abstract of their submission - details of this=20
process will be provided on the conference Web page at the time of=20
acceptance. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for=20
the conference. More information about the Springer's Lecture Notes in=20
Computer Science (LNCS) are available on the Springer LNCS Web site=20
( http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors ).=20

Submission will be through the Easychair system:=20
