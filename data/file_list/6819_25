General:

Data management, knowledge discovery as well as knowledge processing are core
and hot topics in computer science. They are widely accepted as enabling
technologies for modern enterprises enhancing their performance, especially
in the decision making process. Since the 1990s the Internet has been the
outstanding driving force for application development in all domains.

An increase in the demand of resource sharing (e.g. computing resources,
services, metadata, data sources) across different sites connected through
networks leads to an evolvement of data and knowledge management systems from
centralized systems to decentralized systems enabling large scale distributed
applications providing high scalability. Current decentralized systems still
focus on data and knowledge as their main resource characterized by:

- Heterogeneity of nodes, data and knowledge
- Autonomy of data and knowledge sources and services
- Large scale data volumes, high numbers of data sources, users, computing
   resources
- Dynamics of nodes.

Considering these characteristics recognize:

(a) limitations of methods and techniques developed for centralized systems
(b) requirements to extend or design new approaches and methods enhancing
     efficiency, dynamics and scalability
(c) development of large scale, experimental platforms and relevant benchmarks
     to evaluate and validate scaling

Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) techniques
and agent systems supporting with scaling and decentralized control. Synergy
between Grids, P2P systems and agent technologies is the key to data and
knowledge centered systems in large scale environments.

The objective of the international journal on Large Scale Data and Knowledge
Centered Systems is to provide an opportunity to disseminate original research
contributions and a high quality communication platform for researchers and
practitioners. The journal contains sound peer reviewed papers (research, stateof the art and technical) of high quality.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * Data Storage and Management
    * Data Integration and Metadata Management
    * Data Stream Systems
    * Data/Web Semantics and Ontologies
    * Knowledge Engineering and Processing
    * Sensor Data and Sensor Network
    * Dynamic Data Placement Issues
    * Query Processing and Optimization
    * Flexible, Robust and Adaptive Query Processing
    * Support for Scalable and Elastic Services
    * Data Warehousing
    * Cost Models
    * Resource Discovery
    * Resource Management, Reservation, and Scheduling
    * Locating Data Sources/Resources and Scalability
    * Workload Adaptability in Heterogeneous Environments
    * Transaction Management
    * Replicated Copy Control and Caching
    * Data Privacy and Security
    * Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
    * Mobile Data Management
    * Data Grid Systems
    * P2P Systems
    * Web Services
    * Autonomic Data Management
    * Large Scale Distributed Applications and Experiences
