* 7th International Workshop on Quality in Databases (QDB'09)
* In conjunction with VLDB 2009
* August 24th, 2009, Lyon, France

FOCUS
---------
The problem of poor data quality in databases, data warehousing and
information  systems largely and indistinctly affects every application
domain. Many data processing tasks (such as information integration,
data sharing, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery from
databases) require various forms of data preparation and
consolidation with complex data processing techniques, because
the data input to the algorithms is assumed to conform to nice data
distributions, containing no missing, inconsistent, duplicate or incorrect
values. This leaves a large gap between the available "dirty" data and
the available machinery to process the data for the application
purposes. Building on the established tradition of 6 previous
international workshops on the topic of Data and Information Quality,
namely IQIS 2004-2006, CleanDB 2006 and QDB 2007-2008, the
Quality in Databases (QDB) workshop is a qualified forum for
presenting and discussing novel ideas and solutions related to the
problems of exploring, assessing, monitoring, improving, and
maintaining the quality of data.

Specific topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Data quality dimensions, models and algebra
- Duplicate detection and entity resolution
- Data quality in data integration and fusion
- Quality-aware query languages and query processing techniques
- Data scrubbing, data standardization, data cleaning techniques
- Data quality mining, data preparation and anomaly detection
- Data quality in multi-database or extra-large database settings
- Role of metadata and lineage in data quality evaluation
- Quality of information on the Web
- Quality of scientific, geographical, multimedia or stream data
- Privacy-preserving data quality management
- Data quality tools and benchmarks

--------------------------
IMPORTANT DATES
--------------------------
- Deadline for submissions: June 2, 2009 (5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time)
- Notification of acceptance: July 21, 2009
- Camera-ready versions: August 4, 2009
- Workshop: August 24, 2009

-------------------------------------------
FORMAT AND PAPER SUBMISSION
-------------------------------------------
The main aim of the workshop is to offer participants a venue for
stimulating discussions and comparison of methods and approaches.
In line with this open intent, in addition to previously unpublished
material the program committee welcomes paper submissions that
include ideas and material that may have appeared elsewhere, insofar
as they are judged to be a sound and valuable contribution to the
discussion. For the seventh edition of the workshop, we would like
to promote the presentations of research-in-progress papers and
posters. We propose three categories for submission:
- research papers (should not exceed 10 pages)
- short papers (up to 6 pages)
- posters (up to 3 pages).

The required format templates are available in Word and LaTeX at:
http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions .
Papers should be to be submitted in PDF via CMT:
https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/qdb2009/ .

Best papers may be recommended for fast-tracking to the ACM Journal
of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ).
