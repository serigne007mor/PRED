Description:

Transition to agroecology is quite often seen as a shift to more=20
knowledge-intensive farming practices and to enlarge management issues=20
from farm to territory. Are ICT aiming at gathering, sharing, ordering=20
or even creating information and knowledge an efficient resource to help=20
on agroecology transition of agriculture?

Agroecological transition of agriculture requires implementing new=20
farming practices (from low-diversity- to high-diversity-based),=20
developing new local social networks either for farmers community to=20
share knowledge and experience or selling agricultural products (local=20
markets). Participatory approaches are particularly well suited to=20
support stakeholders in designing and implementing this transition. ICT=20
may facilitate the construction of a agroecological transition at local=20
level:

- Store and record information: exchanges and discussions during=20
workshops allowing traceability of exchanges and choices, information=20
and data used during the workshops; thematic maps (eg farming systems=20
and environmental issues within the territory), directory of innovative=20
farmers, discussion forums or territory slides; how to store design=20
elements proposed by actors with respect of their possible conflictual=20
views on the knowledge and on the territory,
- Show and visualize data: present and future vision of the territory,=20
interactively views of the content of knowledge bases, visualization of=20
the dynamics and exchange networks at workshops, modeling choices,=20
system analysis dashboards, innovative visualization tools such as 3D=20
telescope to have the feeling of being on the ground...
- Structure and equip participatory processes: access to participatory=20
methods, toolkits to facilitate discussions during participative=20
workshops for modeling and scripting (repositories, intermediate=20
objects, potential physical exchanges between players, tools=20
diagnostics, agricultural or regional projects, computer graphics=20
simulations, method of socio-economic scenarios of changes), educational=20
materials, modalities and achievements of a participatory workshop,=20
serious games based on low- and high-diversity based agroecologisation,=20
virtual meetings, etc.
- Share and spread knowledge: internally at workshops or broader,=20
synchronously or asynchronously, direct exchanges between innovators,=20
popularize the results of observatories
- Create new knowledge: from mixing the diverse information sources,=20
experimental knowledge, scientific knowledge, knowledge from farmers, we=20
explore how participatory methods can be used 1) with knowledge=20
formalization techniques (ontologies, unified modelling language, etc.)=20
or 2) with semi-formal techniques (multi-viewpoints knowledge=20
organisation systems, social semantic web, federated Wiki)

The workshop aims at debating the technical possibilities and how they=20
are used by researchers and stakeholders during participatory meetings.
Depending on the number of papers, we will focus on a set of original=20
proposals followed by subthemes discussion. A general discussion will=20
aim at drawing innovative points of view.
