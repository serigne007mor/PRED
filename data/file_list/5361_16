*International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence & Edge Computing=20
(AIEC 2021)*

https://sites.google.com/view/waiec2021/
<https://sites.google.com/view/waiec2021/>

in conjunction with

*The Sixth International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing=20
(FMEC 2021)*

Gandia, Spain. December 6-9, 2021 (virtual)

*AIEC 2021 CFP*

Artificial Intelligence (AI) became a popular wide area for the latest-=20
generation of software-oriented solutions. Lately, AI has been=20
considered as a hot topic due to its huge applications and it attracted=20
attention from academia as well as industrial and end users while=20
receiving positive media coverage. AI is advancing at considerable speed=20
and lead to many widely beneficial applications, variant from Machine=20
Translation to Medical Image Computing. From R&D perspectives, AI=20
acquires incredible amounts of progress in terms funding investors=20
devoted on AI applications.

According to AI efforts, Edge Computing (EC) has become an essential=20
solution to overcome the strangulation of emerging technology=20
development according to its benefits of minimizing data transmission,=20
reducing service latency and easing cloud computing pressure. Also, the=20
scope of EC is very diverse on large application area, such as smart=20
grid and smart city, logistics and transportation, manufacturing and=20
healthcare. Furthermore, the EC provide significant gains which include=20
low-latency thus allowing close cooperation in sophisticated mobile=20
applications and on the core network to reduce traffic volume as data=20
streaming along the way to the distant data center is no longer=20
necessary. The evolution of new technologies of communication such as 5G=20
made communication so much easier where the latency is lower and memory=20
bandwidth is higher, the border between edge infrastructure and mobile=20
devices will be even imprecise and EC will become more attractive.

The Workshop on Artificial Intelligence & Edge Computing (AIEC) aims to=20
bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and=20
industry who are working on Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing=20
as well as their integration, to exchange research ideas and identify=20
new research challenges in this emerging field.

*Topics*

The Workshop on Artificial Intelligence & Edge Computing (AIEC) calls=20
for contributions that address fundamental research and solutions issues=20
in Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing including but not limited=20
to the following :

=E2=80=A2Applications/services for Edge AI

=E2=80=A2Communication and Networking Protocols for Edge AI

=E2=80=A2Software Platforms for Edge

*Important Dates *

=E2=80=A2*Submission Date: 17^th October, 2021*

=E2=80=A2Notification to Authors: *1^st November, 2021*

=E2=80=A2Camera Ready Submission: *10^th November, 2021*

*Submissions Guidelines and Proceedings *

Papers selected for presentation will appear in the FMEC Proceedings,=20
which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society and be submitted to=20
IEEE Xplore for inclusion. Papers must be 6 pages in IEEE format, 10pt=20
font using the IEEE 8.5" x 11" two-column format, single space, A4=20
format. All papers should be in PDF format, and submitted electronically=20
at Paper Submission Link. A full paper must not exceed the stated length=20
(including all figures, tables and references). Submitted papers must=20
present original unpublished research that is not currently under review=20
for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these=20
guidelines may be rejected without review. Also submissions received=20
after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately=20
structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the Program=20
Chair for further information or clarification.

<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwaiec2021> *

*Journal Special Issues *

Selected papers from the will be invited to submit an extended version=20
to the following journal. Papers will be selected based on their=20
reviewers=E2=80=99 scores and appropriateness to the Journal=E2=80=99s th=
eme. All=20
extended versions will undergo reviews and must represent original=20
unpublished research work. Further details will be made available at a=20
