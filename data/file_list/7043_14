CALL FOR PAPERS

19th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATABASE THEORY (ICDT 2016)=20

Bordeaux, France, March 15-18, 2016



The series of ICDT conferences provides an international forum for the
communication of research advances on the theoretical foundations of
database systems. Originally biennial, the ICDT conference has been
held annually and jointly with EDBT (Extending Database Technology)
since 2009.

The 19th edition of ICDT will take place in Bordeaux, France, from
March 15th to 18th, 2016. For ICDT 2016 we again call for original
research papers that provide new insights in the theoretical
foundations of database systems.

Topics of interest for submissions include, but are not limited to:
Business processes and workflows;=20
Complexity and performance;
Concurrency and recovery;=20
Data exchange and data integration;=20
Data mining;=20
Data models, semantics, and query languages;=20
Data privacy and security;=20
Data provenance;=20
Data streams;=20
Inconsistency and uncertainty
in databases;=20
Information extraction;=20
Deductive databases;=20
Distributed and parallel databases;=20
Logic and databases;=20
Ontology-based query answering;=20
Query processing and optimization;=20
Semi-structured data, graph databases and (Semantic) Web data;=20
Spatial and temporal databases;=20
Transaction management;=20
Views and data warehousing.

Conference                    :  March 15-18, 2016


Submission instructions

Papers must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the
program committee to assess their merits. They should begin with a
succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a
brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the
conference, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development
directed to the specialist should follow. References and comparisons
with related work should be included. The results must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings
of other symposia or workshops.=20

Papers must be submitted as PDF documents no longer than 15 pages
excluding references, using the LIPIcs style
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors <ht=
tp://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors>).
Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix which,
however, will be read at the discretion of the program
committee. Papers not conforming to these requirements may be rejected
without further consideration.

The proceedings will appear in the in the Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl.
This guarantees that the proceedings will be available online and free
of charge, while the authors retain the rights over their work.

One author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the
conference and to present the paper.


Submission Site

All submissions will be electronic via=20
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicdt2016 <https://easychair.org/c=
onferences/?conf=3Dicdt2016>


Review process

The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period during
which authors will have the option to respond to reviewer
comments. Final decision will take this feedback into consideration,
and it will be made two weeks later.


Awards

An award will be given to the best paper. Also, an award will be given
to the best paper written by newcomers to the field of database
theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a paper
written only by students; in that case the award will be called "Best
Student Paper Award". The program committee reserves the following
rights: not to give an award; to split an award among several papers;
and to define the notion of a newcomer. Papers authored or co-authored
by program committee members are not eligible for any award.
