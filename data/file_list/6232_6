Subject: [liste-egc] ESWC 2014 Call for Workshops


** apologies for cross-posting **

=3D=3D=3D=3D Call for Workshops =3D=3D=3D=3D
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-workshops

The organizers of the 11th ESWC 2014 cordially invite you to submit a works=
hop proposal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific re=
sults and innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and =
Linked Data, attracting a high number of high quality submissions and parti=
cipants from academia and industry alike.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points f=
or discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantic technologie=
s and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with =
an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technolog=
y of general interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submi=
ssion of workshop proposals on:
=20=20
Fundamental problems of the Semantic Web / Linked Data such as ontology min=
ing, heterogeneity, scalability and distribution, uncertainty, etc.
Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the Se=
mantic Web, and
Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far,
Techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic We=
b research (e.g., machine learning, NLP, data mining)

General Information and Criteria
Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme com=
mittee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the wor=
kshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will =
determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, =
which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the =
local and the general chair of ESWC 2014.
=20=20
The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:
=20=20
Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC =
conference.
Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-confer=
ences.
We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attrac=
t various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or ap=
plication.
There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's t=
opic.
Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
We strongly advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, pr=
eferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to th=
e workshop topic.
=20=20
In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact =
the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note=
 that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the ove=
rall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less t=
han 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early regis=
tration deadline might be canceled.
=20=20
The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own revi=
ewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers), an=
d proceedings production. They will be required to closely cooperate with t=
he Workshop Chair and the ESWC 2014 local organizers to finalize all organi=
zational details. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop regist=
ration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for work=
shops and tutorials at the pre-conference days, i.e. they will only have to=
 pay the main conference fee.

Submission Guidelines
Workshop proposals have to be submitted via Easychair. Each proposal must c=

, which contains the following information:
=20=20
The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying its g=
oals and motivation.
A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, the wor=
kshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, discus=
sing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, invited =
talks, panels, hacking session, or general discussion, and and an approxima=
te timeline.
A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have t=
o be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day o=
r full-day event.
Related Workshops and Conferences: Is this the continuation of a workshop s=
eries or a new workshop to address an emerging issue? Please provide inform=
ation about past versions of this workshop and other related workshops (inc=
luding URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
Names and contact information of the workshop organizers/chair(s) (name, af=
filiation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) biography of e=
ach chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the workshop including past=
 experience in organizing/facilitating workshops). Preferably a single cont=
act person per submission.

The best papers of each workshop will be included in the supplementary proc=
eedings of ESWC 2014, which will appear in the Springer LNCS series.
