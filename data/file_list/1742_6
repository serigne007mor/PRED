*The Tenth International Conference on Discovery Science*
*Sendai, Japan, 1-4 October 2007*
*Preliminary Call for Papers*
More info at: http://www.i.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~ds07/ 
<http://www.i.kyushu-u.ac.jp/%7Eds07/>

The Tenth International Conference on Discovery Science (DS-2007) will 
be held in Sendai, Japan, on 1-4 October
2007. DS-2007 will be collocated with ALT-2007, the Eighteenth 
International Conference on Algorithmic
Learning Theory. The two conferences will be held in parallel, and will 
share their invited talks. The proceedings of
DS-2007 will appear in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 
Series by Springer-Verlag. DS-2007 provides an
open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among 
researchers working in the area of
Discovery Science. The scope of the conference includes the development 
and analysis of methods for intelligent
data analysis, knowledge discovery and machine learning, as well as 
their application to scientific knowledge
discovery.

*Submissions*
We invite submissions of research papers addressing all aspects of 
discovery science. We particularly welcome
contributions that discuss the application of data analysis and other 
support techniques for scientific discovery
including, but not limited to, biomedical, astronomical and other 
physics domains.
Two types of submissions are solicited: regular and long papers. Regular 
papers will be presented in an oral
spotlight presentation and a poster; authors of long papers will have 
the opportunity to give an extended oral
presentation. Detailed instructions for submission will be available on 
the conference website soon. A paper
submission must be formatted according to the layout supplied by 
Springer-Verlag for the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series. Regular papers must not exceed five (5) pages, 
whereas long papers may contain up to
twelve (12) pages.

*Mentoring Program and Student Award*
Based on the success of the passed two years, DS-2007 is featuring once 
again a mentoring program. Students who
are first authors of papers are invited to submit a paper draft no later 
than the mentoring deadline. They will receive
comments from a PC member that will help them prepare their final 
submission. An excellent student paper will be
selected to receive the Carl Smith Award. The award carries a 
scholarship prize of 555 Euros.

*Submission Topics*
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

    . Logic and philosophy of scientific discovery,
    . Knowledge discovery, machine learning and statistical methods,
    . Active knowledge discovery,
    . Text and web mining,
    . Information extraction from scientific literature,
    . Knowledge discovery from text and the web,
    . Knowledge discovery from unstructured and multimedia data,
    . Knowledge discovery in network and link data,
    . Knowledge discovery in social networks,
    . Data and knowledge visualization,
    . Data Streams,
    . Spatial/Temporal Data,
    . Human-machine interaction for knowledge discovery and management,
    . Biomedical knowledge discovery, analysis of microarray and gene
    deletion data,
    . Applications of the above techniques to natural or social sciences,
    . Other applications of the above techniques.
