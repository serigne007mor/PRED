[Apologies for potential double postings]=20




The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis 2024 will take place April 24-26=
, 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden .=20




Authors are welcome to submit original contributions on the topic of intell=
igent data analysis. IDA=E2=80=99s mission is to promote ideas over perform=
ance. Thus, while each contribution should contain some theoretical or empi=
rical evaluation, exhaustive evaluation is not required as long as a convin=
cing and solid motivation is given.=20

Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process (author identities a=
re known to reviewers). The conventional reviewing process, which favors in=
cremental advances on established work, can discourage the kinds of papers =
that IDA 2024 aims to publish. The reviewing process will address this issu=
e explicitly: referees will evaluate papers on the basis of novelty, techni=
cal quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission wi=
ll be reviewed by one of the senior program committee members. Any paper fo=
r which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the sympo=
sium=E2=80=99s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review sco=
re.=20

All accepted paper contributions will be published in the Lecture Notes in =
Computer Science series by Springer-Verlag.=20




Formatting instructions=20

Contributions, written in English, must be formatted according to the guide=
lines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Ve=
rlag, which are available together with templates here: [ https://www.sprin=

//www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelin=
es ] . We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page li=
mit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and a=
ppendices, is 10-12 pages in LNCS format. Submission of the camera-ready ve=
rsion of the paper has to include the authors=E2=80=99 consent to publish o=
n the above Springer LNCS website.=20

Authors may not submit any paper which is under review elsewhere or which h=
as been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neithe=
r will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of IDA 2=
024.=20




Submission=20

Papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF format. The submission inte=
rface will open later.=20

Paper submission deadline: November 17, November 24, 2023=20
