*
5th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics

WIMS 2015

July 13-15, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/wims2015/

*** Extended Submission Deadline: 7th April 2015 ***


_Conference Purpose and Scope
_
WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science
conferences. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present 
their
state-of-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine performance
characteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent information
technology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of Web
-based intelligent information management solutions across different
domains.

The purpose of the WIMS series is to:

* Provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to present
their contributions to the state of the art research and development in Web
technology and applications.

* Give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research to a 
friendly
and knowledgeable audience and receive valuable feedback.

* Provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and
practitioners can meet.

WIMS traditionally hosts a small number of short tutorials on the topics
related to the scope of the conference series. The role of a WIMS 
tutorial is to
be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey. The call for WIMS 2015 tutorials
is published separately.

WIMS also offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of 
satellite
workshops that complement the scope of the conference. The call for WIMS
2015 workshops is also published separately.

Companies or individuals interested in presenting their industrial 
products or
methodologies are invited to contact the conference chairs.

_Submission Guidelines

_Four types of submissions are solicited for the main conference:
i. Regular research papers
ii. Short research papers
iii. Case Studies and Applications papers
iv. Posters

The papers in all the categories should describe original results that 
have not
been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions 
will be
evaluated by at least three members of the international program committee.

_Regular Research Papers
_
The papers in this category are the reports on accomplished research work or
in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem. The first type of
papers can present a novel method, technique or analysis with appropriate
empirical or other type of evaluation as a proof of validity. The main
evaluation criteria for this category are originality, technical 
soundness, and
the soundness of evaluation. For the second type within the genre we expect
receiving reasonable overviews placing a problem onto the state-of-the-art
landscape and analyzing how far current solutions fall short. We also expect
in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem, with clear 
definitions
and argumentation in terms of qualitative or quantitative representation of
the main characteristics of the problem.

Page limit: 12 ACM pages


_Short Research Papers
_
The papers in this category are the short reports of the preliminary 
results or
describing the work in progress. The main evaluation criteria for this 
category
are originality, technical correctness, and possible value of the planned
results in a short to mid-term perspective.

Short papers can be also presented in a form of a poster.

Page limit: 6 ACM pages

_Case Studies and Applications Papers
_
The papers in this category describe case studies of deployed applications,
lessons learnt, and examples of measurable benefits. This category also
includes papers that reports innovative applications of WIMS in areas of
industry and government, as well as industrial experience and
demonstrations of innovative systems.

Page limit: 12 ACM pages

_Posters_

WIMS poster track is a venue for late-breaking results, ongoing research
activities, and speculative or innovative work in progress. This track is
intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect 
with
each other and to engage in discussions about the work. Posters provide
authors with a unique opportunity to draw attention to their work during the
conference.

Page limit: 4 ACM pages

Submissions should be made electronically in PDF or DOC/DOCX (MS/Open
Word) format via the electronic submission system of the WIMS2015
Conference Management system at:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wims15

_Publication_

Accepted papers/tutorials/posters will be published by ACM and
disseminated through the ACM Digital Library through the International
Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS).

_Important Dates_

                <u>Submission Guidelines<br>
                  <br>
                </u>Four types of submissions are solicited for the main
                conference:<br>
                i. Regular research papers<br>
                ii. Short research papers<br>
                iii. Case Studies and Applications papers<br>
                iv. Posters<br>
                <br>
                The papers in all the categories should describe
                original results that have not<br>
                been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere.
                All submissions will be<br>
                evaluated by at least three members of the international
                program committee.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Regular Research Papers<br>
                </u><br>
                The papers in this category are the reports on
                accomplished research work or<br>
                in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem.
                The first type of<br>
                papers can present a novel method, technique or analysis
                with appropriate<br>
                empirical or other type of evaluation as a proof of
                validity. The main<br>
                evaluation criteria for this category are originality,
                technical soundness, and<br>
                the soundness of evaluation. For the second type within
                the genre we expect<br>
                receiving reasonable overviews placing a problem onto
                the state-of-the-art<br>
                landscape and analyzing how far current solutions fall
                short. We also expect<br>
                in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem,
                with clear definitions<br>
                and argumentation in terms of qualitative or
                quantitative representation of<br>
                the main characteristics of the problem.<br>

                <u>Short Research Papers<br>
                </u><br>
                The papers in this category are the short reports of the
                preliminary results or<br>
                describing the work in progress. The main evaluation
                criteria for this category<br>
                are originality, technical correctness, and possible
                value of the planned<br>
                results in a short to mid-term perspective. <br>
                <br>
                Short papers can be also presented in a form of a
                poster.<br>

                <u>Case Studies and Applications Papers<br>
                </u><br>
                The papers in this category describe case studies of
                deployed applications,<br>
                lessons learnt, and examples of measurable benefits.
                This category also<br>
                includes papers that reports innovative applications of
                WIMS in areas of<br>
                industry and government, as well as industrial
                experience and<br>
