--- FOCUS ---

The traditional focus of the IDA symposium series is on end-to-end intelligent
support for data analysis. In 2010, the series re-focused to support papers
that go beyond established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-
changing" ideas, whilst not always being as fully realized as papers submitted
to other conferences.

IDA 2014 continues this approach and explicitly seeks "first look" papers that
might elsewhere be considered preliminary but contain potentially high impact
research. To emphasize this, IDA 2014 will include a new track -- see below for
the details. The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to ERA, is open to
all kinds of modeling and analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is
expected to be an interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that cut
across domains.

--- FRONTIER PRIZE ---

The IDA Frontier Prize will be awarded to the most visionary contribution.
Submissions considered for this award must present novel and surprising
approaches to data analysis. Last years' winners can be found on the IDA 2014
website. The award consists of a plaque and a prize of 1000 euros.

--- KEYNOTE SPEAKERS ---

Along with the regular presentations, the symposium schedule will feature
three exciting keynote talks by renowned researchers:

- Chris Lintott (University of Oxford)
	"Lessons from the crowd: Citizen Science and Big Data"

- Arnoldo Frigessi (University of Oslo)
	"Bayesian Inference for Ranks"

- Jan Van den Bussche (Universiteit Hasselt)
	"The DNA query language DNAQL"

--- CALL FOR PAPERS ---

IDA solicits papers on all aspects of intelligent data analysis, including
papers on intelligent techniques to modeling and analyzing data from complex,
dynamical systems. IDA 2014 particularly encourages papers about:

   - Novel applications of IDA techniques to complex systems
   - Novel modes of data acquisition and integration
   - Novel approaches that demonstrate how users can add to the analysis process
   - Robustness and scalability issues of intelligent data analysis techniques
   - Visualization and dissemination of results

Intelligent support for data analysis goes beyond the usual algorithmic
offerings in the literature. Papers about established technology should offer
novel ways to analyzing and/or modeling complex systems to get accepted. The
conventional reviewing process has a tendency to favor incremental but solid
contributions over novel but exploratory ones. This can discourage the kind of
papers that IDA hopes to publish. For this reason, IDA 2014 will have two paper
tracks, both of which address this issue:

A] Proceedings Track

This is the regular IDA paper track, which will be continued unchanged.
Submitted papers will be reviewed and, if accepted, published in the
proceedings. Submitted papers should consist of at most 11 pages in LNCS format.
Papers may be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.

To ensure that the papers sought by IDA get accepted, referees will evaluate
papers against the stated goals of the symposium, and if at least one program
chair advisor writes an informed, thoughtful, positive review for a paper, this
may outweigh the criticism of other reviewers.

Following IDA's tradition, the proceedings of IDA 2014 will be published as a
volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

B] First Look Track

New this year is the First Look Track, which allows you to present your
groundbreaking research at the symposium if it is not yet mature enough for
the Proceedings Track. You may have a great idea that needs to be investigated
in more detail, or you may have a long-term vision that you would like to share.
In these cases, it may be impossible or undesirable to publish a preliminary
version of your paper in the proceedings, but presenting and discussing it at
IDA may be of interest to both you and the community.

For the First Look Track we solicit short papers, up to 8 pages in LNCS format,
that will be reviewed in a setup similar to that of the Proceedings Track. Also,
submissions can be accepted for either oral or poster presentation, but they
will not be published in the proceedings. Note that only a limited number of
papers can be accepted for this track; if your paper is ready for publication
we recommend submitting to the regular Proceedings Track.

Note that papers accepted to both tracks are eligible to win the Frontier Prize.
