botic Things (IoRT) domain in general, and data-centric IoRT applications i=
n particular. IoRT systems offer significant advances and benefits in many =
aspects of human life. They have emerged as central enabling technology in =
a wide range of applications and domains, including agriculture, manufactur=
ing, industry, smart-home, and health. However, the design, implementation,=
 and operation of IoRT systems are challenging due to the need to collect, =
manage, and analyze possibly large amounts of complex, heterogeneous data. =
Techniques and tools from model-based engineering and conceptual modeling m=

 to the IoRT domain.=20
This theme section aims to be a point of contact for practitioners and rese=
