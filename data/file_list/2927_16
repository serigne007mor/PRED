%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
CONTEXT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

THE REGIONAL PROJECT:=C2=A0 DOING project aims to develop methods and too=
ls=20
to first extract information from textual data by structuring it in a=20
database graph, and then to manipulate this knowledge graph in an=20
intelligent way. The envisaged application domain is the health domain,=20
primarily using freely available data (such as clinical cases). DOING=20
aims to design a new form of declarative queries, which can integrate=20
analyses, that will guide health specialists in their decision-making.

DOING (https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/doing/) is based on a=20
real interdisciplinary collaboration to transform data into information=20
and then into knowledge.

This is a project in the context of DOING@MADICS action and DOING@DIAMS=20
working group.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SUBJECT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The postdoctoral research work concerns Task 2 of the DOING (APR-IA)=20
project.

The goal is the development of a first version of a query system on=20
graph databases, whose (declarative) query language would encompass=20
predictive analysis - a term that combines data management, machine=20
learning and optimisation, and which reflects the growing demand for=20
such tools for handling data science problems. The task consists of the=20
following steps:


(1) Modelling a query language on a graph database for the application=20
of a graph node classification method.=C2=A0=C2=A0 There are many applica=
tions in=20
the health domain where the question is to predict the labels of the=20
nodes of a graph (starting with only a fraction of the labelled nodes).=20
For example, predicting whether a patient should be screened for cancer,=20
based on his or her health record, and the similarity of his or her case=20
to other patients. Solutions for node classification using unsupervised=20
methods or convolutional networks exist. The aim is to evaluate their=20
use in the context of databases where only a portion of the graph is=20
available at a time. In particular, we wish to study the problem of=20
prediction by node classification via deep learning techniques. We wish=20
to propose an adaptation of these methods for integration into the=20
Cypher language (Neo4J DBMS).

(2) Method for the construction of query execution plans and study of=20
possible optimisations. The aim here is to prepare the data science=20
pipeline necessary for the preparation of data and the application of=20
learning methods by integrating constraints.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
COLLABORATION TEAM
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The postdoctoral proposal is done in the context of a collaborative work=20
which involves the following researchers:

At LIFO:
(1) Jacques Chabin <jacques.chabin@univ-orleans.fr>
(2) Mirian Halfeld Ferrari <mirian@univ-orleans.fr>

At LIFAT
(1) Donatello Conte <donatello.conte@univ-tours.fr>
(2) Jean-Yves Ramel <jean-yves.ramel@univ-tours.fr>

At LIRIS
Genoveva Vargas Solar <genoveva.vargas-solar@univ-lyon1.fr>

The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to interact to all the=20
group.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
CANDIDATE PROFILE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The candidate should have a PhD degree in computer science. The work=20
involves knowledge in the domain of databases and of machine learning.=20
Skills on at least ONE of these areas are required. The candidate should=20
also be motivated to invest in the complementary field.=C2=A0 A good Engl=
ish=20
level is also required.

French is not mandatory for candidates with a very good level of English=20
and willing to learn=C2=A0 French for daily life in France.

The research work is conducted at=C2=A0 the Laboratoire d'Informatique=20
Fondamentale d'Orl=C3=A9ans (LIFO), in France. The postdoctoral fellow sh=
ould=20
be physically present (i.e., the Postdoctoral position is not achievable=20
by remote work).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TO APPLY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Send your applications by email (mentionning [postdocDOING] in the=20
subject) to the=C2=A0 following addresses:
(1) mirian@univ-orleans.fr
(2) donatello.conte@univ-tours.fr


The application should contain:
+=C2=A0 a detailed curriculum vitae (with your email),
