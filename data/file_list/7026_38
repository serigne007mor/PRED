	    Track on WEB COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS (WeCA)

               The 11th IEEE International Conference on
         SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS (SITIS 15)
                   Bangkok, Thailand, 23-27, November 2015
			http://www.sitis-conf.org/

                In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP French Chapter

The WeCA (Web Computing and Application) track will focus on emerging and n=
ovel concepts,
architectures and methodologies for information management. The Internet an=
d the related
technologies have created an interconnected world in which information can =
be exchanged easily,
tasks can be processed collaboratively, communities of users with similarly=
 interests
can be formed to achieve efficiency and improve performance.

Taking full advantage of these interconnected environments to meet the ever=
 increasing
needs of emerging application requires solutions that address new issues an=
d challenges.
Novel architectures are being proposed to allow resource sharing and distri=
buted processing
of linked data and devices. Peer to peer computing, mobile information syst=
ems, semantic
based applications, linked data systems, Internet of things etc. are a few =
examples.

Topics of interest include, but not limited, to:
----------------------------------------------

* Data semantics
* Web-Centric Systems
* Semantic Web
* Social media and networking
* Big Data
* Information System Interoperability
* Digital Libraries
* Cloud Computing
* Integrated, Virtualized and Distributed Information Systems
* Multimedia and application
* Information security
* Service Based Systems


Submission and publication
--------------------------
SITIS'15 WeCa Track invites submission of high quality and original papers
on the topics listed above.
Allsubmitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for
technical merit, originality, significance and relevance to track topics.

Papers must be up to 8 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication for=
mat.

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published
by IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major indexes.

Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for potential publicat=
ion
journals.



Important dates
---------------
* Paper Submission: September 7, 2015
* Acceptance/Reject notification: October 7, 2015
* Camera ready: October 15, 2015
* Author registration: October 19, 2015
