XXII Brazilian Symposium on Databases
SBBD 2007

João Pessoa, Paraiba – Brazil
October 15-19, 2007

http://www.sbbd-sbes2007.ufpb.br/

PRELIMINARY CALL FOR TUTORIALS

***************************************************
* Important Dates
***************************************************

Tutorial submission: June 1, 2007
Notification of acceptance: July 9, 2007
Abstracts for proceedings: July 31, 2007

****************************************************
* Overview
****************************************************

Promoted by SBC, Brazilian Computer, SBBD is the official event of SBC 
(Sociedade Brasileira de Computação/Brazilian Computer
Society) in the database area and the largest venue in Latin America for 
presentation and discussion of research results in the database
domain. It gathers researchers, students and practitioners, from Brazil 
and abroad, for discussing problems related to the main topics
in this domain. Besides technical sessions and tutorials, the symposium 
also includes invited talks given by distinguished speakers from
the international research community.

In past editions, SBBD has been organized in cooperation with ACM/SIGMOD 
and partially sponsored by the VLDB Endownment.
In its 22nd edition, the symposium will be held in the beautiful city of 
João Pessoa, located in the pleasant northeast shore of Brazil, in
October 15-17. Following the trend of recent past editions, SBBD is 
expected to gather about 1000 attendees in the 2007 edition.

SBBD 2007 invites submissions of tutorial proposals. Each tutorial will 
be presented in a 3 hours session. Only an abstract (1-2 pages)
of the accepted tutorials, including bibliographic references will be 
published in the symposium proceedings. However, copies of the
presentation slides will be also required for distribution at the 
symposium to the tutorial attendees.

We will consider proposals for introductory and advanced tutorials on 
any topic within the area of databases. Introductory tutorials
should target an audience consisting of advanced undergraduate and 
graduate students, as well as attendees from industry.
Hence, they can be thought of as "recycling" courses though they should 
not be about traditional "textbook" topics.
Advanced tutorials, on the other hand, must cover a topic's 
state-of-the-art, motivating and exposing potential research issues.


*********************************************************
* Instructions for Authors
*********************************************************
All proposals are to be emailed as plain text file or PDF attachments to:

tutorialssbbd2007@gmail.co

and must include only the following items (in this order):

* Tutorial title, authors' name, affiliations, e-mails and URL of the 
respective home pages (if available).
* Type (introductory or advanced), language to be presented (English or 
Portuguese) and a short (10-15 lines) abstract stating its main goal.
* Outline of the tutorial, including its main components, each one being 
described using 10-15 lines.
* A timeline of the tutorial presentation should also be included.
* List of (up to 10) related references.
* Where this tutorial has been presented before (or is under 
consideration for presentation), if applicable.
* A short biographical skecth of each author (10-20 lines/author).
* Audio-visual equipment required (e.g. overhead or multimedia projector)

************************************************************

Depending on funding availability, SBBD 2007 may be able to cover travel 
and lodging expenses for one presenter per accepted tutorial.
In case of a tutorial proposed by more than one researcher the decision 
of who would actually present the tutorial must be discussed with
the tutorial chair. The presenting author will be required to register 
him/herself for the symposium. SBBD reserves the right to refuse all
of the submitted tutorial proposals, as well as to include invited 
tutorial presentations.
