===== ===== =====

** Beyond Facts **
* 1st International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse 
(KnOD) *

- Collocated with ESWC 2020 - the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2020
- May 31 – June 4, Heraklion (Crete, Greece)


https://knod2020.wordpress.com/ [1]


*Summary*

Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to
the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims
and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts
(events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights
for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo
chambers or political agenda setting.  While knowledge graphs (KGs)
promise to provide the key to a Web of structured information, they are
mainly focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity,
connection or temporal evolution of online discourse data. As opposed to
facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly
depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended
meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly
diverge across communities from computational social science, to
argumentation mining, fact-checking, or viewpoint/stance detection.

This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these
communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling,
extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the
need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse
data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and
reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the
analysis of societal debates on the Web.

* Topics of interest*

- Ontologies and data models for online discourse data
- Reuse and extension of existing models such as schema.org [2] and 
Wikidata
- KGs and knowledge extraction techniques in the context of online 
discourse
- Computational fact-checking / truth discovery
- Bias and controversy detection and analysis
- Stance and viewpoint discovery
- Rumour, propaganda and hate-speech detection
- Integration, aggregation, linking and enrichment of discourse data
- Semantic and exploratory search of online discourse data
- Argumentation and reasoning over online discourse
- Recommender systems for discourse data
- Quality, uncertainty, provenance, and trust of discourse data
- Benchmarks and training data for extraction, verification or linkingof 
discourse data
- Use-cases, applications and cross-community interfaces

* Submission *

- Full papers (up to 14 pages LNCS style): original research of 
relevance to the workshop topics
- Short papers (up to 6 pages): research in progress of relevance to the 
workshop topics
- Posters (up to 4 pages): vision & position statements or work in 
progress
- Demo and system papers (up to 4 pages): descriptions of prototypes, 
demos or systems

* Important Dates *

- Papers due: February 28, 2020
- Paper notifications: March 27, 2020
- Paper camera-ready versions due: April 10, 2020
- Workshop: May 31, 2020
