Subject: [liste-egc] CFP META'2021 @Marrakech


Dear colleagues,
please distribute the CFP of META Conf. in your networks. Thanks for 
your collaboration.

Apologies for cross-posting. Appreciate if you can distribute this CFP 
to your network.

**********************************************************************
                                                       META'2021
International Conference on Metaheuristics and Nature Inspired Computing
                                                    27-30 Oct 2021
                                            Marrakech, Morocco
http://meta2021.sciencesconf.org/
**********************************************************************

META is one of the main event focusing on the progress of the area of 
metaheuristics and their applications. As in previous editions, 
META’2021 will provide an opportunity to the international research 
community in metaheuristics to discuss recent research results, to 
develop new ideas and collaborations, and to meet old friends and make 
new ones in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.

All selected long papers will be published in the Springer (SCOPUS, ISI, 
DBLP) conference proceedings.
At least, 2 special special issues in ISI and SCOPUS journals are also 
confirmed.

META'2021 welcomes presentations that cover any aspects of metaheuristic 
research such as new algorithmic developments, high-impact applications, 
new research challenges, theoretical developments, implementation 
issues, and in-depth experimental studies. META'2021 strives for a 
high-quality program that will be completed by a number of invited 
talks, tutorials, workshops and special sessions.

The scope of the META conference includes, but is not limited to:
     * Local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, VNS, ILS, …
     * Evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, bio-inspired 
algorithms, …
     * Emergent nature inspired algorithms: quantum computing, 
artificial immune systems, bee colony, DNA computing, …
     * Quantum computing
     * Parallel and distributed algorithms
     * Decomposition methods
     * Hybrid methods with machine learning, game theory, mathematical 
programming, constraint programming, co-evolutionary, …
     * Application to: logistics and transportation, networks, 
scheduling, data mining, engineering design, energy, cloud, bio-medical, …
     * Theory of metaheuristics, landscape analysis, convergence, 
problem difficulty, very large neighbourhoods, …
     * Multi-objective optimization, bi-level optimization
     * Dynamic optimization, problems with uncertainty, stochastic 
optimization, …
     * Parameter tuning (static, dynamic, adaptive, self-adaptive)
     * Hyper-heuristics, cross-domain metaheuristics
     * Software frameworks for metaheuristics and nature inspired computing


Submission of papers:
____________________

- Submission of papers via the website

     S1) Short papers: Extended abstracts of work-in-progress and 
position papers of a maximum of 3 pages.
     S2) Long papers: Original research contributions of a maximum of 10 
pages.

within the last year, been submitted or accepted for journal 
publication. For this special case, the submission should have the same 
title that the accepted work, the abstract AND the complete reference of 
the work.

- Proceedings of the conference will be provided. Selected papers of 
type S2 will be published in a Springer book (SCOPUS, ISI, DBLP).
- Predefined styles are available on the website 
http://meta2021.sciencesconf.org/
