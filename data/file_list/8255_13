Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence
 (KDBI - EPIA2013)

We would be very grateful if you could disseminate this call among your 
research peers and colleagues.

Please excuse us if you receive this email more than once.

Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence (KDBI - EPIA2013) thematic 
track
of the 16th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence  (EPIA 2013)
Angra do Heroísmo, Açores, Portugal, 2013. Web-page: 
http://www.epia2013.uac.pt/
>> Deadline for paper submission: 15th March, 2013 <<
>> Best papers in Special Issue in Journal Expert Systems (indexed at ISI) <<

Nowadays, business organizations are increasingly moving towards 
decision-making processes that are based on information. In parallel, 
the amount of data representing the activities of organizations that is 
stored in databases is also exponentially growing. Thus, the pressure to 
extract as much useful information as possible from these data is very 
strong. Knowledge Discovery (KD) is a branch of the Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) field that aims to extract useful and understandable 
high-level knowledge from complex and/or large volumes of data. On the 
other hand, Business Intelligence (BI) is an umbrella term that 
represents computer architectures, tools, technologies and methods to 
enhance managerial decision making in public and corporate enterprises, 
from operational to strategic level.

KD and BI are faced with new challenges. For example, due to the 
Internet expansion, huge amounts of data are available through the Web. 
Moreover, objects of analysis exist in time and space, often under 
dynamic and unstable environments, evolving incrementally over time. 
Another KD challenge is the integration of background knowledge (e.g. 
cognitive models or inductive logic) into the learning process. In 
addition, AI plays a crucial role in BI, providing methodologies to deal 
with prediction, optimization and adaptability to dynamic environments, 
in an attempt to offer support to better (more informed) decisions. In 
effect, several AI techniques can be used to address these problems, 
namely KD/Data Mining, Evolutionary Computation and Modern Optimization, 
Forecasting, Neural Computing and Intelligent Agents. Hence, the aim of 
this track is to gather the latest research in KD and BI. In particular, 
papers that describe experience and lessons learned from KD/BI projects 
and/o
r present business and organizational impacts using AI technologies, are 
welcome. Finally, we encourage papers that deal with the interaction 
with the end users, taking into its impact on real organizations.

Topics of interest
A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest is defined as follows:

Knowledge Discovery (KD):
- Data Pre-Processing
- Intelligent Data Analysis
- Temporal and Spatial KD
- Data and Knowledge Visualization
- Machine Learning (e.g. Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Bayesian 
Learning, Inductive and Fuzzy Logic) and Statistical Methods
- Hybrid Learning Models and Methods: Using KD methods and Cognitive 
Models, Neuro-Symbolic Systems, etc.
- Domain KD: Learning from Heterogeneous, Unstructured (e.g. text) and 
Multimedia data, Networks, Graphs and Link Analysis
- Data Mining: Classification, Regression, Clustering and Association Rules
- Ubiquitous Data Mining: Distributed Data Mining, Incremental Learning, 
Change Detection, Learning from Ubiquitous Data Streams

Business Intelligence (BI)/ Data Science:
- Methodologies, Architectures or Computational Tools
- Artificial Intelligence (e.g. KD, Evolutionary Computation, 
Intelligent Agents, Logic) applied to BI: Data Warehouse, OLAP, Data 
Mining, Decision Support Systems, Adaptive BI,Web Intelligence and 
Competitive Intelligence.

Real-world Applications
- Prediction/Optimization in Finance, Marketing, Medicine, Sales, Production
- Mining Big Data and Cloud computing


Paper submission

All papers should be submitted in PDF format through EPIA’2013 
submission Website (select “Knowledge Discovery and Business 
Intelligence” track):
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=epia2013
Submissions must be original and can be of two types: regular 
(full-length) papers should not exceed twelve (12) pages in length, 
whereas short papers should not exceed six (6) pages.
Each submission will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the 
Programme Committee. The reviewing process is double blind, so authors 
should remove names and affiliations from the submitted papers, and must 
take reasonable care to assure anonymity during the review process. 
References to own work may be included in the paper, as long as referred 
to in the third person.

Papers should strictly adhere to formatting instructions of the 
conference: http://www.epia2013.uac.pt/?page_id=564
The best accepted papers will appear in the proceedings published by 
Springer in the LNAI series (EPIA 2011 proceedings were indexed by the 
Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, DBLP and ACM digital library). The 
remaining accepted papers will be published in the local proceedings 
with ISBN.
Special Issue in Journal Expert Systems
Authors of the best papers presented at the KDBI 2013 track of EPIA will 
be invited to submit extended versions of their manuscripts for a 
special issue KDBI of the 'The Wiley-Blackwell Journal Expert Systems: 
The Journal of Knowledge Engineering', indexed at ISI Web of Knowledge 
(ISI impact factor JCR2011 of 0.684, JCR2010 of 1.231): 
http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117963144/home

Deadlines:
- Paper submission: March 15, 2013
- Acceptance notification: April 30, 2013
- Camera-ready papers: May 31, 2013
- Venue: September, 9 to 13, 2013
