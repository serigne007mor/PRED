************************************************************************************************************************************************************


In contrast to traditional database applications, the process of 
building Business Intelligence (BI) applications is complex, expensive, 
and time-consuming. Given these characteristics, companies willing to 
conduct a BI project should never start it unless managers are convinced 
that its benefits outweigh the cost, known as Return Of Investment 
(ROI). Survey studies conducted by analytical companies conclude that 
the BI technology provides a good payback, in the sense that the average 
ROI for a BI is far above the industry average, confirming the 
added-value of this technology.

With the arrival of Big Data (Gandomi & Haider, 2015), companies owning 
BI applications had to change their strategy and align it. This 
alignment comes from facing the V's brought by Big Data (Volume, 
Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Value). This situation pushes these 
companies to get benefit of distributed programming, cloud computing, 
parallel processing and so on during their BI projects. These 
technologies will have an added value on the final BI projects.

As any database project (Arumugam et al. 2008, Jamapani et al. 2008, 
Jamapani et al. 2011), the BI value has to be evaluated considering 
risks (Berkani et al. 2016, Sales et al., 2018). One of the most 
important risk factors in this context is the lack of satisfaction of 
user requirements (Asnar et al. 2011). This is due to the fact that data 
sources participating in the BI application construction are not rich 
enough in terms of concepts and instances (Ibragimov et al. 2014). This 
limitation can decrease the value of the target BI applications and 
consequently its ROI, since decisions will be made perhaps without data. 
Therefore, building a BI project only from database sources may penalize 
its value. To overcome this risk, recent studies propose augmenting 
traditional BI with external Web sources such as Linked Open Data (LOD) 
and knowledge graphs such as Google Knowledge Graph and DBpedia. 
Usually, LOD store data with high quality, since important efforts in 
curation, cleaning, entity resolution, etc. are deployed (Sadiq & 
Indulska, 2017). The price to pay by BI application designers when 
considering LOD is managing data Variety.

Certainly, integrating external resources contribute in augmenting the 
value of BI projects, but may generate other risks during all phases of 
the BI project life cycle (Meehan et al. 2017): Extract, Transform, 
Load, deployment, physical design, analytical, tuning, maintenance phases).

The proposal of this special issue is motivated by the interesting and 
rich discussions between participants during the Dagstuhl seminar 18471 
titled Next Generation Domain Specific Conceptual Modeling: Principles 
and Methods, 18-23 November 2018. At that time, we realize the necessity 
to federate data warehouse research community on value and risk 
management in the era of Big Data and Linked Open Data.

This Special Section serves such a purpose in that it seeks to bring 
researchers and scholars together in focusing on the critical and 
current issues related to risk and value management in the context of 
Business Intelligence Applications in the Era of Big Data and LOD.

Our special section solicits research papers that make new contributions 
to theory, methodology and empirical results. Our proposed Special

_*Submission Guidelines*_

All submissions have to be prepared according to the Guide for Authors 
as published in the Journal website at: 
https://www.elsevier.com/journals/international-journal-of-information-management/0268-4012/guide-for-authors

Authors should select “SI: Value-Risk in BI & LOD”, from the “Choose 
Article Type” pull- down menu during the submission process. All 
contributions must not have been previously published or be under 
consideration for publication elsewhere. Link for submission of 
manuscript is https://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/IJIM

A submission based on one or more papers that appeared elsewhere has to 
comprise major value-added extensions over what appeared previously (at 
least 50% new material). Authors are requested to attach to the 
submitted paper their relevant, previously published articles and a 
summary document explaining the enhancements made in the journal version.

All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer-review process that 
will consider programmatic relevance, scientific quality, significance, 
originality, style and clarity.

The acceptance process will focus on papers that address original 
contributions in the form of theoretical, empirical and case research, 
which lead to new perspectives on Risk and Value Management of BI 
applications in the Era of Big Data and LOD. Papers must be grounded on 
the body of scholarly works in this area (exemplified by some of the 
references below) but yet discover new frontiers so that collectively, 
the Special Section will serve communities of researchers and 
practitioners as an archival repository of the state of the art in Value 
and Risk Management applied to BI Application Design in the Era of Big 
Data and LOD.
