Subject: [liste-egc] CLEF'15: Call for short papers on Experimental IR,
 deadline May 17.

CLEF 2015: Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum

Experimental IR meets Multilinguality, Multimodality and Interaction

September 8-11, 2015, Toulouse, France

http://clef2015.clef-initiative.eu/

Submission Deadline: Sunday May 17


CALL FOR PAPERS

The CLEF Conference addresses all aspects of Information Access in any moda=
lity and language. The conference is teamed up with a series of workshops p=
resenting the results of lab-based comparative evaluation. CLEF 2015 is the=
 6th year of the CLEF Conference and the 16th year of the CLEF initiative a=
s a forum for IR Evaluation.  The CLEF conference has a clear focus on expe=
rimental IR as done at the evaluation forums (CLEF Labs, TREC, NTCIR, FIRE,=
 MediaEval, RomIP, SemEval, TAC, =E2=80=A6) with special attention to the c=
hallenges of multimodality, multilinguality, and interactive search.  We in=
vite submissions on significant new insights demonstrated on the resulting =
IR test collections, on analysis of IR test collections and evaluation meas=
ures, as well as on concrete proposals to push the boundaries of the Cranfi=
eld/TREC/CLEF paradigm.

All submissions to the CLEF main conference will be reviewed on the basis o=
f relevance, originality, importance, and clarity. CLEF welcomes papers tha=
t describe rigorous hypothesis testing regardless of whether the results ar=
e positive or negative. Methods are expected to be written so that they are=
 reproducible by others, and the logic of the research design is clearly de=
scribed in the paper. The conference proceedings will be published in the S=
pringer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

TOPICS

Relevant topics for the CLEF 2015 Conference include but are not limited to:

- Information Access in any language or modality: Information retrieval, im=
age retrieval, question answering, search interfaces and design, infrastruc=
tures, etc.

- Analytics for Information Retrieval: theoretical and practical results in=
 the analytics field that are specifically targeted for information access =
data analysis.

- Evaluation Initiatives: Conclusions, lessons learned, impact and projecti=
on of any evaluation initiative after completing their cycle.

- Evaluation: methodologies, metrics, statistical and analytical tools, com=
ponent based, user groups and use cases, ground-truth creation, impact of m=
ultilingual/multicultural/multimodal differences, etc.

- Technology Transfer: Economic impact/sustainability of information access=
 approaches, deployment and exploitation of systems, use cases, etc.

- Interactive Information Retrieval Evaluation: the interactive evaluation =
of IR systems using user-centered methods, evaluation of novel search inter=
faces, novel interactive evaluation methods, simulation of interaction, etc.

- Specific Application Domains: Information access and its evaluation in ap=
plication domains such as cultural heritage, digital libraries, social medi=
a, expert search, health information, legal documents, patents, news, books=
, plants, etc.

FORMAT

Authors are invited to submit electronically original papers, which have no=
t been published and are not under consideration elsewhere, using the LNCS =
proceedings format:

http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-7-72376-0

Short papers (6 pages max.) present new evaluation proposals, developments =
and applications, etc. They can also be position papers.

Papers will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee=
. Selection will be based on originality, clarity, and technical quality. P=
apers should be submitted in PDF format to the following address:
