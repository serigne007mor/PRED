Ph.D Position: Energy optimization in IP networks=20

(Th=C3=A8se CIFRE Huawei France Research Center Paris & Universit=C3=A9 d'A=
ngers)=20





Context and objectives: Global warming has become a major concern for sever=
al decades. Information and communications technology "ICT" sector accounts=
 for between 5% and 9% of the global electricity consumption per year [1], =
and telecommunication networks is taking an important part. Manufacturers h=
ave an urging need to design novel mechanisms/methods to optimize energy. A=
 broad variety of solutions have been proposed to improve energy consumptio=
n in networks [2,3,4,5]. Their ultimate goal is to reach the smallest energ=
y consumption as possible and, in particular, a consumption that is proport=
ional to the utilization of devices. Several studies have shown that most o=
f network devices still demonstrate a non-proportional behavior. However, t=
he situation is quickly evolving with the integration of energy-saving mech=
anisms in hardware components. On top of ongoing hardware improvements, new=
 network management and network control solutions will have to be developed=
 to fully benefits from them, in particular for:=20

    * Network design: A well-designed network architecture can reduce the n=
umber of active devices and power consumption. Identifying which equipment =
to replace can also help.=20
    * Network control: Deciding the configuration of network devices allows=
 to dynamic adapt capacity and power consumption to traffic. Computing ener=
gy-efficient routes also helps.=20



These network design and control solutions depend on multiple factors: netw=
ork devices and their energy-saving mechanisms, traffic fluctuations and us=
er requirements, etc. In this context, decisions need to be carefully taken=
 as they impact Quality of Service (QoS) and reliability (e.g., tolerance t=
o failures). This PhD thesis aims at investigating the integration of advan=
ced models about energy saving mechanisms into network optimization and con=
trol algorithms for the next-generation of telecommunication networks.=20




Concretely, this PhD thesis on Network Optimization / Operations Research w=
ill focus on:=20

    * Optimization under budget constraints: Telecommunication operators ma=
y have budget constraints when it comes to replacing devices in their netwo=
rks and they have to prioritize upgrades for devices. One approach is to re=
place those which reached the end of their life cycle analysis (LCA) or are=
 no longer supported by the manufacturer. Another approach consists in upgr=
ading the most critical devices (those carrying the most traffic or providi=
ng critical services).=20
    * Robust optimization: Given the stochastic nature of traffic fluctuati=
ons, a set of scenarios (such as a multi-period traffic matrix) will be con=
sidered to make long term decision "Network design & Device replacement" an=
d short term decisions "Routing & Device frequency selection", at each peri=
od of the time horizon.=20
    * Multi-objective optimization: Selecting a low "frequency" for devices=
 can lead to energy savings and cost reduction for telecommunications opera=
tors. On the other hand, QoS may be impacted and degraded. Therefore, balan=
cing the objectives of energy efficiency and QoS objectives can be a challe=
nging multi-objective optimization problem.=20



Meta-Heuristic and exact methods are two different approaches that can be u=
sed to tackle the previous challenging optimization problem. Even though Me=
ta-Heuristic methods do not guarantee optimal solutions, they are usually f=
ast and useful with large-scale or complex problems (Stochastic problems [6=
], Multi-objective problems [7]). The hybridization [8] could be a powerful=
 approach that combines the strengths of both methods to solve problems in =
the field of energy efficiency in IP networks. The PhD candidate will first=
 look at exact methods and then develop hybrid ones.=20




Specific Requirements=20




Candidates should have a Master degree in Operation Research, Computer Scie=
nce, or Applied Mathematics from a University or a Grande Ecole. They shoul=
d have a solid background in Combinatorial Optimization. Knowledge of telec=
ommunications will be appreciated.=20
