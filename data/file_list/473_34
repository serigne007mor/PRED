CALL FOR PAPERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1st International Workshop on Confidentiality and Trust management in
the Social Web (CTSW'09)
http://wise2009.ue.poznan.pl/workshop_CTSW.php

October 5-7, 2009, Poznan, Poland

Co-located with the 10th International Conference on Web Information
Systems Engineering  (WISE 2009)
http://wise2009.ue.poznan.pl/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Confidentiality and trust management is a critical problem in large
communities for sharing data on the Internet. This is a fundamental
issue in many applications such as social tagging platforms (e.g.,
flickr, del.icio.us), collaborative management of documents (Wikipedia,
free software communities), auction platforms (e.g., e-bay) and more
generally in what we call social software.

Many challenges are raised by the management of confidentiality in open
communities and this workshop aims to gather contributions on both
theoretical and practical aspects of the problem. More specifically,
the workshop objective is to advance on the following points: (1) better
understand what justifies the use of trust models, how trust is
constructed dynamically between the members of a community, and the
limits of such approaches; (2) the development of confidentiality models
based on trust, in particular, these models have to enable sharing data
between anonymous users and ensure confidentiality (data access control,
guarantee of anonymity) and data integrity (constraints on the evolution
of users own data); (3) the sharing of results and experimental studies
on confidentiality models and tools.

This workshop is intended to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on the management of confidentiality in large
communities of information sharing (social web sites, social networks,
etc.), and to act as a platform for discussing experiences and visions
about open communities, trust and confidentiality management.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
---------------------------------------------------
• Trust and reputation models
• Reputation computation engines
• Trust propagation and measurement
• Access control in open communities
• Confidentiality models based on trust
• Data sharing between anonymous users
• Anonymity preservation
• Privacy preservation
• Data integrity and update constraints
• Experimental studies and commercial systems
