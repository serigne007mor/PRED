MODA 2015: Management of Ontology-Driven Architectures
1st International Workshop in the framework of the
13th International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management
and Applications (SERA 2015)
moda2015.ypbl.net

From the very initial stages of design, smart distributed and collaborative
software systems entail the incorporation of adequate autonomic
capabilities to cope with their short- and long-term architectural
evolution. For such smart and autonomic distributed and collaborative
software, structural and behavioral semantic specifications become vital
for their design, development and runtime management. One promising
approach consists in extending the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) by
integrating it with the semantic dimension of autonomic properties. This
approach can be based on the definition of ontology for CIM, PIM
and PSM level models. As a result, the semantic specifications of such
systems can be obtained through the integration of such ontology based
models with the autonomic properties of self-configuration,
self-optimization, self-protection and self-healing. The purpose of this
track is to explore and disseminate research work in the area of Management
of Ontology-Driven Architectures (MODA). The objective of MODA is to cope
with the complexity involved in designing, developing and maintaining smart
and autonomic distributed and
collaborative software by integrating a variety of architectural
approaches, standards, languages and models. Additionally, MODA would take
into account the required autonomic strategies of monitoring, analysis,
planning and executing in order to ensure that functional and
non-functional requirements are properly considered. This first MODA track
proposes an ideal context for presenting achievements, surveys and
perspectives in the area of ontology-driven approaches applied to software
architecture.

*Topics*
Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, in the following
topic areas:

   - Ontology-driven software design, development, adaptation and evolution:
      - Unified process (UP) and agile methodologies guided by ontologies
      - Software requirements specification and traceability, design
      patterns, quality assurance, software validation and
verification based on
      ontologies
      - Ontology-driven software evolution
      - Autonomic computing based on monitoring, analysis, planning and
      execution guided by ontology-based knowledge base
      - Ontology-driven management of software architecture:
      - Service oriented architecture (SOA)
      - Service component architecture (SCA/OSGi)
      - Event-driven architecture (EDA)
      - Business process (BPMN/BPEL) and enterprise service bus (ESB)
      - Service composition, orchestration and choreography
      - Ontology-driven Cloud Computing Architectures
      - Ontology-driven Big Data Architectures
