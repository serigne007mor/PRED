Title:
Joint Inference in Information Extraction and Social Network Analysis

Abstract:

In this talk I will describe recent research at the intersection of
information extraction, data mining and social network analysis.  In
particular I will focus on how such a combination can be made both
robust and scalable---showing that the typical brittle cascading of
errors from information extraction to data mining can be avoided with
unified probabilistic inference in graphical models, and showing that
these models can be made efficient with recent methods of approximate
inference and learning.  After briefly introducing conditional random
fields, I will demonstrate their use in joint models of extraction,
entity resolution, and sequence alignment.

I will then describe two methods of integrating textual data into a
particular type of data mining---social network analysis.  In one
model, we discover role-similarity between entities by examining not
only network connectivity, but also the words communicated on on those
edges; I'll demonstrate this method on a large corpus of email data
subpoenaed as part of the Enron investigation.  In another model, we
discover groups of entities and the "topical" conditions under which
different groupings arise; I'll demonstrate this on coalition
discovery from many years worth of voting records in the U.S. Senate
and the U.N.  I'll conclude with further examples of graphical models
successfully applied to relational data, as well as discussion of
their applicability to trend analysis, expert-finding and
bibliometrics.

Joint work with colleagues at UMass: Charles Sutton, Aron Culotta,
Chris Pal, Ben Wellner, Michael Hay, Xuerui Wang, Natasha Mohanty,
David Mimno, Gideon Mann, Wei Li, and Andres Corrada.

Andrew McCallum is an Associate Professor and Director of the
15-person Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory in the
Computer Science Department at University of Massachusetts Amherst.
He was previously Vice President of Research and Development at
WhizBang Labs, a company that used machine learning for information
extraction from the Web.  In the late 1990's he was a Research
Scientist and Coordinator at Justsystem Pittsburgh Research Center,
where he spearheaded the creation of CORA, an early research paper
search engine that used machine learning for spidering, extraction,
classification and citation analysis.  McCallum received his PhD from
the University of Rochester in 1995, followed by a post-doctoral
fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University.

He is the recipient of two NSF ITR awards, the UMass NSM Distinguished
Research Award, the UMass Lilly Teaching Fellowship, and the IBM
Faculty Partnership Award.  He is the Program Co-chair for the
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2008, and a member
of the boards of the International Machine Learning Society, the CRA
Community Computing Consortium and the editorial board of the Journal
of Machine Learning Research.  He has given tutorials or invited talks
on information extraction at NIPS, KDD, ACL, MSRA, and elsewhere.

For the past ten years, McCallum has been active in research on
statistical machine learning applied to text, especially information
extraction, co-reference, information integration, document
classification, clustering, finite state models, semi-supervised
learning, and social network analysis.  New work on search and
bibliometric analysis of open-access research literature can be found
at http://rexa.info.
