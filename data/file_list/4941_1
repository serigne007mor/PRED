Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is an important agenda across ev=
ery field in the world. Language as a major part of communication should=
 be inclusive and treat everyone equally. A large internet community tha=
t uses language technology has a direct impact on people across the glob=
e. EDI are crucial to make everyone valued and include, so it is necessa=
ry to build language technology that serves this purpose. Our special is=
sue focuses on bringing together research into inclusivity of gender, ra=
cial, sexual orientation, persons with disability, and other minorities =
in language technologies with the aim to build and use datasets addressi=
ng the concerns of EDI.
The broader objective of special issue will be
=E2=97=8F To investigate challenges related to language resource creatio=
n for EDI.
=E2=97=8F To promote research in inclusive language technology.
=E2=97=8F To adopt and adapt appropriate language technology models to s=
uit EDI.
=E2=97=8F To provide opportunities for researchers from the language tec=
hnology community from around the world to collaborate with other resear=
chers to identify and bring possible solutions
to challenges of EDI.


Our special issue theme is to be more inclusive and bring researchers to=
 make language technology of more inclusive nature. We hope that through=
 these engagements we can develop language technology tools to be more i=
nclusive of everyone including marginalized people.



*Call for Papers*
Our main theme in this special issue is to bring equality, diversity, an=
d inclusivity in language technologies. We invite researchers and practi=
tioners to submit papers reporting on these issues and datasets to avoid=
 these issues. We also encourage qualitative studies related to these is=
sues and how
to avoid them. Our special issue welcomes theoretical and practical pape=
r submissions on any languages that contribute to research in Equality, =
Diversity and Inclusion. We will particularly encourage studies that add=
ress either practical application or improving resources.




*Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:*
=E2=97=8F Corpus development to include EDI
=E2=97=8F Gender inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F LGBT inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F Racial inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F Persons with disability inclusivity in language technology
=E2=97=8F Unconscious bias and how to avoid them in language technologie=
s
=E2=97=8F Tackling rumors and fake news about gender, racial, and LGBT m=
inorities.
=E2=97=8F Tackling discrimination against gender, racial, and LGBT minor=
ities.


*Important dates*
=E2=97=8F April 26, 2021: First Call for Papers
=E2=97=8F September 6, 2021: Paper Due Date
=E2=97=8F December 8, 2021: First round of reviews
=E2=97=8F March 2, 2022: Second round of reviews
=E2=97=8F August-December, 2022: Manuscripts publication (tentative)



*Types of Papers*
FULL-LENGTH PAPERS should describe original, substantive research result=
s involving any aspect of the creation, use, or evaluation of language r=
esources, or provide a detailed description of a new and substantial maj=
or resource. In the latter case, the submission should provide a detaile=
d description of the methods used to create and evaluate the resource an=
d provide a comparison with similar resources, where appropriate. Full-l=
ength submissions are typically 18-25 pages in length.


SURVEY ARTICLES provide a comprehensive overview of some area or substan=
tial resource relevant to the LRE readership. Survey articles should be =
written with an eye toward providing an entry point for those who work i=
n the field but are not familiar with the particular area or resource, i=
ncluding context, history, and comprehensive references. Survey articles=
 follow the same format as full-length papers.



PROJECT NOTES may describe significant interim research or resource deve=
lopment results, or provide a description of software, standards, minor =
resources, or projects that are of interest to the journal's readership.=
 Project notes are typically 8-10 pages in length, but no minimum or max=
imum
length is required.


SQUIBS provides a forum for expressing an opinion on topics of interest =
to the LRE readership. We are especially interested in articles that pro=
vide a perspective and/or consider solutions or ways forward for issues =
of current interest to the field. Squibs are typically 6-8 pages in leng=
th.



*Manuscript Submission*
Submission of a manuscript implies: that the work described has not been=
 published before; that it is not under consideration for publication an=
ywhere else; that its publication has been approved by all co-authors, i=
f any, as well as by the responsible authorities =E2=80=93 tacitly or ex=
plicitly =E2=80=93 at the institute where the work has been carried out.=
 The publisher will not be held legally responsible should there be any =
claims for compensation.




*Permissions*
Authors wishing to include figures, tables, or text passages that have a=
lready been published elsewhere are required to obtain permission from t=

e evidence that such permission has been granted when submitting their p=
apers. Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to or=
iginate from the authors.




*Online Submission*
Please go to https://www.springer.com/journal/10579/submission-guideline=
s and follow the hyperlink =E2=80=9CSubmit manuscript=E2=80=9D on the ri=
ght and upload all of your manuscript files following the instructions g=
iven on the screen (please use the article type =E2=80=9CS.I.: LTP=E2=80=
=9D, for =E2=80=9CSpecial Issue on Language Technology for Equality, Div=
ersity, and Inclusion=E2=80=9D).


Please ensure you provide all relevant editable source files. Failing to=
 submit these source files might cause unnecessary delays in the review =
and production process.

*About Journal*
The official journal of European Language Resources Association (ELRA <h=
ttp://www.elra.info/en/>), is the first international journal devoted to=
 the acquisition, creation, annotation and use of language resources, to=
gether with methods for evaluation of resources, technologies and applic=
ations.

Language resources include language data and descriptions in machine rea=
dable form used to assist and augment language processing applications, =
such as written or spoken corpora and lexica, multimodal resources, gram=
mars, terminology or domain specific databases and dictionaries, ontolog=
ies, multimedia databases etc., as well as basic software tools for thei=
r acquisition, preparation, annotation, management, customization and us=
e. The evaluation of language technologies consists in assessing the sta=
te-of-the-art for a given technology, comparing different approaches to =
a given problem, assessing the availability of resources and technologie=
s for a given application and assessing system usability and user satisf=
action.

                            similar resources, where appropriate.
                            Full-length submissions are typically 18-25

                            Survey articles should be written with an
                            eye toward providing an entry point for
                            those who work in the field but are not

                            comprehensive references. Survey articles
                            follow the same format as full-length
