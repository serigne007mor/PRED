Soc2Net: 2nd International workshop on Modeling and Mining
Social-Media-driven Complex Networks  @ ASONAM 2020

Virtual Event: Due to the uncertainty about sanitary measures and travel
restrictions, Soc2Net 2020 is planned fully online as a virtual event.

CONTEXT

The growing availability of multi-faceted social media data gives rise to
unprecedented opportunities for unveiling complex real-world online
behaviors. This also supports  the proliferation of complex network models
where the expressive power of the graph-based relational structure  is
enhanced through exposing several types of  features that are   peculiar of
the social media platforms. This workshop aims to explore  innovative
methods that are designed to improve our understanding of behaviors and
relations underlying feature-rich networks built upon social media, here
called social-media-driven complex networks. Exemplary network models of
such kind include heterogeneous,   multilayer/multiplex/multirelational
networks, temporal, location-aware, and probabilistic networks, and any
other type of data-driven network that can be inferred from social media
data contexts.
The aim of the Soc2Net workshop, that will be held as a virtual event in
conjunction with The 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in
Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2020), is to bring together
researchers and practitioners from around the world interested in 1)
exploring different perspectives and approaches to mine social-media-driven
complex networks, 2) analyzing user behavior and evolution in
social-media-driven complex networks, and 3) building models and frameworks
for evaluating the respective approaches.
Authors are encouraged to evaluate their models, methods, metrics and
algorithms on real-world social networks built upon publicly available
datasets. We solicit interdisciplinary submissions focusing on topics of
interest to different research communities, including social science,
economics and digital humanities.

SUBMISSION


We welcome original contributions, including papers discussing ongoing
research projects.
Contributions can be of two types: either short position papers (2 to 3
pages including references) or full research papers (6 to 8 pages including
references).
Papers must follow the IEEE two-column template, in compliance to the main
conference.
Accepted contributions will be made available electronically through the
CEUR Workshop Proceedings platform (http://ceur-ws.org).
Authors of selected contributions will have the opportunity to submit an
extended version of their accepted paper (either type) to the Frontiers in
Big Data journal (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data).
