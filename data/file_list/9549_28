CALL FOR PAPERS

3rd International Workshop on WEB INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNITIES (WI&C'11)
http://www.emse.fr/wic/
(ex WIVE Workshop)

to be held at the 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on WEB 
INTELLIGENCE and INTELLIGENT AGENT TECHNOLOGY (WI-IAT'11)
Lyon, France, August, 2011

*Important Dates:*

Paper submission deadline: March 21th, 2011
Acceptance notification : June 1st, 2011
Camera ready paper : June 10th, 2011
Workshop : August 22th, 2011

*SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP*

Internet is a medium allowing services and information exchange in an 
open and decentralized environment, notably with numerous applications 
for virtual enterprises. It concerns enterprise information systems, 
local, regional and governmental organizations but it also involves more 
and more common users in the so-called web 2.0. The main stake is to use 
Internet as a technological support to communication, information 
exchange, service composition personalisation and access by all and 
anywhere. In this perspective, some work has been done these last years 
to combine classical techniques of information management with 
artificial intelligence technologies thus creating a new research domain 
called Web Intelligence.

Web Intelligence is a multidisciplinary area dealing with exploiting 
data and services over the Web, to create new data and services using 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) techniques. The link to Networking and Virtual 
Communities (VCs) is obvious: the web is a set of nodes, providing and 
consuming data and services; the permanent or temporary ties and 
exchanges in-between these nodes build the so-called virtual 
communities; and the ICT and AI techniques contribute to the process and 
automate (or partly automate) communication and cooperation processes.

The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for 
researchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative 
networks, such as virtual communities. The possibilities and 
consequences of the web usage for collaborative networks are tremendous 
and new tools are required to satisfy users and service providers. Thus, 
Web Intelligence brings new research problems related to information and 
service access, quality of service, personalization, privacy preserving, 
trust as well as other issues.

The workshop Web Intelligence and Communities expects contributions on 
topics such as:

     * Multi-agent models and tools for Virtual Communities (VC)
     * Services and Grid Services for VC, Service oriented architectures
     * Web information mining, filtering and retrieval within/for VC
     * Web-based applications and plate-forms for VC
     * Intelligent web interaction, querying, diffusion
     * Semantics and ontology engineering for VC
     * Self-* models and techniques for VC
     * Social networks modelling, virtual communities, social intelligence
     * Context-based approach, profile management, personalization and 
recommendations for/through VC
     * Privacy preserving, security, trust-based computing & reputation 
systems
     * Applications: E-* (market, procurement, technologies, health, 
government, etc.) and VC
     * VC and content and knowledge repositories, behaviour modelling 
and exchange
     * Web intelligence, mobility and VC, Ambient Intelligence, 
Pervasive computing
     * Performances evaluation, experiments, user feed-back
     * Surveys on WI and VC

The WI&C workshop continues the previous series of the WIVE workshop 
held in 2009 and 2010 at Thessalonika and Saint-Etienne, with a more 
general scope on the impact of Web Intelligence for communities.

*SUBMISSIONS*

The Web Intelligence and Communities workshop welcomes the submission of 
theoretical, experimental, methodological as well as application papers. 
Papers may report on completed work, descriptions of work in progress or 
discussion papers.

Submitted papers should be 16 pages maximum in length, including figures 
and references. The paper must be formatted according to the double 
column style guidelines for A4 papers available here: 
http://wi-consortium.org/wias/submissionInst.html

All papers should be prepared in pdf format and submitted on the web 
site for workshop submissions
