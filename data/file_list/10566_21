Scientific Objective
Meta-modeling is a branch of software engineering concerned with
analysis and synthesis of models (descriptions of real world phenomena).
The overall goal of data-mining is to extract information from a data
sets and transform it into
understandable structures for further use.

The scientific objective of this PhD thesis proposal is to investigate
how meta-modeling and
data-mining might complement themselves.

Application Field
MIPS has been involved in several tracking campaigns within the
Internet, and has gathered huge amounts of behavioral data which will
serve as experimental ground for this PhD thesis.
=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=9D was chosen in 2006 as Time magazine =E2=80=9CPerson o=
f the Year=E2=80=9D. Since
then, on-line presence
of individual never stopped to grow. Data generated from on-line
interactions continues
to explode: social platform, e-commerce, on-line video game, blogs, etc.
The challenge is to turn the raw data collected into actionable
insights.
New approaches, tools and methods are now needed to help users to master
they on-line identity, and for marketers to benefit from this great
amount of information to gain competitive edges.
The application field for this PhD thesis might therefore be online
marketing.

Prerequisites
=E2=80=A2 Applicants must have a degree in Computer Science, or in a related
study, with excellent results
=E2=80=A2 Applicants might have an experience in either meta-modeling or
data-mining
=E2=80=A2 Applicants must be able to demonstrate interest in scientific res=
earch
=E2=80=A2 Applicants must have proven writing skills in English (Knowledge =
of
French is not a prerequisite, work will be conducted in English)

Application Candidates should submit the following documents:
=E2=80=A2 Motivation letter (including a research statement)
=E2=80=A2 Curriculum vitae
=E2=80=A2 List of publications (if available)
=E2=80=A2 Copies of diplomas, and university transcript
