10th ESWC 2013 -- Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013, Montpellier, France.

ESWC is the premier European-based annual conference for researchers and pr=
actitioners in the field of semantic technologies. ESWC is the ideal venue =
for the discussion of the latest scientific insights and novel applications=
 of semantic technologies.=20

The leading motto of the 10th edition of ESWC will be "Semantics and Big Da=
ta". A crucial challenge that will guide the efforts of many scientific com=
munities in the years to come is the one of making sense of large volumes o=
f heterogeneous and complex data. Application-relevant data often has to be=
 processed in real time and originates from diverse sources such as Linked =
Data, text and speech, images, videos and sensors, communities and social n=
etworks, etc. ESWC, with its focus on semantics, can offer an important con=
tribution to global challenge.

ESWC 2013 will feature nine thematic research tracks (see below) as well as=
 an in-use and industrial track. In line with the motto "Semantics and Big =
Data", the conference will feature a special track on "Semantic Technologie=
s for Big Data Analytics in Real Time". In order to foster the interaction =
with other disciplines, this year's edition will also feature a special tra=
ck on "Cognition and Semantic Web".

For the research and special tracks, we welcome the submission of papers de=
scribing theoretical, analytical, methodological, empirical, and applicatio=
n research on semantic technologies. For the In-Use and Industrial track we=
 solicit the submission of papers describing the practical exploitation of =
semantic technologies in different domains and sectors. Submitted papers sh=
ould describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigor=
ous, principled, and repeatable evaluation. We strongly encourage and appre=
ciate the submission of papers including links to data sets and other mater=
ial used for the evaluation as well as to live demos or source code for too=
l implementations.=20

Submitted papers will be judged based on originality, awareness of related =
work, potential impact on the Semantic Web field, technical soundness of th=
e proposed methods, and readability. Each paper will be reviewed by at leas=
t three program committee members in addition to one track chair. This year=
 a rebuttal phase has been introduced in order to give authors the opportun=
ity to provide feedback to reviewers' questions. The authors' answers will =
support reviewers and track chairs in their discussion and in taking final =
decisions regarding acceptance.=20=20=20

** Important Dates (11:59pm Hawaii Time) **

ormat) format and will not be accepted in any other format. Papers that exc=
eed 15 pages or do not follow the LNCS guidelines can be rejected automatic=
ally without a review.=20

Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic annotations=
 for the abstract of their submission at the time of acceptance. At least o=
ne author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and prese=
nt the paper there.
