JOB ADVERT: Research Assistant / Associate (Urban Data Mining)
Knowledge Media Institute (KMi)
=C2=A328,695 - =C2=A337,394, Ref: 11069
Based in Milton Keynes
Temporary contract until 31st December 2016

Deadline for applications: Monday 16 March 2015.

We are currently looking for a Research Assistant/Associate to conduct
research into analytics and mining services in the context of the MK:Smart
project.

The successful applicant will investigate novel technologies adapting and
extending state-of the-art machine learning techniques to work with
combinations of large, highly heterogeneous and unbalanced datasets in
generic, parametric data analytics and mining services. He/she will be
expected to experiment with different approaches on the basis of concrete
use cases of value to the project, using real data to solve real data
analytics problems, which can be generalised to other similar problems in
the context of a smart city.

Specific tasks:
* Test and assess the result of machine learning approaches on concrete use
cases with multiple datasets.
* Generalise the results obtained from these use cases, to create novel data
preparation, mining and interpretation approaches working on combinations of
heterogeneous, unbalanced datasets.
* Create generic data analytics and mining services widely applicable to
the MK:Smart project and other similar ones.
* Integrate results in the technical infrastructure of the MK:Smart
project, and collaborate with other members of the team on requirements and
implementations for data management.

The appointment will be made on the Academic Grade 1 or 2 Salary Scales for
Research Staff, ranging from =C2=A328,854 =E2=80=93 =C2=A337,298 pa dependi=
ng on
qualifications and experience. Appointment as a Research Associate requires
a PhD or three years equivalent in quality of achievement.

The Knowledge Media Institute (KMi) of the UK=E2=80=99s Open University is =
a highly
successful interdisciplinary research centre founded at The Open University
in 1995, and located in attractive premises at The Open University's main
campus in Milton Keynes, UK. We offer a stimulating environment, widely
acknowledged to be at the leading edge of research and development,
particularly in Semantic Technologies, Data Science, Human Computer
Interaction, New Media and Information Retrieval.
