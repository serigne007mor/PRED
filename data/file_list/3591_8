Keywords : Artificial Intelligence, Probabilistic Graphical Event Model, 
Ontology, Machine Learning, Surgical Process Modelling.

Context
DUKe (Data User Knowledge) research group at LS2N, UMR CNRS 6004, is one 
of the laboratory's main teams in "Data and Decision Science" field, 
with its skills in data manipulation, data mining and interaction.
Within this framework, the research group has, among other things, 
developed numerous algorithms for learning and manipulating 
probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian networks, dynamic Bayesian 
networks, relational Bayesian networks, graphical event models) gathered 
within the PILGRIM C++ software library.
This PhD thesis is part of the SPARS project (Sequential Pattern 
Analysis in Robotic Surgery: Understanding Surgery), funded by Labex 
CominLabs, in collaboration with LTSI/INSERM/Université Rennes 1 and INRIA.

The objective of this project is to propose data analysis methods to 
better understand complex technical human activities, such as surgery. 
Surgery is a complex activity, that depends on many factors, including 
the patient and surgeon characteristics. Such complexity and variability 
explain why there is almost no detailed study of the surgical practice 
yet. Until now, the surgical procedure performed in the operating room 
is considered as a whole, as a black-box and is technically described 
with few words. Analysis usually consisted in comparing impact of 
different surgical approaches or of different pre-operative clinical 
patient’s parameters on post-operative outcomes. In the SPARS project, 
we will rely on a combination of data and model-driven approaches to 
analyze and compare kinematics of whole surgical procedures acquired 
during robotic assisted hysterectomies.

Funding:
The PhD fellowship is funded for 3 years from september-October 2022.

Profile of the candidate:
The candidate should have a master's degree in computer science or 
equivalent, as well as knowledge of machine learning, probabilistic 
graphical models and knowledge representation. Good skills in machine
learning is mandatory. Some knowledge in knowledge representation will 
be a plus.
The programming environment associated with this project also requires 
some knowledge of C++ programming language.
The personal qualities expected are mainly autonomy and a taste for 
interdisciplinary work, rigour and abstraction, as well as writing 
skills (in French and English).

Application instructions:
The application file should contain the following documents:
* a curriculum vitæ (CV);
* the official academic transcripts of all the candidate’s higher 
education degrees (BSc, License, MSc, Master’s degree, Engineer degree, 
etc.). If the candidate is currently finishing a Master’s degree, s/he
must send the transcript of the grades obtained so far, with the rank 
among her/his peers, and the list of classes taken during the last year;
* some recommendation letters (quality is more important than quantity, 
there);
* and a motivation letter written specifically for this position.

Send all of these documents by email to Philippe.Leray@ls2n.fr, 
thomas.guyet@inria.fr and pierre.jannin@univ-rennes1.fr
