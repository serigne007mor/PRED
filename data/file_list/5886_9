Special Session on Knowledge Graphs in Digitalization Era (KGDE2021)

34th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other 
Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE 2021)

https://ieaaie2021.wordpress.com/special-session-3-kdge/

The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0 (I40), is 
affecting almost every industry worldwide and is rapidly transforming 
how businesses operate in various domains such as: Health, Banking, 
Education, Transportation, Aeromechanics, Urbanization, Manufacturing, 
Petrochemical, Environments. Current trends in I40 includes: advanced 
process automation and robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, Machine-to-Machine and 
Human-to-Machine Communication, and Sensor Technology and Data 
Analytics.  I40 integrates mainly technologies related to Cyber-Physical 
Systems, IoT, AI, Data, and Knowledge in their different forms to reach 
an optimal value-added chain. This chain is associated with complex 
processes, manipulating huge amounts of data issued from different 
providers, systems, and platforms, that must be automated and optimized. 
These processes are usually driven by standards and norms. National and 
International institutions such as ISO, IEC, ETSI, NIST, ANSI, SAC, and 
AFNOR are spending a lot of effort in providing such norms and standards 
to facilitate collaboration, integration, sharing, enrichment of 
processes, their associated data, and then the final products.

The key drivers enabling the I40 trend is the rising data volumes, 
computational power and connectivity. In this context, the notion of 
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) plays a vital role in understanding the emerging 
analytics and business-intelligence capabilities. A Knowledge Graph can 
be considered as a Knowledge Base that consists of a set of concepts 
organized into a taxonomy, instances for each concept, and relationships 
among the instances. The information in a KG can be gathered from a 
variety of sources such as Social, Open, Private (personal/business) and 
IoT data islands. Accordingly, KGs can facilitate understanding the 
businesses’ big data as well as the connectivity between customers and 
supply chains through real-time access to production information, 
logistics and monitoring. The spectacular development of KGs contributes 
at the same time in inspiring enterprises to constitute networks of 
highly recognized authorities of norms and standards and in integrating 
them in their industry and manufacturing processes - the case of the 
Industry 4.0 Knowledge Graph (I40KG) – as well as in considering KGs as 
an important tool to enhance the quality of the value of the developed 
products.

Knowledge Graphs in Digitalization Era (KGDE) will be held as one of the 
sessions of the 34th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering 
& Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE 2021). The 
KGDE session aims at providing a forum for researchers and professionals 
interested in the contributions of Knowledge Graphs Networks in I40.
