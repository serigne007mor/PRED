HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLIED TO FINANCE

Mission

The HPIAF project is a two years project funded by EXQIM S.A.S. and is 
concerned with the application of evolutionary computation to the 
production and improvement of trading automata. The initial population 
is not randomly generated but is a mix of hand-written trading automata 
and randomly generated individuals. These automata are written in a 
proprietary strongly typed functional language which make the automata 
more complex than usual individuals in genetic programming approaches. 
The amount of data to be processed requires the use of parallel 
architectures. The selected candidate is expected to study, define, 
implement and evaluate the appropriate evolutionary algorithms and their 
parameters.
The post-doctoral researcher will work in close collaboration with 
LIFO's HPIAF researchers (Pr F. Loulergue and Dr M. Bamha) and with 
EXQIM researchers who have a long experience of industry-academia 
research collaboration. This collaboration will involve sharing 
realistic data-sets and parallel systems made available by EXQIM, 
sharing and interfacing software libraries with EXQIM while combining 
regular web-conferences with a moderate amount of travel to Paris where 
EXQIM is based.

About EXQIM and LIFO

EXQIM - EXclusive Quantitative Investment Management is a company in the 
legal form of a société par actions simplifiée (S.A.S.), registered 
under French law since June 17, 2009, with a capital of EUR 650,020. 
EXQIM has been approved by the AMF since October 2010 as an asset 
management firm, and launched its first fund in Luxembourg in the first 
quarter of 2011.
EXQIM's business objective is to generate returns for its funds using 
proprietary investment strategies with an exclusively quantitative and 
well-diversified approach. The founding of EXQIM rests on the following 
observations:
Machines do not make mistakes and are more efficient than human beings 
(faster detection&  execution, no emotions).Technological innovations 
have opened new investment horizons.
EXQIM has three fundamental pillars:
- A department for applied financial mathematics research, which 
develops arbitrage models;
- A department for computing research, development and exploitation, 
which is in charge of implementing and monitoring trading automata;
- A department for operational control to ensure the management of risk 
and post-processing.

The Computer Science laboratory of the University of Orleans (LIFO, 
http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo) is a research and doctoral training 
unit recognised and funded by the French Ministry of Research. The 
laboratory specialises in software science. The Parallelism, Virtual 
Reality and Verification (PRV) group conducts research on parallel 
computing and verification and hosts PC clusters for its experiments and 
for the benefit of its industrial partners. This work has been rewarded 
by international, national and regional grants. The group's techniques 
for scalable performance are applied to numerical simulation, databases 
and machine learning. LIFO is a member of the Cascimodot cluster 
federating Loire Valley-region laboratories involved in numerical 
simulations.

Profile

The candidate must hold a doctorate in Computer Science with expertise 
in genetic programming. Experience in some of the following areas is an 
asset:
- strongly typed / constrained GP
- functional programming (especially in ML)
- parallel algorithms and applications
- financial or trading knowledge

The candidate must also be interested in producing high quality research 
reports and software documentations.
Knowledge of French is not required but language courses can be made 
available.

Job conditions

Title: Post-doctoral researcher
Location: Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale d'Orléans, France
Contract: 20 months (8 months term contract + two 6 months renewals)

Application

To apply, send a detailed CV including a list of publications and a 
letter of motivation to Frédéric Loulergue: 
frederic.loulergue@univ-orleans.fr. Deadline for application is 
*October* *31*, *2011*.
