MOTIVATIONS:

Nowadays, many different applications in different areas (e-learning, 
digital libraries,
search engines, online databases, e-commerce, social networks, 
ubiquitous computing, ...)
are concentrating on collecting information about users for service 
personalization.

Because any specific network representation (in a specific application) 
uses different
network models and different user modeling, aim of this workshop is to 
organize a common
discussion among different scientific and industrial communities on 
evolving and secure
multi-application personalization.

A first problem to address in this kind of scenario is to define 
accurately what the
profile content is and how to represent users' properties and behaviors. 
Even for
mono-application profiles there are several definitions and structure 
models, content
categories and profile creation and enrichment methods. Are these 
techniques still valid
in a multi-application context?

The profile management has to be user-centric. The user has to be an 
active actor and
needs to be aware and to be able to control the stored information and 
its evolution. How
to find and group similar profiles to enrich them mutually? Are similar 
profiles part of
the same social community? How the profile modifications caused by an 
application affect
the profile for another application? How to make the profile 
context-sensitive?

The user-centric character of the profile management means also that the 
actions of the
user could affect the profile in an automatic manner. User tasks and 
action history model
has to be taken into account in profile management.

Another difficulty with multi-application profiles is the security 
management due to
profile data and structure sharing among different applications. Users 
must have the
possibility to manage the confidentiality of their data in a direct and 
practical fashion.
A credible solution must come with data security management taking into 
account user needs
and application requirements. Which profile content can be shared, 
modified and used by
several applications? What is useful, what is necessary and what is 
forbidden to be
shared? How to guarantee users anonymity and privacy? How to prevent 
identity disclosure
when profile content is shared among applications? Which trust and 
reputation techniques
could be taken into account?
