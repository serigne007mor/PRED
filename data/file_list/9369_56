Subject: [liste-egc] PhD Position: Ontology Alignment for Query Pattern
 Rewriting in Semantic Question Answering Systems

PhD Position on Ontology Alignment for Query Pattern Rewriting in 
Semantic Question Answering Systems

We are looking for a candidate with a background in Knowledge 
Representation and Semantic Web to join the MELODI team 
(http://www.irit.fr/-Equipe-MELODI-), for working on query pattern 
rewriting using complex ontology alignments.

Context

SPARQL is the standard de facto language for querying linked data 
sources [1]. However, SPARQL is not the most suitable query language for 
final (or non expert) users [2]. For hiding the complexity of SPARQL, 
translating natural language based-queries into SPARQL queries is the 
object of researches in both Natural Language Processing and Semantic 
Web fields. Different approaches to the problem have emerged from the 
literature, such as the ones using (pre-written) query patterns [3], 
guiding the user in the formalisation of queries [6], or extending 
SPARQL with keywords [7]. With respect to pattern-based approaches, one 
of the main limitations is related to the fact that reusing patterns 
across different data sets can be done in a very limited extent. For 
each data source to be queried, the corresponding query patterns have to 
be (manually) built. Considering that query patterns are defined from 
the ontologies describing the data set to be queried, one direction for 
automating the generation of query patterns is to exploit ontology 
matching approaches.

Ontology matching is the task of finding correspondences that link 
concepts, properties or instances from two ontologies [4]. The different 
approaches proposed for performing this task can be classified according 
to the features (labels, structures, instances, semantics) they take 
into account within the matching process or with regard to the kind of 
disciplines they belong to (e.g., statistics, combinatorial, semantics, 
linguistics, machine learning, or data analysis). Most of proposed 
approaches focus on one-to-one correspondences between named ontology 
elements. However, this kind of correspondence is not always sufficient 
to describe the true relationship between related entities in diverse 
ontologies, and complex correspondences are needed instead [9]. Complex 
correspondences can be required for a range of applications, including 
query rewriting [8,10].

Objectives

The aim of this thesis is twofold. The first objective is to propose a 
novel approach for generating complex correspondences between two 
ontologies. Second, the aim is to exploit such kind of correspondences 
for supporting the tasks of query patterns generation and rewriting.

Profile

We are looking for qualified candidates with Msc in Computer 
Engineering/Science or an adjacent field, with a background in Knowledge 
Representation (in particular, vocabularies and ontologies) and 
standards of the Semantic Web (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL). We appreciate 
applicants with knowledge on ontology matching and question answering 
systems. Fluent English is not mandatory.

Application deadline : 10/04/2015
