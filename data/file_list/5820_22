Hello,

Sorry for multiple postings.

Ladjel.



*1st IEEE International Workshop on Data Engineering and Modeling for AI 
(DEMAI)**
**https://www2.cs.uh.edu/~dss/DEMAI/**
**
**Sponsored by IEEE Big Data 2023**
**http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2023/**
**
**December 15-18, 2023 – Sorrento, Italy*

*****************************************************************************************************************************************

*Special Issue for DEMAI Papers in DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING JOURNAL 
(DKE), Elsevier, Ranked Q2, IF: 2.5
*

*https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-and-knowledge-engineering*

*****************************************************************************************************************************************


*Scope*

Nowadays AI is becoming the ultimate goal of almost any analytic 
project. On the other hand, there is a new trend in building systems and 
novel approaches, which enable analysis of practically any kind of data: 
big or small, unstructured or structured, static or streaming, and so on 
(new generation Big Data). Data science is the interdisciplinary 
approach to analyzing data, going from detecting data quality problems, 
spending significant time on data pre-processing, and ending up with 
some sophisticated Machine Learning model (e.g. commonly a neural network).

In this workshop, we welcome research that focuses on data aspects, 
before an ML model is computed. That is, we seek contributions on data 
pre-processing, data models, managing diverse file formats, standard 
data formats, and so on. We also welcome traditional "analytic" papers, 
provided they elaborate on how data sets were cleaned, preprocessed, 
integrated, and transformed before computing ML models.

*Topics*

  * Data integration from diverse sources
  * Creating input vectors or matrices for an ML model
  * Detecting and solving data quality issues to improve model quality
  * Interoperability of diverse data pre-processing programs, working
    with different file formats
  * Splitting processing between languages and Big Data systems (e.g. R
    or Python runtime alone and PySpark in a cluster)
  * Extending data science languages with new operators and functions
    (e.g. numpy or pytorch)
  * Accelerating ML algorithms (statistical summarization, stochastic
    gradient descent)
  * Enabling database query functionality in data science languages
    (e.g. optimizing Pandas code)
  * Cross-language optimization (e.g. optimizing R bottlenecks with
    C/C++ code)
  * Splitting processing between data science languages and database
    languages (e.g. Python and SQL)
  * Novel parallel data processing architectures (e.g. combining
    parallel DBMSs, Hadoop, and other distributed architectures)
  * Exploiting new-generation file systems beyond HDFS (HPC file systems)
  * Flexible, fast, well-defined interfaces to exchange big data (e.g.
    CSV, JSON files).
  * Exploiting HPC libraries like LAPACK and MKL in data science languages
  * Web interfaces for complex processing pipelines (e.g. JavaScript
    GUI, calling Python)
  * Benchmarks, understanding tradeoffs between time performance and
    ease of use (i.e. the fastest is not necessarily the best alternative)
  * Case studies, presenting technical details of a library or program
    that can be used by data analysts across several specialties (i.e.
    how it was programmed and deployed in some OS)


*Dates*

  * Aug 1: 1st cycle short papers (to get early notification)
  * Nov 3: 2nd cycle (forwarded papers, late notification, after the
    main conference)
  * Dec TBD, 2023: Workshop


*Submission*
We welcome short papers in IEEE double-column format. Early submission 
is encouraged. We will also consider rejected papers forwarded from the 
conference, which will receive at least 2 additional reviews. Authors of 
rejected papers from the conference will have an opportunity to revise 
their papers.

All accepted papers will appear in the IEEE proceedings. All accepted 
papers will be invited for Data and Knowledge Engineering (DKE), 
Elsevier. All invited papers will go through a 2nd round of reviews to 
decide which papers will be published in the DKE Journal.

  * Short papers (encouraged): up to 5 pages
  * Full papers: 10 pages


*Program Co-Chairs*

  * Carlos Ordonez, University of Houston, USA
  * Ladjel Bellatreche, ISAE-ENSMA, France


*Program Committee Members*

You are welcome to ask any questions about potential submissions
