PhD Students Session on the Extraction and Management of Knowledge
November 13, 2012
http://egcm.uae.ma/index.php/en/
(Held in conjunction with EGC-M 2012, Hammamet, Tunisia, November 12-15, 2012)

Goals:
The 2012 PhD Students session provides a forum for both early and late-stage PhD students to present their research and get detailed feedback and advice. The main objectives of this event are:
1. To allow PhD students to practice papers writing and to present their research proposal.
2. To get constructive feedback from other researchers.
3. To build bridges for potential research collaborations.
4. To contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers at the main conference.

The second edition of the PhD Student Session will be held as part of EGC-M 2012 conference, Hammamet, Tunisia. This session is addressed primarily to novice PhD students. The goal is to allow participants to present their research ideas and gain feedback from the rest of the workshop and conference attendees. Each participant will give a 10 minute presentation, followed by 5 minutes of discussions. The PhD Students session has the same scope of technical topics as the main EGC-M 2012 conference.

Author information's:
To participate, please submit:
* 3 pages position paper in the ACM format (double column), presenting your idea or current work.
* A support letter from your advisor. The advisor should e-mail this letter to conference chairs.
The position paper should contain (at least):
* A problem description.
* A detailed sketch of a proposed approach.
* Related works.

Research proposals should include the following information:
* Title
* Your name and contact information
* Your supervisor?s name and contact information
* Abstract
* Research area and sub-area of your work
* What is the problem?
* What is the significance of this problem?
* Brief literature review, and how the proposed research fits in within existing research in the field
* Description of proposed research methodology
* Results achieved so far (if any)
* The expected contributions of your research
As this is earlier-stage research, it is not necessary to have concrete results from this research presented in the paper. Instead, the goal of the paper is to inform the reader of a (well-motivated) problem and to present a sketch of a solution.
Contributions, written in English or French, must be formatted according to the guidelines of the ACM style (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). The length of the contribution must be no more than 3 pages double column in the ACM format, including figures, title pages, references and appendices. Any submission that exceeds length limits or deviates from formatting requirements may be rejected without review. Only papers using the LaTeX typesetting system in formatting the paper are accepted.
Reviewing criteria:
Submissions will be assessed by the Committee, using as basis the following criteria:

* Quality of the research proposal, which should include a clear and concise statement of the research questions or problem being addressed, and its importance.
* Discussion about related works, and how your research will contribute to the field.
* Relevance of your submission to the PhD session using as basis the PhD technical topics.
* Quality of the references cited.
* Quality of the presentation.
* The degree of support of the letter written by your main supervisor.

Important Dates:
* Submission due                      : July 20, 2012
