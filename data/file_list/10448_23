			   Call for Papers
     IEEE IJCNN 2015 Special Session on "Multiple Clusterings"
       July 12 - 17, 2015, Killarney, Ireland.

----------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission:  January 15th, 2015
Paper Decision notification: March 15th, 2015
Camera-ready submission: April 15th, 2015
Conference Dates: July 12 - 17th, 2015
----------------------------------------------------------

*DESCRIPTION*
Currently, more and more data are collected from multiple sources or
represented by multiple views (e.g., text, video, images, biological
data, among others). In this context, clustering techniques are often
required to be able to provide several possibilities for analyzing the
data. As a consequence, in recent years, the interdisciplinary
research topic on multiple clusterings has drawn significant attention
of the data mining community.

The research in such a field encompasses those of well-established
areas, such as cluster ensemble, multi-objective clustering,
multi-view clustering and constraint-based clustering. In this special
session, we aim at bringing together researchers from these areas to
discuss questions in multiple clusterings.


*TOPICS*
Papers must present original work or review the state-of-the-art in
the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

- Cluster ensemble
- Multi-objective clustering
- Multi-view clustering
- Constraint-based clustering
- Semi-supervised clustering
- Model selection and visualization
- Applications (e.g., document mining, bioinformatics, marketing,
among others)

*SUBMISSION*

IMPORTANT: the ** deadline ** for paper submission to special sessions
is the same of that of IJCNN 2015, ** January 15th 2015***.


Prospective authors are invited to submit papers via the IJCNN 2015
conference submission system at:

http://www.ijcnn.org/paper-submission

Please make sure to select the Special Session "Multiple clusterings"
from the "S. SPECIAL SESSION TOPICS" name in the "Main Research topic"
drop-down list. Templates and instruction for authors are provided on
the IJCNN website.

All papers submitted to the special sessions will be subject to the
same peer-review procedure as regular papers. Accepted papers will be
published in the conference proceedings.
