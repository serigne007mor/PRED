CALL FOR PAPERS MCIS 2008
www.mcis2008.org

The Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS 2008) focuses on
the distinctive characteristics and goals of Mediterranean countries
concerning the applications of information technologies and information
systems. A key objective of this conference is to develop a network of IS
researchers interested in topics associated with the Mediterranean region.

The 2008 Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems will take place
from October 23 to 26 in the beautiful and unique setting of Hammamet,
Tunisia.

The program chairs, Mokhtar Amami, Par Agerfalk, Carlo Batini and Johnathan
Wareham invite you to join us and contribute to this special conference via
seven different avenues:

.  Tourism, Cultural Heritage and Diversity
   track chair: Marianna Sigala, Jamie Murphy and Oleg Missikof

.  Networks of SMEs
   track chair: Barbara Pernici and Alice Guilhon du Hellen

.  Creativity and Innovation
   track chairs: Joan Rodon and Feliciano Sese

.  Strategic planning and requirement engineering in eGovernment
   track chairs: Carlo Batini and Henda Hajjami Ben Ghezala

.  Flexible IS development
   track chairs: Jolita Ralyte

.  General track
   track chair: Mohkthar Amami


Tourism and Cultural Heritage (Track chair: Marianna Sigala Jamie Murphy and
Oleg Missikof)

Mediterranean countries rely on tourism and travel, which represented the
3rd largest (7.3%) worldwide export of goods and services in 2002 (World
Tourism Organization). The distinction is the willingness of governments to
base this tourism on cultural heritage, especially city tourism. According
to the European Commission (2001), Europe's cultural
heritage is a "unique public asset" that provides a foundation for "the
development of our content industry in a sustainable knowledge society".
European cultural tourism is an important industry commanding a larger
market share of international tourism arrivals than North America. However,
Europe's revenue per arrival lag North America's. Even though France, Spain
and Italy were the world's 1st, 2d and 4th cultural tourism destinations in
2003, their tourism receipts also lag the USA (World Tourism Organization,
2004). Have Americans emphasized interpretive services versus Europeans who
emphasized academic functions of museums and other cultural assets? Will new
information technologies such as broadband and always-on wireless IT be an
enabler for reaping the benefits -- economic, political and cultural -- of
Europe's cultural heritage as a tourism and historical-socio-political
asset?

Networks of SMEs (Track chairs: Barbara Pernici and Alice Guilhon du Hellen)

European and Mediterranean countries rely extensively on networks of SMEs.
This is the basis of the theory of "industrial district" especially
developed in the UK and in Italy. The challenges of managing Networks of
SMEs require the development of inter-organizational information systems
such as EDI over the Internet (EOI), Extranet with their B2B electronic
marketplaces and any information systems that are developed to ensure
visibility, integration and synchronization of the supply chain. Major
issues: 1) Role of IT in connecting people, isolated SMEs and universities
research groups to form networks and foster entrepreneurship and innovation;
2) Development of websites to develop weak ties networks among Mediterranean
countries that are useful for entrepreneurship and innovation; 3)
Information Technology and changes in information and physical flows, cost
structures and market forces that IT causes throughout the traditional value
chain of SMEs particularly in developing countries; and finally 4) Open
Innovation & IT Based Entrepreneurship.

Creativity and Innovation (Track chairs: Joan Rodon and Feliciano Sese)

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) bring new opportunities for
creativity and innovation in the limits of human interaction and social
enterprise. Some practitioners have emphasized the need to invest in
business innovation rather than simply on ICT. On the other hand, others
have emphasized that the implementation of rationalized systems, the case of
ERP and CRM, quite often reduces the opportunity of end users to innovate.
This track encourages both theoretical and empirical papers that 1) explore
the use of ICT in processes of innovation and creativity in teams,
organizations and business networks, 2) explore the limits of creativity and
innovation that new rationalized ICT systems pose to social actors, 3)
examine different forms of innovation in the adoption and use of ICT
applications, as well as papers that 4) conceptualize the concepts of
creativity and innovation in the context of organizations and business
networks from the perspective of information systems.

Strategic planning and requirement engineering in eGovernment (Track chairs:
Carlo Batini Henda Hajjami Ben Ghezala)

What are the consequences of the fact that European and Mediterranean
countries have active public sectors for e-Government, e-Health Care, and
e-Learning? What are the consequences of the European policies on IS
management in our countries, especially the European requests for proposals,
like the Information Society technologies? Furthermore, what is the impact
on IS development? What are the existing methodology for the planning and
design of value added eGovernment initiatives? As software development has a
relevant role in enabling the change enacted by eGovernment in the public
sector, requirements engineering is strategic for the development of
Information Systems that aims to understand and translate users¹ needs into
effective solutions; in particular, requirements have to reflect cultures
and languages and local needs in the context of Mediterranean Countries. On
the basis of requirements that align social and IT perspectives, the
planning of value added initiatives and the development of sustainable
solutions becomes a collaborative activity across different countries.
 

Global Software Development (Track chairs: Samir Tata and Faiez Gargouri)

Mediterranean countries include Developing Countries are facing the
globalization and the commoditization phenomenon. This track will be devoted
to study the consequences of these phenomenon on IS management in the
Mediterranean countries. Particularly the track will focus on the impacts of
Global Software Development (GSD), IS Risk Management and Cross-National IS
Project Management. Major issues: 1) cultural and communication differences
and challenges of managing functionality, cost, duration and risk of GSD; 2)
commoditization of hardware, bandwidth and software and migration of value
to proprietary applications on commodity systems; 3) approaches, methods,
tools, best practices and GSD; 4) the role of Free and Open Software in GSD;
5) Open and non-organizational software development; 6) artifact, use,
global software development and reality construction; and finally 7) how
does global software development may benefit Mediterranean developing
countries?

Flexible IS development (Track chairs: Jolita Ralyte)

Information systems engineering situations vary considerably from project to
project. Application domain, project objectives (e.g. IS evolution,
interoperability), product features (e.g. web-based, mobile,
service-oriented), licence form (open source v. proprietary), stakeholders
involved, team structure (distributed v. co-located), and various
technological conditions and constraints all have a significant impact on
the IS development process. To deal with such a variability of situations
ISD methods are evolving from rigid and monolithic to flexible, modular and
configurable ones. Besides, it is recognized within the area of situational
method engineering that each ISD project requires tailored or specific
methods and tools. This track will be dedicated to study flexibility of ISD
processes, methods and tools and their adaptability to the characteristics
of ISD projects in the European and Mediterranean countries. Major issues:
1) Requirements for flexibility in ISD projects, 2) ISD project situation
assessment and modelling, 3) Method engineering techniques for
situation-specific ISD method construction, 3) Domain-specific ISD
processes,  4) Agile methods for ISD, 5) Experience and case studies of
building and tailoring ISD methods, techniques and tools.

General track (Track chair: Mohkthar Amami)

We invite you to submit completed research papers, exploratory research
papers, panel proposals, and workshops, about IS, especially Mediterranean
IS, and about philosophy and epistemology in IS. Although you are welcome on
relying on the distinctions noted above, we also encourage you to challenge
them. Papers or panels allowing comparative points of view about IS research
or with other social and design sciences will be especially welcome,
particularly if they allow us to make progress in the quest for a European ­
possibly Mediterranean - identity in IS research.

Research Papers (extended abstracts maximum 1000 words; research papers
maximum 10 pages).
Research papers should report on completed research. Research papers will be
published in the official research series of AIS (e-Library).

Exploratory papers (extended abstracts maximum 1000 words; exploratory
papers maximum 4 pages)
Exploratory papers should present ideas that could benefit from discussion
with members of the MCIS community. These papers may include
work-in-progress, experiences of reflective practitioners, and first drafts
of novel concepts and approaches.

Panels (2 page proposal)
Panel proposals on topics that include methods, practices, and other areas
of interest is solicited. Panels will take place at the end of the paper
sessions.


Exploratory papers will be published together with Workshop and Panel
descriptions.
