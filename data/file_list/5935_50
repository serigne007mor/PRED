*** The deadline for submitting to the Doctoral Consortium is extended =
to 31 December 2018 (AoE time zone) ***

The ECIR 2019 Doctoral Consortium is an excellent forum for PhD students =
to discuss their research ideas with world-class researchers in the area =
of information retrieval.

The consortium will take place on 14th April 2019 with the following =
procedure:
Student presentations are followed by discussions and individual =
meetings with established information retrieval researchers who are =
members of the Doctoral Consortium Committee (also called "mentors").
There are great opportunities for networking over lunch and later on =
during the day and other possible activities may be introduced according =
to the topics of the accepted submissions.
A selected submission will be given "best doctoral consortium paper =
award", which will be decided by the doctoral consortium committee.

Prospective candidates for the Doctoral Consortium

Students who have recently completed their research proposal, or about =
to do so are welcome to submit their contribution to the consortium. The =
greatest benefit will be achieved for those students that have recently =
scoped their PhD topic in the information retrieval area.

Candidates for the Doctoral Consortium will be selected based on the =
potential of their research for future impact on the field of =
Information Retrieval and the likely benefit to the student of =
participating in the Consortium. The submitted paper will be the basis =
for detailed discussions at the Consortium.

Submission Guidelines

The submission may contain previously-published material, as well as =
ongoing work. Doctoral students who submit to the Consortium are welcome =
to submit other papers or posters to ECIR 2019.
The submission has two parts. The first part, a research statement, =
should be no more than six (6) pages long. It will be the basis for =
detailed discussions at the Consortium, and should include:

 *   Motivation for the proposed research.
 *   Background and related work (including key references).
 *   Description of proposed research, including main research =
questions.
 *   Research methodology and proposed experiments (where appropriate).
 *   Specific research issues for discussion at the Doctoral Consortium.

The second part, limited to one (1) page, describes benefits that would =
be obtained by attending the Consortium. It should be added as an =
appendix to the research statement and include:

 *   A statement by the student saying why they want to attend the =
Consortium.
 *   A brief statement (1 paragraph) by their advisor saying how the =
student would benefit by attending the Consortium. Advisors should also =
specifically state whether the student has written, or is close to =
completing, a thesis proposal (or equivalent), and when they expect the =
student would defend their dissertation if they progress at a typical =
rate.

Note
Students are also welcome to submit (preliminary) experimental work. =
With such submissions, students might seek feedback on their methodology =
and/or results.

Format Requirements
All submissions must be written in English following the ECIR =
guidelines<http://irsg.bcs.org/proceedings/ECIR_Draft_Guidelines.pdf>
and the LNCS author =
guidelines<http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-pro=
ceedings-guidelines> and submitted electronically through =
EasyChair<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Decir2019>.

The first page must contain the title of the paper, full author name, =
affiliation and contact details and an abstract of up to 250 words.
Submissions will be reviewed by the members of the Doctoral Consortium =
Committee.

Accepted Papers
Students accepted to the Consortium will have the option of publishing a =
4-page extended abstract summarizing their research in the full ECIR =
conference proceedings.
