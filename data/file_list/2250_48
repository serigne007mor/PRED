*_FMEC 2020 CFP:_*

Cloud computing provides large range of services and virtually unlimited=20
available resources for users. New applications, such as virtual reality=20
and smart building control, have emerged due to the large number of=20
resources and services brought by cloud computing. However, the=20
delay-sensitive applications face the problem of large latency,=20
especially when several smart devices and objects are getting involved=20
in human=E2=80=99s life such as the case of smart cities or Internet of T=
hings.=20
Therefore, cloud computing is unable to meet the requirements of low=20
latency, location awareness, and mobility support. To solve this=20
problem, researchers have introduced a trusted and dependable solution=20
through the Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC) to put the services=20
and resources of the cloud closer to users, which facilitates the=20
leveraging of available services and resources in the edge networks. By=20
this, we are moving from the core (cloud data centers) to the edge of=20
the network closer to the users. FMEC dependability is based on=20
providing user centric service. The purpose of Fog and the Mobile Edge=20
Computing is to run the heavy real-time applications at the network edge=20
directly using the billions of connected mobile devices.

Several features enable the Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing to be a=20
perfect paradigm to the aforementioned purpose, which are the dense=20
geographical deployment of servers, supporting mobility and the=20
closeness to users. As in every new technology, some challenges face the=20
vision of the Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing, which are the=20
administrative policies and security concerns (i.e. secure data storage,=20
secure computation, network security, data privacy, usage privacy,=20
location privacy, etc).

FMEC 2020 conference aims to investigate the opportunities and=20
requirements for Mobile Edge Computing dominance. In addition, it seeks=20
for novel contributions that help mitigating Mobile Edge Computing=20
challenges. That is, the objective of FMEC 2020 is to provide a forum=20
for scientists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange new=20
ideas, novel results and experience on all aspects of Fog and Mobile=20
Edge Computing (FMEC). FMEC is Technically Co-Sponsored by IEEE France=20
Section.

Researchers are encouraged to submit original research contributions in=20
all major areas, which include, but not limited to:

* Mobile Cloud Computing Systems.
* FMEC Security and Privacy Issues.
* FMEC Pricing and billing models.
* FMEC support for VANETS and MANETS

*_Submissions Guidelines and Proceedings=C2=A0:_*

Manuscripts should be prepared in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5" x=20
11" two-column format. All papers should be in PDF format, and submitted=20
electronically at Paper Submission Link. A full paper can be up to 8=20
pages (including all figures, tables and references). Submitted papers=20
must present original unpublished research that is not currently under=20
review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these=20
guidelines may be rejected without review. Also submissions received=20
after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately=20
structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the Program=20
Chair for further information or clarification.

All submissions are peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted=20
papers will appear in the FMEC Proceeding, and be published by the IEEE=20
Computer Society Conference Publishing Services and be submitted to IEEE=20
Xplore for inclusion. Submitted papers must include original work, and=20
must not be under consideration for another conference or journal.=20
Submission of regular papers up to 8 pages and must follow the IEEE=20
paper format. Please include up to 7 keywords, complete postal and=20
e-mail address, and fax and phone numbers of the corresponding author.=20
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the=20
conference. Submitted papers that are deemed of good quality but that=20
could not be accepted as regular papers will be accepted as short=20
papers. Length of short papers can be between 4 to 6 pages.
