    Research Associate (Post-Doc or Pre-Doc)
    Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning
    Starting date: As soon as possible
    Employer and Location: LINA UMR CNRS - University of Nantes, France
    Duration: 12-15 months
    Deadline for Application: Open until filled
=====================================================

The LINA NLP Research Group [1] has an open position for a young 
researcher
(pre- or post-doc) starting as soon as possible.

The position is supported by the Unique Inter-ministerial
Fund (FUI) and available in the ODISAE project [2].
It aims at developing a semantic analyser of written online 
conversations
across several modalities (i.e. chat, forum, email).
Depending on the candidate profile, the subject can be oriented towards
one of the following directions: multilingual analysis, deeper analysis 
of
a specific modality, conversation structure recovering, conversation or
modality alignment.

Prerequisite is a PhD degree or a Master in computational linguistics,
computer science, or a related field. Candidates are expected to have
some knowledge of natural language processing and solid programming
skills. Knowledge of English is mandatory and prior experience in
machine learning or knowledge in discourse/dialogue analysis, text
alignment, or written online conversation analysis are a
plus. Knowledge of French is not a requirement.

The monthly gross salary will be 2,250-3,000 (EUR) depending on
qualifications (between 1,800 and 2,400 net income after tax).

About Nantes? Situated on the Loire River, close to the Atlantic coast,

city, and has a metropolitan area comprising some 600,000 inhabitants.
In 2004, Time Magazine named Nantes ‘the most liveable city in Europe’
and in 2013 it held the title of European Green Capital [4].

Please send applications (a single PDF file containing a motivation
letter, CV, list of publications and research statement) by email to
Nicolas Hernandez [3] (nicolas.hernandez@univ-nantes.fr).
Applications received by November 20, 2015 will receive full 
consideration.
