*Social network analysis and formal models of tagging activities to 
assist technology monitoring and other corporate intelligence activities*
Position type: Post-doctoral Fellow
Functional area: Sophia-Antipolis
Research theme: Cognitive systems
Project: EDELWEISS
 
*Environment*
Edelweiss research team at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis
http://www-sop.inria.fr/edelweiss/
 
*Mission*
The Edelweiss research team conducts research in the domain of 
graph-based knowledge representation and inference systems applied in 
particular to semantic web search engines and inference engines. The 
team is currently focusing its application field to technology watch, 
market intelligence and scientific monitoring using latest web 2.0 tools 
to assist these activities fostering expert networks and corporate 
social tagging. Unfortunately, on the one hand, Web 2.0 tools exhibit 
limits when it comes to automating tasks or controlling processes, as 
usually required in a corporate environment. And, on the other hand, 
more structured information systems often suffer from usability and 
knowledge capture issues. Thus a challenge of this post-doctoral subject 
is to reconcile viral new web applications with formal representations 
and in particular to study how to leverage the analysis of social graphs 
with their formal representation using ontologies to provide new 
functionalities in the information systems used for corporate intelligence.

More precisely, scientific challenges include:
(1) identify graph operators leveraging formal knowledge representations 
to detect structures and provide indicators relevant to intelligence 
analysis ( weak signal, communities of interest, renown experts, 
emerging fields, expert matching, network structures, etc.)
(2) identify and design functionalities leveraging these indicators to 
ease intelligence processes and respect corporate constraints (trust and 
privacy enforcement, targeted notification of events , network 
stimulation, assist the emergence of new communities)
(3) bridge social network, web tools data structures (blogs, wiki, 
bookmark, etc.) , tagging based indexing schemes and ontology-based 
knowledge bases, both in their representations and in the processing 
that could exploit the links between these structures (e.g. detect 
expertise combining graph-based social network analysis and 
linguistic-based tagging cloud clustering)
 
*Skills and profile*
The candidate will have to use semantic web formalisms, latest web 
standards and web 2.0 new tools and practices.
Knowledge in graph-based representations, graph processing and social 
network analysis would be interesting.
Knowledge in trust, reputation and privacy systems is also interesting.
Technologies used in the project include: JAVA J2EE, XML, RDF/S, OWL, 
SPARQL, RDFa, GRDDL.
The candidate must be fluent in at least one of these languages: 
English, French.
