    OVERVIEW

DAS 2022 is the 15th international IAPR-sponsored workshop dedicated 
towards system-level approaches and related challenges in document 
analysis and recognition. This includes models, methods, and relevant 
applications satisfying real-world engineering requirements. The 
workshop provides an exciting platform for interactions and high-level 
technical exchanges between industrial and academic communities. The DAS 
2022 program will include invited talks, oral and poster paper 
presentations, tutorials, demonstrations, and working group discussions.

DAS 2022 will be held in the historical city of La Rochelle located on 
the French Atlantic coast. La Rochelle is famous for its old port, 
stunning seaside views, urban beaches, and for the second largest 
private aquarium in Europe. Online/virtual participation will also be 
available for DAS 2022 authors and participants.

DAS 2022 will accept both full papers (up to 15 pages, presented orally 
or by poster) and short papers (up to 4 pages, presented as posters or 
demonstrations). All paper submissions will undergo a rigorous review 
process that will consider the originality, quality of work, and 
presentation of ideas, and relevance to document analysis system 
research. Springer will publish accepted full papers as part of the 
workshop’s LNCS proceedings, while short papers will be published 
separately in a companion booklet.

Full papers

Full papers should describe complete works of original research. Authors 
are invited to submit original unpublished research papers, up to 15 
pages length, that are not being considered in another forum. This 
restriction does not apply to unpublished technical reports or papers 
included in self-archive repositories (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) 
that are not peer-reviewed.

Short papers

Short papers provide an opportunity to report on research in progress, 
to present demos and novel positions on document analysis systems. 
Authors may submit short papers (up to 4 pages in length). Short papers 
will also undergo review and will appear in an extra booklet, not in the 
official DAS2022 proceedings.
