CfP: Workshop on Mining and Learning of Augmented Graphs=20
co-located with ECML PKDD 2014, September 15-19, 2014, Nancy, France

http://liris.cnrs.fr/malaga/


**** Aim and Scope: ****

Graphs are a powerful mathematical abstraction that enable to depict and st=
udy many real-word phenomena. Mining and learning graphs have been extensiv=
ely studied for than two decades. As a result, data mining and machine lear=
ning are now sufficiently mature to handle large graphs. With the rapid dev=
elopment of social media, sensor technologies and bioinformatic assay tools=
, real-world graph data has become ubiquitous. In practice, the simple grap=
h structure is not enough to catch all the complexity/diversity of phenomen=
a depicted by the graphs. Indeed, many pieces of information are often avai=
lable and can be used to produce augmented graphs such as multidimensional =
graphs, attributed graphs, dynamic graphs, multi-level graphs, 3D-graphs, e=
tc. It is a timely challenge to provide some data mining and machine learni=
ng methods to analyze such augmented graphs.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together pioneering researchers in the=
 fields of data mining and machine learning which are focusing in their res=
earch on the analysis of the non trivial aspects of augmented graphs. This =
workshop is a forum for exchanging ideas and methods for mining and learnin=
g of augmented graphs, developing new common understandings of the problems=
 at hand, sharing of data sets where applicable, and leveraging existing kn=
owledge from different disciplines. In doing so we aim to better understand=
 the overarching principles and the limitations of our current methods, and=
 to inspire research on new algorithms and techniques for mining and learni=
ng on augmented graphs.

Hence, the topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Theoretical aspects:
- Mining and learning in augmented graphs;
- Modeling and visualizing of augmented graphs;
- Constraint-based pattern mining in augmented graphs;
- Privacy preserving mining of augmented graphs;
- Data mining query languages for augmented graphs;
- Computational or statistical learning theory related to augmented graphs;
- Analysis of heterogeneous network;
- Analysis of attributed graphs;
- Analysis of multidimensional graphs;
- Analysis of 3D-graphs;
- Relationships between augmented graphs and statistical relational learnin=
g or inductive logic programming
- Analysis of complex systems;

Methods:
- Graph mining algorithms;
- Graphs kernel algorithms;
- Relational learning algorithms;
- Matrix/Tensor methods;
- Bayesian methods;
- Clustering/Co-clustering/Biclustering;
- Subspace clustering;
- Pattern mining with constraints;
- Subgroup discovery;
- Community detection;

Applications:
- Social networks;
- Social media;
- System biology;
- Sensor networks;

Our main goal is to stimulate discussion, collaboration and the sharing of =
experiences. In that respect, we have three submission types:

- unpublished works (max 15 pages, double submissions allowed). We allow a =
submitted or under review paper to also be submitted to the workshop. In th=
is way, we offer authors reviews and (if accepted) discussion on their work=
 among workshop participants.
- extended abstracts and vision statements (max 6 pages). Short papers and =
vision statements are meant to be thought provoking and stimulate discussio=
n.
- recently published works (special oral-only track, no page limits) Part o=
f the program will be for a short oral-only presentation of recently publis=
hed work. The aim is to share experiences and lessons learned

Submissions (except oral-only) should follow the LNCS formatting guidelines.

**** Key Dates: ****

Submission: Fri. 20 June.
Notification: Fri. 11 July.
Final version: Fri. 25 July.
Workshop: Fri. 19 Sept.
