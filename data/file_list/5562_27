*Position*: Machine Learning (Senior) Researcher
*Location*: TII, Abu Dhabi, UAE

Technology Innovation Institute (TII) is a global independent research and
development institute. Today, we are building a community of
multi-disciplinary scientists and researchers from across the globe,
transforming problems and roadblocks into pioneering research and
technology prototypes that help move society ahead.

At TII, we help society to overcome its biggest hurdles through a rigorous
approach to scientific discovery and inquiry, using state-of-the-art
facilities and collaboration with leading international institutions. Our
rigorous discovery and inquiry-based approach helps to forge new and
disruptive breakthroughs in advanced materials, autonomous robotics,
cryptography, cyber security, directed energy, quantum computing and secure
systems.

*Artificial Intelligence Cross-Center Unit *
The Artificial Intelligence Cross-Center Unit is the machine learning
powerhouse of TII, working in close collaboration with our other research
centers to harness the full benefits of AI across our projects =E2=80=93 an=

innovation from new computing paradigms, designing and delivering new AI
methodologies, technologies, solutions, and systems that address
challenging issues across multiple sectors of the economy =E2=80=93 from te=
chnology
to healthcare, cybersecurity, and government, among others.

We incorporate core elements of intelligence (perception, sensing,
planning, and language) in the ideation, design, and prototyping of
next-generation systems with human-like intelligence. We build advanced AI
computing and scalable AI-based software stacks and hardware systems to
deliver significant enhancements in systems infrastructure.

Our AI researchers, scientists, and engineers collaborate to ensure
innovative outcomes, from AI theory to AI technologies towards better
intelligence.

*Position: Machine Learning (Senior) Researcher*
The Connected Intelligence team of the AI Cross Unit explores cutting-edge
research problems as well as core ML infrastructure for distributed
learning on the edge. As a Senior ML Researcher, you will be a tech leader
and key contributor in building scalable and distributed ML infrastructure
and tools that solve real-life problems. You will work closely with team to
deliver new methods, core infrastructure, services, and optimizations. This
role is physically located in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

=E2=80=A2 Contribute to technology transfers through the implementation of =
the
research findings into proof of concept (PoC) according to the research
needs
=E2=80=A2 Participate in the development of distributed machine learning pl=
atforms
and open-source communities
=E2=80=A2 Collaborate with our partners internally and externally around th=
e world
to achieve the center=E2=80=99s goals
=E2=80=A2 Participate in or lead design reviews with peers and stakeholders=

dapt
content based on product/program updates and user feedback

*Qualifications*
To qualify for this position, you will need to meet the following
requirements:
=E2=80=A2 A PhD degree in machine learning or related field with at least 3=
 years=E2=80=99
experience post PhD
=E2=80=A2 Mature research skills in machine learning or distributed/federat=
ed
machine learning
=E2=80=A2 A good track record publications in top journals and conferences
=E2=80=A2 Experience in developing new algorithms or system-algorithm co-de=
sign for
federated or distributed learning
=E2=80=A2 Solve research challenges in the presence of real constraints, e.=
g.,
hardware/system heterogeneity, data volatility, communication constraints,
etc. in the context of distributed learning
=E2=80=A2 Have a good exposure to platforms like PyTorch and/or TensorFlow.
=E2=80=A2 An industry experience within the field of machine learning is
advantageous
