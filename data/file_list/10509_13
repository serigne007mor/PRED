Subject: [liste-egc] GIR'13

7th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval GIR'13 - First Call for Pa=
pers
----------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.geo.uzh.ch/~rsp/gir13/
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first call for papers for the 7th Workshop on Geographic Inform=
ation Retrieval (GIR'13), to be held on 5th November 2013 in conjunction wi=
th the ACM SIGSPATIAL 2013 conference in Orlando, Florida. The workshop con=
tinues the successful series of workshops held previously in cooperation wi=
th ACM SIGSPATIAL and in conjunction with SIGIR and CIKM conferences.=20

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together members of the vibrant and=
 growing community of researchers and practitioners working in the field of=
 geographic information retrieval to discuss current research activity and =
potential future research directions.=20

The subject and format of the workshop
There is a vast quantity of information in text documents and other media t=
hat is referenced to geographic space and which is the subject of informati=
on search. The discipline of Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) addre=
sses this information demand. It is concerned with the development of metho=
ds to gain access to geographically-specific information originating in uns=
tructured and semi-structured media such as text documents and images. The =
aim is thus to develop information systems that can automatically interpret=
 the geographical terminology and spatial concepts that people use when rec=
ording and querying the information and that can retrieve information that =
is relevant to the user=92s geographic information needs. GIR falls at the =
intersection of Information Retrieval (IR) and Geographical Information Sci=
ence and focuses particularly on research and systems development for purpo=
ses of geo-information extraction, spatio-textual information indexing and =
management and!
 spatially-oriented information retrieval.=20

The workshop invites contributions on the following topics:
=95	Detection, disambiguation and geocoding of geographical references in t=
ext;
=95	User needs for geographic search;
=95	Determination of the geographic focus of documents and media objects;
=95	Interpretation of spatial natural language in documents and queries;
=95	Extraction of geographically-specific facts from text;
=95	Spatial indexing of documents and other media objects and of their info=
rmation content;
=95	Reasoning with and integration of structured geo-spatial facts for purp=
oses of information retrieval;
=95	Geo-spatial ontologies, gazetteers and geographic thesauri;
=95	Geographical query interfaces for search on the web;
=95	Geographic question / answering systems;
=95	Geographic search engine architectures;
=95	Relevance ranking of geographical information;
=95	Evaluation methods for geographic search.
We invite the submission of articles of up to 8 pages for presentation as l=
ong papers and 2 page short abstracts, reporting on work in progress, for s=
hort presentations. All submissions will be reviewed by three members of th=
e programme committee, and all accepted papers will be published in the ACM=
 Digital Library.=20

Please note that we welcome contributions both from academic researchers an=
d from practitioners working in industry and in public agencies engaged in =
GIR-related activities.=20

The workshop programme will ensure opportunity for discussion of the presen=
ted papers. It will also include a panel session to discuss the future agen=
da for research in GIR. It is intended that this latter session, and the wo=
rkshop as a whole, will facilitate the initiation of collaborative research=
 proposals from the participants in the workshop.=20

Submission procedure
You should prepare your abstract in accordance with the ACM camera-ready in=
structions (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) and=
 submit it using the EasyChair system (http://www.easychair.org/conferences=
/?conf=3Dgir13) by 16th August 2013. Decisions on acceptance will be announ=
ced by 6th September 2013.=20=20

At least one author of accepted papers will be required to register for the=
 workshop in order to present the paper.
Please note that attendance at the workshop will require registration for t=
he main ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS conference (http://sigspatial2013.sigspatial.org=
/) in addition to registering for the workshop.=20
