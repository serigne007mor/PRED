OVERVIEW
-------

   Information Systems are repositories where sensitive and crucial data are recorded to support day-to-day company applications and decision making processes. Therefore, these systems often contain most of company product and process knowledge. Unfortunately, this knowledge is implicitly encoded using company specific models. Thus, developing new user interfaces or reconciling data with external ones often require some kind of reverse engineering 
processes for making data semantic explicit. 
   
   Nowadays, ontologies are used for making explicit the meaning of information in several research and application domains. Initiated in Artificial Intelligence, ontologies are now used in a large spectrum of fields such as: Semantic Web, information integration, database design, e-Business, data warehousing, data mining. They are also used to provide information 
system user knowledge-level interfaces. Over the last five year, a number of interactions between ontologies and information systems have emerged. New methods have been proposed to embed within database both ontologies and data, defining new ontology-based database. New languages were developed in order to facilitate exchange both ontology and data. Other languages dedicated for querying data at the ontological level were proposed (e.g., RQL or OntOQL). Various approaches have been designed to deal with semantic integration 
of heterogeneous information sources using ontologies either in data sources or in mediators. In some domains, like products modelling, ontologies were published as standards. 

These ontologies are actually used to define world wide exchange consortiums for sharing information in various application domains. Due to these recent developments, most commercial database systems offer solution to both manage ontologies and data. 
   
   The aim of this special issue of the Data & Knowledge Engineering Journal is twofold. 
The first one is to present new and challenging issues in the contribution of ontologies for designing high quality information systems. The second one is to present new research and technological developments that use ontologies all over the life cycle of information systems.
