Springer Image and Vision Computing - Special Issue on Event-based Media Pr=
ocessing and Analysis

http://www.journals.elsevier.com/image-and-vision-computing/call-for-papers=
/special-issue-on-event-based-media-processing-and-analysis


People collect dozens of photos and video clips with their smartphones, tab=
lets, cameras, and such information is exchanged in a number of different w=
ays. The growing number of sensors for capturing environmental conditions i=
n the moment of content creation enriches data with context-awareness that =
allows capturing experiences and events of interest from a very rich person=
al perspective. This unveils an enormous potential for event-centred data a=
nalysis. The key idea is to use events as primary means for understanding, =
organizing and index content (e.g., photos, videos, news). Events have the =
ability to semantically encode relationships of different informational mod=
alities. These modalities can include, but are not limited to: time, space,=
 involved agents and objects, with the spatio-temporal component of events =
being a key feature for contextual analysis.

A variety of techniques have recently been presented to leverage contextual=
 information for event-based analysis. Content-based only approaches have e=
xhibited several limitations in the field of event analysis, especially for=
 the event detection task. However, vision-based media analysis is importan=
t for object detection and recognition and can therefore play a significant=
 role, which is complementary to that of event-driven context recognition.

The aim of this special issue is soliciting novel contributions in various =
aspects of event-based processing and analysis, with an emphasis on vision-=
based approaches taking also into account additional event-related contextu=
al information. The convergence of aforementioned event analysis components=
, wrapped by appropriate state of the art human-computer interaction (HCI) =
technology can result to innovative applications useful in various sectors.

Both theoretical contributions and interesting applications validated on la=
rge-scale datasets are welcome. For the proposed methodologies, the authors=
 are encouraged to provide quantitative comparison and performance evaluati=
on.

About the issue

The topics of this special issue include, but are not limited to:

Methodology:

  *   Low-level activity and event detection from multimedia content;
  *   Semantic event representations;
  *   Event modelling and representation;
  *   Event processing and aggregation;
  *   Understanding scene and objects' role in events;
  *   Understanding human interaction in events;
  *   Semantic content and context analysis for the detection and recogniti=
on of events within multimedia streams;
  *   HCI techniques for event detection, recognition and exploitation;
  *   Multiple views and multiple user event analysis;
  *   RGBD-based event analysis;
  *   Synchronization of event media;
  *   Large-scale visual analysis for social media event detection.

Applications:

  *   Interactive event-based applications and tools;
  *   (Collaborative) authoring of events;
  *   Events in mobile computing and ubiquitous computing;
  *   Applications that show benefits of using events in practical settings;
  *   User experience, requirements, use cases, and evaluations of event-ba=
sed applications.

Submission format

Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, presentation, relevanc=
e and contribution to the field, as well as their suitability to this speci=
al issue, and for their overall quality. The submitted papers must be writt=
en in excellent English and describe original research which has not been p=
ublished nor currently under review by other journals or conferences. Previ=
ously published conference papers should be clearly identified by the autho=
rs (at the submission stage) and an explanation should be provided how such=
 papers have been extended to be considered for this special issue. Guest e=
ditors will make an initial determination of the suitability and scope of a=
ll submissions. Papers that either lack originality, clarity in presentatio=
n or fall outside the scope of the special issue will not be sent for revie=
w and the authors will be promptly informed in such cases. To encourage rep=
roducible research, preference will be given to submissions accompanied by =
software that generates the results claimed in the manuscript.

Important dates

  *   Initial Paper Submission: January 15, 2015
  *   First Round Decisions: April 15, 2015
  *   Revisions Deadline: June 30, 2015
  *   Final Round Decisions: September 30, 2015
