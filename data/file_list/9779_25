Subject: [liste-egc] STAIRS 2012 Call for Papers

 The Sixth "Starting Artificial Intelligence Research" Symposium

 August, 27-28, 2012
 Montpellier, France
 http://www.lirmm.fr/ecai2012

 We invite students and young post-doctoral AI fellows to submit their
 work to the Sixth European Starting AI Researcher Symposium (STAIRS).
 STAIRS is an international meeting intended to support AI researchers,
 from all countries, at the beginning of their career: PhD  students or
 people holding a PhD for less than one year. STAIRS 2012 will be
 co-located  with ECAI 2012, the European Conference on AI, in
 Montpellier, France,  August 27-31, 2012.

 STAIRS offers doctoral students and young post-doctoral AI researchers:

 * a first experience on submitting and presenting a paper in an
 international forum with a broad scope and a peer review process

 * an opportunity to discuss and explore their research interests and
 European career objectives and opportunities.

 Co-located with both ECAI and PAIS, the symposium provides a unique and
 valuable opportunity for young researchers to gain experience at
 presenting their work in a supportive scientific environment, and 
 obtain
 constructive feedback on the technical content of the work as well as
 how to present the work and other related topics. Specifically,

 the objectives are: (1) to provide a setting for mutual feedback on
 participants' current research; (2) to provide guidance on future
 research  directions; (3) to develop a supportive community of scholars
 and a spirit of  collaborative research; (4) to support a new 
 generation
 of researchers with  information and advice on academic, research,
 industrial, and non-traditional  career paths; and (5) to contribute to
 the conference goals through interaction  with other researchers and
 participation in ECAI/PAIS/STAIRS conference events.


 (+) Topics on Interest

 Papers are welcome on all aspects of contemporary AI, including, but 
 not
 restricted to:

 * Agent-based&  Multiagent Systems
 * Case-Based Reasoning
 * Cognitive Modeling&  Interaction
 * Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search
 * Information Retrieval&  Natural Language Processing
 * Knowledge Representation, Reasoning,&  Logic
 * Machine Learning&  Data Mining
 * Model-Based Reasoning
 * Multidisciplinary Topics&  Applications of AI
 * Planning, Scheduling,&  Auctions
 * Robotics, Perception&  Sensing
 * Statistical Relational AI&  Uncertainty in AI
 * Web and Knowledge-based Information Systems

 (+) Important Dates

 Paper submission deadline:
 Friday, May 25, 2012

 Notification of acceptance/rejection:
 Monday, June, 23 2012

 Camera-Ready Copy Due:
 Sunday, June 30, 2012

 Conference:
 August 27-28, 2012

 (+) Submission

 Both long (12-page) and short (6-page) papers in camery-ready format
 can be submitted. Over-length submissions will be rejected without
 review.  Papers submitted to STAIRS should conform to presentational
 style and format of IOS Press' "Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence 
 and
 Applications" (FAIA) series. Details are available on the web site

 http://www.iospress.nl/service/authors/latex-and-word-tools-for-book-authors/

 Each accepted long paper will be allocated TWELVE (12) pages, each 
 short
 paper  SIX (6) pages in the proceedings. From the accepted long papers,
 both oral and  poster presentations will be selected. Accepted short
 papers will be poster  presentations. Authors of ECAI submission may
 also indicate whether they want  a submitted ECAI paper to be
 considered  as well as a submitted STAIRS paper  in case of
 non-acceptance of the ECAI paper. This, however, will require to change
 the format for the camera-ready copy. In contrast to ECAI,  STAIRS is
 using IOS Press' FAIA series format as explained above!

 So, multiple submissions with ECAI and PAIS are allowed if this is
 clearly indicated on a front page preceding the paper itself. In
 borderline cases single submissions will be preferred over multiple
 submissions.  In case of multiple acceptances the author(s) are 
 strictly
 required to withdraw their paper from all but one of the events.

 The proceedings of STAIRS will be published and distributed by

    IOS Press' "Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications"

 (FAIA) series. The authors will be responsible for producing
 camera-ready copies  of papers, conforming to the STAIRS 2012 
 formatting
 guidelines for inclusion  in the proceedings (see above). At least one
 student author of each accepted  paper or poster is required to attend
 the conference to present the contribution.

 All submissions will be subject to LIGHT TOUCH review, with the goal  
 of
 providing constructive feedback to authors.

 IMPORTANT NOTE: The first author must be a PhD student or a person
 holding  a PhD for less than one year. Papers not satisfying this
 criterion will be rejected.
