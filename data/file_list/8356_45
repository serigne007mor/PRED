1st PhD position: Learning representations of 3D data and temporal data

The overall goal of the first PhD position on "learning representations of =
3D data and temporal data" is to investigate innovative approaches based on=
 computer vision techniques and machine learning, but also explore the use =
of multiple cues, in particular geometric cues and visual cues.

Hand-designed features such as SIFT and HOG underpin many successful object=
 recognition approaches. However, these only capture low-level edge informa=
tion and it has proven difficult to design features that effectively captur=
e mid-level cues (e.g. edge intersections) or high-level representation (e.=
g. object parts). Recent developments in machine learning, known as Deep Le=
arning, have shown how hierarchies of features can be learned in an unsuper=
vised manner directly from data.

This PhD will start by studying how to learn features, rather than hand-cra=
ft them. It will then study several basic architectures, exploring how they=
 learn features, and analysing how they can be "stacked" into hierarchies t=
hat can extract multiple layers of representation. The proposed PhD will ta=
ckle the problem of creating structured models for weakly structured data, =
e.g. video, where the application of traditional unstructured learning mach=
ines is unsuccessful. In particular, in the targeted situations, motion pre=
sent in the data may be vehicles related motion, motion related to interact=
ions between vehicles (relatively to traffic conditions) or irrelevant moti=
on. In these cases, scene representation based on low level features alone =
is not efficient and context needs to be taken into account. This may typic=
ally involve relationships between vehicles (e.g. exploring how multi-level=
 depth, geometric cues, and high-level representation could be fused), extr=
action and injection of scene type information, information on the state of=
 the environment, and others.

Given these requirements, the integration of various types of features at v=
arious levels seems a promising idea. In particular, the PhD will address s=
everal sub-problems: Feature extraction =E2=80=93 the proposed work will fo=
cus on depth information (e.g. depth from still image) and temporal informa=
tion (e.g. depth from motion, structure from trajectories) extracted from v=
ideo. Depth information allows the inclusion of precise geometrical informa=
tion into the representation process, either through depth features extract=
ed from objects or through 3D reconstruction. The automatic learning of fea=
ture extractors through deep learning has been investigated very recently. =
However, the application of deep learning to complex problems involving str=
uctured model is still an open problem. Structuring =E2=80=93 structuring t=
he features will allow to make the representation robust to occlusions, cha=
nges in viewpoint, and most importantly, to deal with large photometric var=
iations. The learning of hierarchical representations of scene structure wi=
ll be investigated The model and algorithms developed in this PhD will be t=
ested on new datasets, as the Kitti dataset.

The ideal PhD student should hold a Master degree in pattern recognition, c=
omputer vision, or related fields. She/he should have a background in artif=
icial intelligence, statistics or applied mathematics, optimization, linear=
 algebra.

The applicant should also have strong programming skills and be familiar wi=
th MATLAB, C/C++, OpenGL.

2nd PhD position: New Theoretical Frameworks in Metric Learning: Applicatio=
n to Energy Management

This proposal is a fundamental research project whose main goal is to provi=
de new theoretical frameworks and algorithms for automatically learning met=
rics from data. Based on the saying "Birds of a feather flock together", me=
trics play a crucial role in a large set of learning methods, such as the w=
idely used k-nearest neighbors, kernel-based methods in classification or t=
he k-Means algorithm in clustering.
Since manually tuning metrics for a given real-world problem is often diffi=
cult and tedious, our objective is to automatically acquire knowledge from =
training data to optimize good metrics. This requires to formally define th=
e notion of goodness that would allow us to ensure theoretical guarantees (=
i) on the generalization ability of the metric (i.e. do the properties opti=
mized over the training set still hold on new data?) and (ii) on the genera=
lization capability of a classifier using that metric (i.e. can we derive u=
pper bounds on the generalization error of the classifier?). The metric lea=
rning algorithms developed in this project will be used to deal with an app=
lication in energy management in collaboration with Schneider Electric.

This proposal has three main scientific objectives:
- Derive theoretical guarantees both on the quality of the metric and on th=
e performance of the classifier making use of the metric.
- Deal with heterogeneous and complex data (structured data, times series).
- Design new algorithms to deal with various settings (constraints inducing=
 sparsity, multiclass problems, online learning).

The ideal PhD applicant should hold a master degree in computer science wit=
h good skills in machine learning, pattern recognition and statistical lear=
ning. The candidate must be highly motivated, havegood english communicatio=
n skills and be interested in both theoretical and practical aspects.

3rd PhD position: Metric Learning and Domain adaptation

This PhD has for objective to propose new metric learning algorithms for do=
main adaptation problems.
The problem of domain adaptation arises when training data and test data co=
me from different distributions. Many application areas are indeed concerne=
d by this setting. For example, in computer vision, many classifiers able t=
o recognize objects in an image are trained from a given source domain. How=
ever, when they are applied on another testdomain they often show a signifi=
cant loss of accuracy. This can be explained by the influence of many facto=
rs like the imaging devices or the luminance. From a statistical learning p=
oint a view, the objective is then to learn accurate classifiers robust to =
mismatched distributions. In this context, existing theoretical frameworks =
show, by means of generalization bounds, that a good model on the test doma=
in can be obtained by moving closer training and testing distributions whil=
e keeping a good accuracy on the training data. Many methods have been prop=
osed in the literature for this problem and in this PhD thesis we propose t=
o tackle it by metric learning approaches. Metrics play a crucial role in l=
arge set of supervised or unsupervised learning methods. A current trend in=
the machine learning community is to improve these metrics by using optimiz=
ation-based methods. The general idea is to project the learning data in a =
new metric space where some proximity constraints (given by an expert or ca=
ptured from the learning sample) have to be fulfilled. In this PhD, the goa=
l is to make use of these methods to improve domain adaptation algorithms. =
From a theoretical standpoint, the scientific question we aim at studying i=
s the following: Can we establish a relationship between the quality of a m=
etric induced by a metric learning algorithm and the generalization ability=
 of a domain adaptation algorithm?

This proposal has three main objectives:
- Define a new metric learning framework for domain adaptation (single task=
 and multi-tasks)
- Derive new algorithms standing in this framework
- Evaluate proposed the models on computer vision/image processing
tasks (e.g. classification, segmentation, ...).


The ideal PhD applicant should hold a master degree in computer science wit=
h good skills in machine learning, pattern recognition and statistical lear=
ning. Some knowledge in computer vision, image processing or multimedia wou=
ld be a plus, but it is not required. The candidate must be highly motivate=
d, have good english communication skills and be interested in both theoret=
ical and practical aspects.
