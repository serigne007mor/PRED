Graph mining for text analysis : using graph pattern structures and subgrap=
h mining

One major problem in knowledge discovery is posed by the very large number =
of patterns (itemsets, association rules) that is returned by pattern minin=
g algorithms. This is particularly true for texts or graphs. It is then qui=
te impossible for an expert to analyse the results of the mining process. T=
here are some ways of lowering the complexity of the mining task. One is to=
 set up a high frequency support but this is usually not appropriate as ver=
y frequent patterns are not the most interesting ones and many interesting =
less frequent patterns are missed. Another idea is to use appropriate const=
raints or measures for filtering the extracted patterns. Among these measur=
es, we would like to consider and to extend the notion of =93most informati=
ve pattern=94 resulting from a previous work on the mining of molecular str=
uctures.

The interesting patterns are those which are =93discriminant=94 in the sens=
e that they are able to represent a large family of patterns (factorization=
, internal cohesion) and this family is well separated from other families =
(discrimination, external separation). The notion of most informative patte=
rn is well adapted to this discrimination task. The search for most informa=
tive pattern can be considered as an optimisation problem where the pattern=
s showing the best compromise between frequency and information rate in the=
ir description. A measure of this compromise can be estimated by a score fu=
nction. In the present case, given a collection of texts, the problem is to=
 search for the graph patterns which show the highest measure.

The most informative patterns were introduced for guiding subgraph mining. =
In this thesis subject, an idea is to extend this previous work to natural =
language processing and text analysis based on subgraph mining techniques. =
Graphs are powerfull tools for representing texts both on structural aspect=
s and on semantic ones. The problem of extracting most informative pat- ter=
ns consists in searching for the patterns whose score is maximal. One examp=
le of score function is given by the area function involving frequency and =
length of the patterns. A property of a score function is to be increasing =
w.r.t. all its variables (following the pattern order). In the present proj=
ect, there is a need to design an adapted score function that in addition t=
akes into account domain knowledge and as well linguistic relevant elements.

Based on the collection of subgraph patterns that can be extracted from a c=
ollection of text using the most informative pattern approach, the next ide=
a is to extend the pattern structure approach in FCA to subgraph. In this w=
ay, a classification of texts w.r.t. the graph representation of their cont=
ent, will be available as a concept lattice. This concept lattice can be us=
ed for a number of tasks, such as information retrieval, but also for ontol=
ogy engineering. For achieving the classification task, it is necessary to =
adapt and extend previous work on pattern structures.
Finally, this thesis subject tries to bridge two mining approaches, sub- gr=
aph mining in the one hand and FCA in the other hand. Each of these approac=
h has powerful characteristics and it is worth trying to take advantage of =
the strength of both methods for completing and enriching each of the metho=
ds.


Applications are opened now and should include the following:
- Cover letter outlining interest in the position and academic goals
- Complete CV
- Copies of certificates and marks sheets
- Copy of the MA thesis and other publications.
- Name  (and status) of 2 referees for a letter of recommandation
