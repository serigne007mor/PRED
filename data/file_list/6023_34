<http://icwe2021.webengineering.org/>


IMPORTANT DATES

* Abstract submission: January 4, 2021 (23h59 Hawaii Time)
* Full paper submission: January 11, 2021 (23h59 Hawaii Time)
* Paper notification: February 15, 2021 (23h59 Hawaii Time)

ICWE 2021 AT A GLANCE

The International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE) is the premier =
annual conference on Web Engineering and associated technologies. ICWE =
aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various =
disciplines in academia and industry to tackle the emerging challenges =
in: 1) the engineering of Web applications, 2) the problems of its =
associated technologies, and 3) the impact of those technologies on =
society and culture. The 21st edition of ICWE will accept contributions =
on a wide spectrum of topics related to Web Engineering, such as, among =
others:

* Web application modelling and engineering
* Web mining and knowledge extraction
* Web Big Data and Web data analytics
* Mobile Web applications
* Web of Things applications
* Social Web applications
* Web crowdsourcing and human computation
* Semantic Web, Web ontologies, and Linked Open Data applications
* Quality and accessibility aspects of Web applications
* Web composition and mashups
* Web user interfaces
* Web security and privacy
* Web programming
* Web services, computing, and standards

In addition to the research track, ICWE 2021 also seeks contributions of =
demos and posters, student papers to the PhD Symposium, tutorials, and =
workshops, which will be subject of individual calls.

The conference will be held at Le Bellevue congress centre in Biarritz, =
France. Biarritz is an elegant seaside town, with long sandy beaches, =
known as the resort of the kings, easily reachable by car, train, and =
plane. Further information can be found at =

* Full papers: mature, original research contribution. Reported results =
should be supported by some type of validation, and also include a =
justification about the choice/suitability of the validation method. In =
addition, evidence of use in practice and/or demonstration of =
scalability is regarded as a plus. (15 pages)

* Short papers: short papers presenting a discussion =E2=80=93 analysis, =
criticism, proposal, etc. =E2=80=93 about relevant aspects of Web =
engineering topics. These papers are intended to generate discussions =
that promise potential for research that will impact Web engineering in =
the coming years. (8 pages)

Papers must be formatted according to the information for Springer LNCS =
authors at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html =
<http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html> and submitted in PDF. =
Papers submitted to ICWE 2021 must not be under review elsewhere while =
under consideration for ICWE 2021, nor may have been already previously =
published elsewhere. Submissions that are not in compliance with the =
required submission format or that are out of the scope of the =
conference will be desk rejected without reviewing.

Accepted contributions will be included into the ICWE 2021 Springer LNCS =
proceedings. The best papers will be selected to be proposed, in =
extended form, as part of a special issue of the Journal of Web =
Engineering.=20
Authors should consult Springer=E2=80=99s authors=E2=80=99 guidelines =
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for =
the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include =
their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of =
each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must =
complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the copyright =
for their paper is transferred to Springer.
