Dear Colleagues,

Please consider to contribute to and/or forward to the appropriate =
groups the following opportunity to submit and publish original =
scientific results to this special session.=20
The paper submission deadline is Aug 10, 2020.

Regards,

Call for Papers=20

The Intelligent Internet of Things and Applications =E2=80=9CAIOT =
2021=E2=80=9D  https://aiot2021.sigappfr.org/) from the International =
Semantic Intelligence Conference (ISIC 2021) =
(https://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/isic/) will take place on 25-27 =
February,2021 in New Delhi, India. This Special Issue aims to =
demonstrate the indispensable role of business data and methodological =
know-how in helping decision-making and how to use and exploit the prior =
knowledge to enhance data analytic for autonomous decision-making. We =
hence encourage original paper submissions, which have not been =
published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and =
industry presenting novel research addressing the aforementioned =
challenges.=20

Aim and scope=20

Artificial Intelligence & Internet of Things (IoT) are the latest =
trending technology making society-changing in many fields especially in =
industries like Manufacturing, Automation, Healthcare, Energy, =
Transport, Defence, Space, Data Mining, Elder Care etc. AI & IoT, are =
opening a wide set of new opportunities, both for novel =
services/applications and increased efficiency/scalability. These =
opportunities include locally sharing information, collaborating, =
generating/consuming a huge amount of data and learning from a massive =
amount of data in real time to quickly identify newly emerging unknown =
patterns. Indeed, distributed big data analytics, modern Machine =
Learning (ML) technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), real-time data =
collection and processing, scalable and distributed security solutions =
such as blockchain, and distributed secure data processing, may play a =
significant role. However, successful decision-making needs to combine =
the best qualities of both human and digital knowledge. To do so, it is =
capital to structure any type of relevant and reliable knowledge and =
incorporate it as part of decision analytics Indeed, there is an =
increasing recognition of utilizing knowledge whenever available or can =
be created purposefully. This includes contextual and organizational =
information that analytics by itself does not provide.=20

Special session topics=20

We are seeking both conceptual and empirical papers offering new =
insights and contribution to the development of data analytic algorithms =
and systems for autonomous decision-making, which focus on the following =
topics (but are not limited to) which demonstrate the role of exploiting =
the knowledge to enhance data analytics:
=E2=80=A2 Enhancing the capability in handling uncertainty;
=E2=80=A2 Enhancing transparency, interpretability and explainability;
=E2=80=A2 Reducing the complexity of model architecture in time and =
space;
=E2=80=A2 Enhancing the capability to avoid social discrimination and =
unfair treatment;
=E2=80=A2 Enhancing automated decision making capability and =
performance;
=E2=80=A2 Enhancing reliability and integrity of data analytics.

Session Proceedings:

Session proceedings will be published by Springer.
Important dates:
- Paper Submission Deadline: Aug 10, 2020
- Paper Notification: Sep 20, 2020
