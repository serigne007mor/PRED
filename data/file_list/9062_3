================================================================ 

The European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS) is the premier 
conference on the advances in the state of the art and practice 
of Web services. The main objectives of this conference are to 
facilitate the exchange between researchers and practitioners 
and to foster future collaborations in Europe and beyond. 
The ECOWS 2011 conference will include invited speakers, 
presentations of contributed research papers and an industrial 
track with the participation of top researchers from industry. 
ECOWS 2011 will also include a PhD symposium and satellite 
workshops. 

---------- 
Background 
---------- 
The success encountered by the Web has shown that tightly 
coupled software systems are only good for niche markets, 
whereas loosely coupled software systems can be more flexible, 
more adaptive and often more appropriate in practice. Loose 
coupling makes it easier for a given system to interact with 
other systems, possibly legacy systems that share very little 
with it. Web services are at the crossing of distributed 
computing and loosely coupled systems. When applications are 
developed with service-oriented architectures, they can evolve 
more easily during their lifespan and adapt better to changing 
or even unpredictable environments. Services today can be 
implemented such that they are discovered and invoked 
dynamically using non-proprietary mechanisms. Such services 
are developed and deployed in a black-box manner. This is of 
particular importance from a business perspective since 
services are implemented in a variety of technologies. 
Essential is agreement on integration technology and consensus 
has emerged in today's middleware market: Customers want 
to use Web technologies. Despite these promises, however, 
service integrators, developers, and providers need to create 
methods, tools and techniques to support cost-effective 
development and use of dependable services and service-oriented 
applications. 

------------------ 
Topics of interest 
------------------ 
The ECOWS 2011 program committee seeks original, high quality 
papers related to all aspects of Web Services, which constitute 
the main technology available to date for implementing 
service-oriented architectures and computing. 

Topics of interest to the Research and Industry Tracks include, 
but are not limited to, the following: 

- Business Process Management and Web Services 
- Cloud Services Management and Composition using Web Services 
- Dynamic and Adaptive Web Services 
- Economics Models and Web Services 
- Enterprise Architecture and Web Services 
- Emerging Trends of Service Composition and Mashups 
- Experience reports of novel applications of Web Services in 
Health, Commerce, Finance, Telecom, Scientific Computing and 
other domains 
- Service modeling, service-oriented analysis and design 
- Formal Methods for Web Services 
- Frameworks for Building Web Service-Based Applications 
- Identity and Access Management using Web Services 
- Mobile Web Services 
- Model-Driven Web Service Engineering 
- Next Generation Web Services Middleware and Service Repositories 
- Service quality and service interface design guidelines 
- RESTful Web Services 
- Self-Organizing Service Oriented Architectures 
- Semantic Web Services 
- Service Level Agreements for Web services 
- Service-Oriented Business Collaboration 
- SOA Governance and Web Services 
- Social Web Services 
- Web Services for Grids 
- Web Services in Service-Oriented Environments 
- Web Services Life-Cycles 
- Web Services Security and Privacy 

It should be noted that papers on existing product descriptions 
or product marketing information are not within the scope of the 
ECOWS 2011 Industrial Track.

PhD Symposium 
------------- 
The ECOWS 2011 PhD Symposium is an international forum for PhD 
students working in any of the areas addressed by the ECOWS 
conference. The main aim of the Symposium is to give PhD 
students an opportunity to present their research activity and 
perspectives, to critically discuss them with other PhD students 
and with established researchers in the area, and to get fruitful 
feedback and advices on their research activity. 

PhD students working in any area addressed by the ECOWS 
conference can submit a short report providing a clear statement 
of the problem they intend to address, motivating the interest 
and novelty of the underlying research challenges, demonstrating 
the ideas by examples, and describing the proposed research plan 
and expected results. Reports should not exceed 6 pages formatted 
according to the IEEE proceedings guidelines. The papers should 
be authored by the PhD student and indicate the name of her/his 
supervisor. Submissions must be sent by email to the symposium 
chair Wolf Zimmermann ( wolf.zimmermann@informatik.uni-halle.de ). 

--------------------- 
Submission Guidelines 
--------------------- 
Original papers, not submitted for publication elsewhere, can be 
submitted via EasyChair.
