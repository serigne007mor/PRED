Summary

Fuzzy methods are in common use nowadays, as they provide tools to
handle data sets in a relevant, robust and interpretable way. Yet they
often suffer from the perception that they cannot address huge data
bases, although it is not the case, as many applications, including
industrial success stories, have shown: fuzziness and scalability are
not antagonistic concepts.
The scalability issue indeed appears to be challenging when considering
fuzzy methods as opposed to crisp ones, which is a counterpart to their
improved flexibility and expression power. The application of fuzzy
methods to huge data bases is often considered as inappropriate.
This issue has received attention from the research community and many
methods have been proposed to address it from several points of view,
including implementation of data structures and algorithmic approaches
to handle complexity. The goal of the workshop is to review these
scalable fuzzy methods and the up-to-date methods and algorithms that
address this problem, showing that fuzzy logic is a very powerful
approach to provide relevant results also for very large data bases
within reasonable time and memory use.
The workshop will cover a wide scope of research areas where large data
bases are queried, ranging from fuzzy data bases to fuzzy data mining
and fuzzy control, and considering data bases of various types,
including relational data, image, video or multimedia data as well as
web data.


Topics include, but are not limited to

Managing, Querying and Mining Very Large Fuzzy Databases
Fuzzy Mining in Very Large Databases
Fuzzy Stream Mining
Fuzzy Machine Learning
Fuzzy Information Retrieval
Fuzzy Semantic Web
Fuzzy Control
Fuzzy Logic and New Paradigms of Programming
