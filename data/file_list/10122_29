Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: 4th International ACM Conference on Management of
 Emergent Digital EcoSystems (MEDES'12) - Ethiopia

------ sorry for cross-posting --------

 The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSyst=
ems (MEDES 2012)
                         In-Cooperation with ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
                                http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES/12/
                                    October 28-31, 2012
                                   Addis Ababa, Ethiopia


Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet, the rapid growth and exponential use of digit=
al medias leads to the emergence of virtual environments namely digital eco=
systems composed of multiple and independent entities such as individuals, =
organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several m=
issions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them=
. The digital ecosystem exhibits self-organizing environments, thanks to th=
e re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", in which resour=
ces provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The u=
nderlying resources mainly comprehend data management, innovative services,=
 computational intelligence and self-organizing platforms. Due to the multi=
-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems and their characteristics, they =
are highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understan=
ding as to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be inn=
ovative and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies has=
 the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resource=
s and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting bu=
siness practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved through =
novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as data manageme=
nt, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, ar=
tificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support th=
e establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSyste=
ms (MEDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from acad=
emia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifo=
ld challenges and issues related to resource management of Digital Ecosyste=
ms and how current approaches and technologies can be
evolved and adapted to this end. The conference seeks related original rese=
arch papers, industrial papers and proposals for demonstrations.


Topics
-------
In this call, we solicit original research and technical papers not publish=
ed elsewhere. The papers can be theoretical, practical and application orie=
nted on the following themes (but not limited to):

- Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
- Green computing
- Emergent Intelligence
- Services
- Trust, Security & Privacy
- Data & Knowledge Management
- Web and Standards
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Networks and Protocols
- Open Source
- Miscellaneous


Paper Submission
----------------
Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website.
The submitted paper should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Pap=
ers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected. Submissions wil=
l be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary noti=
fication date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiri=
es and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify aut=
hors with the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, s=
ignificance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of prese=
ntation.
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging pos=
itions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At least=
 one author should attend the conference to present the paper.

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP.
