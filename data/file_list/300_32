**********************************************************************
6th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing (ICSOC'08)
Sydney, Australia, December 1-5, 2008

http://icsoc.org/

Abstract submission: June 1, 2008 11:59pm, PST
Paper submission: June 8, 2008 11:59pm, PST
**********************************************************************


CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS
--------------------------
Service oriented computing is an emerging cross-disciplinary paradigm 
for distributed computing that is changing the way software applications 
are designed, architected, delivered and consumed.

ICSOC’08 builds on the success of previous conferences in this series, 
establishing bridges between established and new service research and 
applications communities and fostering cross-community scientific 
excellence. Our goal is to bring together ideas and technologies from 
many different fields in an evolutionary manner, to address research 
challenges such as service composition, discovery, integration, 
monitoring and management of services, service quality and security, 
methodologies for supporting service development, governance in their 
evolution, as well as their overall life-cycle management. This year, we 
are focusing on building bridges with the business community because of 
its ongoing contribution to the emerging field of Services Science.

ICSOC’08 seeks original papers in the field of service oriented 
computing, from theoretical and foundational results to empirical 
evaluations as well as practical and industrial experiences, with the 
emphasis on results that contribute to solving the many still open 
research problems that are of significant importance to the field of 
service oriented applications. Topics include but are not limited to the 
following:

- Services Foundations
- Business Service Modelling
- Integrating Systems of Systems using Services
- Service Engineering
- Service Assembly
- Service Management
- SOA Runtime
- Quality of Service
- Service Applications (Grid, E-science, Government, etc.)
- Business and Economical Aspects of Services

CALL FOR INDUSTRIAL PAPERS
------------------------------
ICSOC 2008 solicits submissions covering the state of practice and 
real-world experience in service-oriented computing, including papers 
that describe innovative service-based implementations, novel 
applications of service-oriented technology, and insights and 
improvements to the state-of-practice. Case studies from practitioners 
emphasizing applications, service technology, system deployment, 
organizational ramifications, or business impact are especially welcome.

The industrial track focuses on real world and really working 
implementations that are either near or already in production. 
Additionally, the industrial track welcomes detailed software product 
architecture and implementation discussions on products that are near 
release or already released.

As the goal of the industrial track is to show the state of the art in 
applying service-based technology, papers must provide sufficient 
details on the application domain, and the service-oriented techniques 
used, the issues surrounding actual implementations and applications, 
and the lessons learned in the field.

DEMONSTRATIONS, TUTORIALS, PANELS and PHD SYMPOSIUM
----------------------------------------------------------
Submissions are also invited for:

- System demonstrations to showcase innovative implementation 
approaches, technologies and tools related to service-oriented computing;
- Tutorials to disseminate state-of-the-art knowledge in fields related 
to the topics of the conference;
- ICSOC 2008 seeks for panel sessions. The panels should be related to 
the topics of the conference needing discussions with the community.
- PhD Symposium, where PhD candidates will have the opportunity to get 
in touch with experts in their research areas and to obtain early 
feedback on their research results.

For further details, specific calls for each of the above activities are 
going to be disseminated through the main mailing lists soon; they are 
also available online on the conference web site.

FORMATTING, SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION
--------------------------------------
Formatting guidelines (Research Papers)
---------------------------------------
Prospective authors must submit an abstract prior to submitting their 
full paper – this abstract will be used in matching reviewers with 
papers. Research papers should describe innovative and significant 
original research relevant to ICSOC as described above. Papers submitted 
for consideration must not have been published elsewhere and must not be 
under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the duration of 
consideration.

All papers must be prepared in accordance with the Springer/LNCS 
camera-ready format and be submitted electronically (in PDF) via the 
conference web site. Research papers are not to exceed 15 pages, 
including all references and figures. All submissions should include 
title, authors, and full contact information. Detailed instructions for 
authors are available on the LNCS website: 
http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0&teaserId=45515&CENTER_ID=99829

Submission
----------
Submissions should indicate the scientific area that best fits the 
content of the paper.

Research papers and Industrial papers submissions must be done using the 
conference management tool before the specified deadlines using the 
following link: http://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/icsoc08/servlet/Conference.

Demonstrations must be submitted electronically via e-mail at this 
address: demo@icsoc.org.

For the PhD Symposium, submissions must be done using the symposium 
managment tool: http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=icsocphdsym08.

Evaluation
----------
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of 
contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, and 
appropriate comparison to related work. The program committee as a whole 
will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for 
presentation at the conference.

All accepted papers will appear in the ICSOC’08 proceedings (pending 
request), published by Springer Verlag as a part of its Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science (LNCS) series 
(http://www.springer.com/dal/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=1-164-7-72376-0). 
At least one author of the paper is expected to present the results at 
the ICSOC’08 conference. Selected papers will be invited for a special 
section of STTT (Int. Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer).
