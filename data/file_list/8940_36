CFP: Special session on Multiplex Network Mining@CASoN?2014

Context
Complex networks used to model interactions in real-world phenomena are oft=
en heterogeneous network with d ifferent types of nodes and edges. Focusing=
 on a single type of nodes, a complex network would be better described by =
a multiplex: a set of nodes related to each other with different types of r=
elations. This representation is much richer than simple complex networks o=
ften used to model complex interaction systems. However, this poses the cha=
llenge to provide adequate answers to all basic network analysis tasks that=
 have been studied and provided in the recent few years for the case of hom=
ogeneous networks. This include for instance: the problem of node ranking (=
computing nodes centralities), community detection, link prediction, inform=
ation diffusion models and network visualization. Almost all work in the fi=
eld of multiplex network analysis are based on transforming the problem, in=
 a way or another to the classical case of homogeneous network analysis.
Existing approaches include: layer aggregation based approaches or applying=
 ensemble methods on results obtained on eac h layer aside . Little work ha=
s focused on analyzing all layers at once. The goal of this session is to m=
ake the point on new approaches for multiplex network analysis and mining.

Topics

A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics include:

Models & measures for multiplex networks
      Centrality in multiplex networks
      Paths, clustering coefficient in multiplex networks
      Random walks on multiplex networks
      Co-evolution of layers in multiplex networks.
      Layer aggregation approaches.
      Vertex similarity in multiplex network

Community detection in multiplex network
      Multiplex network partitioning
      Multi-layer modularity functions
      Overlapping community detection

Dynamic & multiplex networks
      Link prediction in multiplex network
      Missing links detection
      Multiplex network evolution models
      Dynamic networks as a multiplex=20

Machine learning approaches=20=20
      Ensemble learning for multiplex network mining
      Multi-view clustering
      Collaboratif learning

Applications=20
      Recommender systems
      Heterogeneous network mining
      Reality mining
      Mobility data mining
      Networks of networks analysis

Submitted papers should be original and contain contributions of theoretica=
l, experimental or application nature, or be unique experience reports.

The page limit for a full-length paper is 6 pages.=20
Short papers describing novel research visions, work-in-progress or less ma=
ture results are also welcome, with a minimum limit of 4 pages.=20
All submissions should be in the IEEE 8.5 two-column format.=20

Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and soundn=
ess, and will be reviewed by at least three independent reviewers. The conf=
erence proceedings will be distributed amongst the participants during the =
conference. Accepted papers must be presented by author(s) personally to be=
 published in the conference proceedings.
