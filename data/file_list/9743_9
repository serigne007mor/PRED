Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Information Technology for Business 
Intelligence (IT4BI).

website: http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr

Erasmus Mundus is a certification of excellence which is delivered by the
European community to the best international master programmes in 
Europe, and it
is supported by very attractive scholarships.

Since its inception 20 years ago, Business Intelligence (BI) has become 
a huge
industrial domain and a major economic driver, however overlooked by 
academics.
The Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Information Technology for Business
Intelligence (IT4BI) aims at training computer scientists who understand and
help develop the strategies of modern enterprise decision makers.

IT4BI is a 2-year, English-language programme jointly delivered by 
Université
Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Belgium, Université François Rabelais Tours 
(UFRT)
in France, Ecole Centrale Paris (ECP) in France, Universitat Politècnica de
Catalunya (UPC) in Spain, and Technische Universität Berlin (TUB) in 
Germany.

IT4BI targets students from all over the world with a Bachelor of 
Science (or a
level equivalent to 180 ETCS) with major in Computer Science, as well as an
English proficiency corresponding to level B2 of the Common European 
Framework
of Reference for Languages (e.g., TOEFL 580 or higher). Admission is 
granted on
the basis of a selection procedure.

The first year of the programme is devoted to fundamentals: the first 
semester
at ULB, the second one at UFRT. Then, all students participate to the 
European
Business Intelligence Summer School
(http://cs.ulb.ac.be/conferences/ebiss.html). In the third semester, the
programme offers three specialisations at ECP, UPC and TUB and students 
move to
the partner of the chosen specialisation. The fourth semester is 
dedicated to
the master's thesis and can be realised at either as a placement in 
industry, or
as an internship in a research laboratory in any full or associated partner.
Eventually, all students will be gathered in the workshop "Business
Intelligence: Innovation Meets Research". Upon completion of the program,
graduates will be awarded with a multiple degree, the national master's 
degrees
from ULB, UFRT and the university of the specialisation.

The IT4BI programme opens in September 2012.
Application opened November 2nd, 2011.

Tuition fees are
- € 4,000 per year for European students and
- € 8,000 per year for other students.

The Erasmus Mundus programme provides EU-funded scholarships to students who
have been selected by the consortium. The scholarship amount is
- € 24,000 per year for non European students and
- €11,500 per year for European students.

The deadlines for applications are:
- Students applying for an Erasmus Mundus scholarship: January 2nd, 2012
- Students not applying for an Erasmus Mundus scholarship: April 30th, 
2012 for
non European students and June 30th, 2012 for European students.

Please see the IT4BI website (http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr) for further 
details
and on-line application form.
