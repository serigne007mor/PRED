science, mathematics, statistics, forecaster, econometric, etc, in the
field of time series analysis and forecasting.

We encourage you to submit paper focused on interesting, relevant and
original works that are related to these subjects. We also admit the
submission of short abstracts, which must be extended to full paper in
