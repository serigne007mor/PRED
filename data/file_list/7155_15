 endowing the Web with the ability of understanding natural language 
 (NL). The aim of the workshop is to explicate, collect, discuss, and 
 generalize the models of informational (in particular, semantic, 
 conceptual) structures, the models of the correspondences between a 
 sentence or a short discourse and its semantic representation with 
 respect to a knowledge base, the models of the correspondences between a 
 fragment of a discourse and its semantic representation with respect to 
 a knowledge base and semantic representation of the preceding part of a 
 discourse, and the methods (algorithms) of processing information 
 expressed by means of NL either proved to be effective in any 
 application domain or being broadly applicable or universal as it is 
 shown by the results of the fulfilled theoretical analysis.

 Expected topics (their list is not exhaustive):
 - broadly applicable formal tools for constructing the text meaning 
 representations (or semantic representations);
 - unified formal means for representing text meanings and for 
 constructing high-level conceptual descriptions  of visual images;
 - the models of semantic-syntactic components of linguistic databases;
 - the models of the correspondences between a sentence or a short 
 discourse and its semantic representation with respect to a knowledge 
 base;
 - the models of the correspondences between a fragment of a discourse 
 and its semantic representation with respect to a knowledge base and 
 semantic representation of the preceding part of a discourse (in 
 particular, the models for finding the meaning of an elliptical phrase);
 - the methods and algorithms of semantic-syntactic analysis of 
 NL-texts;
 - the methods and algorithms of discovering the referents of anaphoric 
 expressions;
 - the models, methods, and algorithms of using the ontologies for 
 finding the answers
 to the questions of the users of full-text databases;
 - the models, methods, and algorithms of using the ontologies for 
 knowledge extraction from natural language texts;
 - the methods and algorithms of planning the dialogue with an end user 
 with respect to an ontology and knowledge about the end user;
 - semantics-oriented methods of cross-language information retrieval;
 - the methods and algorithms of transforming the meaning 
 representations into NL-texts;
 - intelligent text summarization;
 - content search and analysis for e-learning;

 Description of the proposed workshop:
 Due to the stormy growth of the Internet, a huge number of the projects 
 realized in the 2000s, first of all, in Life Sciences and Health Care, 
 and due to several other factors the users of the Internet and of 
 specialized computer networks have received the access to an immense 
 variety of information sources in many natural languages and to a number 
 of knowledge bases formed with the help of ontology languages, first of 
 all, the language OWL.

 With respect to this situation, many specialists in various countries 
 suppose that the only real way of realizing an effective interaction of 
 people throughout the world with these naturallanguage (NL) based 
 information sources and with knowledge bases is the development of 
 appropriate NL-interfaces and semantics-oriented advanced search 
 systems. In favour of this conclusion says the successful experience of 
 designing in the 2000s a number of NL-interfaces to databases and 
 NL-interfaces to Semantic Web (SW) data repositories.

 Since Web-based informational sources are formed with the help of many 
 natural languages, it is necessary to intensively develop the 
 theoretical foundations of multilingual, semantics-oriented information 
 retrieval on the Web and to expand the foundations of designing (for 
 many natural languages) the NL-interfaces to SW data repositories.

 On one hand, it is one of the central tasks for Web science - the 
 science of decentralized information systems. On the other hand, it 
 seems that this task is a part of more general, large-scale problem – 
 the problem of developing a Semantic Web of a new generation, where its 
 principal distinguished feature is to be the well-developed ability of 
 natural language processing.

 The process of endowing the existing Web with the ability of 
 understanding many natural languages is an objective ongoing process. It 
 is a decentralized process, because the research centres in different 
 countries mainly independently develop the translators from particular
 natural languages to semantic representations (or text meaning 
 representations) and the applied computer systems either extracting the 
 meanings from texts in particular natural languages or producing 
 summaries of the collections of texts in particular languages.

 The analysis shows that now it is high time to increase the total 
 successfulness, effectiveness of this global decentralized process. In 
 particular, it would be important with respect to the need of 
 cross-language conceptual information retrieval and question - 
 answering. Most often, semantics-oriented natural language processing 
 systems, or linguistic processors (LPs), are complex computer systems, 
 their design requires a considerable time, and its cost is rather high. 
 Usually, it is necessary to construct a series of LPs, step by step 
 expanding the input sublanguage of NL and satisfying the requirements of 
 the end users. On the other hand, the same regularities of NL are 
 manifested in the texts pertaining to various thematic domains.

 That is why, in order to diminish the total expenses of designing a 
 family of LPs by one research centre or group during a certain 
 several-year time interval and in order to minimize the duration of 
 designing each particular system from this family of LPs, it seems to be 
 reasonable to pay more attention to: (a) the search for best typical 
 design solutions concerning the key semantic-syntactic subsystems of LPs 
 with the aim to use these solutions in different domains of employing 
 LPs; (b) the elaboration of domain-independent formal means for 
 describing the main data structures and principal procedures of 
 algorithms implemented in semantic-syntactic analyzers of NL-texts or in 
 the synthesizers of NL-texts.

 That is why it appears that the adherence to the following two 
 principles in the design of semantics-oriented LPs by one research 
 centre or a group (but better – by many centres and groups) will 
 contribute, in the long-term perspective, to reducing the total cost of 
 designing a family of LPs and to minimizing the duration of constructing 
 each particular system from this family:

 The Principle of Stability of the used language of semantic 
 representations in the context of various tasks, various domains and 
 various software environments (stability is understood as the employment 
 of a unified collection of rules for building the semantic structures as 
 well as domain- and task-specific variable set of primitive 
 informational units);

 The Principle of Succession of the algorithms of LP based on using one 
 or more compatible formal models of a linguistic database and unified 
 formal means for representing the intermediate and final results of 
 semantic-syntactic analysis of natural-language texts in the context of 
 various tasks, various domains and various software environments (the 
 succession means that the algorithms implemented in basic subsystems of 
 LP are repeatedly used by different linguistic processors).

 The aim of the workshop is to explicate, collect, discuss, and 
 generalize the models of informational structures, the models of 
 informational correspondences, and the methods (algorithms) of 
 processing information expressed by means of natural language either 
 proved to be effective in any application domain or being broadly 
 applicable or universal as it is shown by the results of a carried our 
 theoretical analysis.

 The particular objectives of the workshop are as follows:
 (1) to explicate the collection of ideas, models, methods, and 
 algorithms allowing for designing semantics-oriented (a) NL-interfaces 
 being convenient, attractive for the end users of recommender systems 
 and another Web-based applied computer systems; (b) advanced Web-based 
 search systems;
 (2) to carry out a comparative analysis of the available formal means 
 of constructing text meaning representations (in particular, the means 
 provided by the Theory of Conceptual Graphs, Episodic Logic, and Theory 
 of K-representations) from the standpoint of following the Principle of 
 Stability of the used language of semantic representations;
 (3) taking into account the available effective models of informational 
 structures, the models of informational correspondences, and the methods 
 (algorithms) of processing natural language texts, to discuss the 
 possibilities of expanding the strategy of transforming the existing Web 
 into Semantic Web of a new generation (or a Meanings Understanding Web 
 or a Multilingual Semantic Web) proposed by V.A. Fomichov in the

 Models and Algorithms”, Springer: New York, Dordrecht, Heidelberg,
