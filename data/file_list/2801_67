Subject: [liste-egc] INRIA Starting Research Position in Music Information
 Retrieval at CNAM Paris

[Apologies for duplicated postings]

The Vertigo team within the laboratory Cedric at CNAM Paris is inviting
applications for an Inria "Starting Research Position":
  https://www.inria.fr/en/institute/careers/offers/starting-research-positions/presentation

Our team research activities focus on large-scale multimedia data processing, in
particular data related to written music (music score collections), with
applications such as score generation and transcription, (music) information
retrieval, automated and assisted analysis and preservation, in collaboration
with musicologists and librarians. We are developing software (e.g.,
Neuma/Scorelib http://scorelib.huma-num.fr/) and resources for music score
management and in the same time work on modelling musical languages in a context
of computational humanities.

Inria has launched its 2019 campaign for hiring 10 starting research
scientists, on a three-year contract. If you are willing to apply and join
the Vertigo team, or if you have any question, please contact:

   - Philippe Rigaux (head of Cedric Laboratory, philippe.rigaux@cnam.fr)
   - Marin Ferecatu (head of Vertigo team, marin.ferecatu@cnam.fr)
   - Florent Jacquemard (Inria researcher in Vertigo team, florent.jacquemard@inria.fr)

The candidate will have a PhD degree and 2 to 8 years of experience in research
after the thesis.

Important dates

   - deadline for application: April 3rd, 2019
   - interview and acceptance results: June 2019
