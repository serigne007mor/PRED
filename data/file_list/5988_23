 Toulouse - Projet ANR CoST (2019-2022)

PHD and Internship positions at IRIT (Toulouse) funded by the ANR  COST 
project (2019-2022)

Title: Deep models for task-based information retrieval

Keywords: information retrieval, deep sequential models, deep 
reinforcement learning

Advisors: Eric Gaussier (eric.gaussier@imag.fr), Karen Pinel-Sauvagnat 
(karen.pinel-sauvagant@irit.fr), Lynda Tamine-Lechani 
(lynda.lechani@irit.fr)

===============
Context
===============

While search systems today are very efficient for simple look-up 
information tasks (fact-finding search), they are unable to guide users 
engaged in exploratory, multi-step and highly cognitive search tasks 
(e.g, diagnosis, human learning). Hence, paradoxically, while we 
consider information search nowadays to be ’natural’ and ’easy’, search 
systems are not yet able to provide adequate support for achieving a 
wide range of real-life work complex search tasks[1]. In the CoST 
project (funded by ANR 2019-2022), we envision a shift from search 
engines to task completion engines by dynamically assisting users in 
making the optimal decisions, empowering them to achieve multi-step 
complex search tasks. While most of previous work rely on query-aware 
models and techniques to structure the session context and model search 
satisfaction [2,3,4] at the query level, we rather attempt to design 
task-aware IR models to make task-level satisfaction predictions.
===================================

PhD
===================================
This PhD will be focussed on applying neural approaches for task-based 
information retrieval. Based on the findings that have raised from 
previous works about the effectiveness of seq2seg models to capture 
reformulation patterns for the next query prediction task [4,5], we 
envision new end-to-end network architectures that make possible to 
account for sequences of sub-tasks.  We will also explore end-to-end 
learning for task satisfaction prediction based on deep reinforcement 
learning that goes beyond query-level relevance. The candidate will 
investigate the modelling, the deployment and evaluation of search 
assistance techniques (eg., query suggestion) and ranking models using 
deep neural networks architectures.  The evaluation of the resulting 
systems will be carried out using both public benchmarks (eg., TREC 
Tasks, TREC session, AOL dataset) as well as laboratory-built datasets 
built within the CoST project.
- Starting and duration: September 2019, 36 months
- Skills: the successful candidate is expected to have skills/background 
in information retrieval, machine learning, deep learning. Background in 
reinforcement learning would be greatly appreciated.
===================================

Internship.
===================================
This internship will be focused on: (1) a review of recent neural 
approaches for next query prediction in session-based search; (2) the 
development of a baseline framework for query prediction in task-based 
search.
- Starting and duration: March 2019, 4-6 months
- The successful candidate is expected to have skills/background in 
information retrieval and machine learning.
