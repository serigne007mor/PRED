Subject: [liste-egc] WWW 2012 workshop "Messaging and Web of Data" (April
 16, 2012 - Lyon France)

******************************************************************
*Messaging and Web of Data: Private meets Public (and vice-versa)*
******************************************************************
International Workshop in conjunction
with the 21st World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2012)
April 16, 2012 - Lyon, France (afternoon)

http://email2012.ui.sav.sk/

*Important Dates*

Submission Deadline:     February 5, 2012
Acceptance notification: March 4, 2012
Camera-ready submission: March 15, 2012
Workshop date:           April 16, 2012

*Workshop objective and goals*

The growing amount of public available data on the WWW is a new 
opportunity to improve Messaging systems (e.g. Email, Social Media, 
Instant Messaging) in multiple forms, such as messages content, 
processing (classification, etc.) and presentation. This workshop is 
dedicated to explore how public web data, such as identities, agendas, 
LinkedData, social networks or various information published on the web 
can meet private messaging data (semi-structured headers, information 
extracted from emails, footers such as signatures, etc.) to bring new 
insight for users, and prevent error or abuse. Reciprocally, messages 
can become public (think about public email archives, leaked email 
datasets, Twitter timelines, etc.), but sometimes to implement web 
standards to be efficiently identified, distributed and linked. This 
private/public duality and versality, applied to messages in general 
(and especially to email), is the basis of this workshop, which goes 
beyond technical aspects and aims at exploring impacts on users' 
practices, interfaces and trust.
In this workshop edition, we want to particularly explore 1) how to 
preserve privacy in the context strictly private messages (Email, Direct 
Messages) and public data (such as open linked data) by minimizing 
information disclosure, and 2) the integration of social media (Twitter, 
Facebook) with conventional messaging systems (Email, forums) in an 
everyday use, and its impact on data acquisation and organisation.

*Topics*

Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Archives exploration and analysis: Email mailing lists, web archives, 
structured datasets, email archives as knowledge base or business 
intelligence data source.
- Usage studies: usage patterns, behaviors, information overload.
- Technical impact: infrastructures, protocols stacks.
- Web standards: embedding web standards in messages, semantics, 
microformats, LinkedData and its integration and use in messages.
- Conversations: quotes, threads, sentiment/discourse/opinion analysis, 
dialog analysis, conversation graph.
- Social: identities, institution and individual reputation, 
folksonomies, collaboration and social media integration.
- HCI and visualization: interfaces, novel interactions, visual 
analysis,recommendation.
- Natural Language Processing: applications of NLP technologies, message 
understanding, topic modeling, message summarization.
- Information Extraction: methods and techniques to extract 
sensitive/personal information from email, entities disambiguation and 
coreferences.
- Interactions on the Web: instant messaging, RSS feeds, blogging, 
social network, tweets.
- Security and privacy issues: usable privacy, trust, phishing, abuse.

*Paper format and submission*

Submissions should report new (unpublished) research results or ongoing 
research. Submissions can be 3-4 pages for short position/experience 
papers, posters and interactive demos. 6-8 pages for full research papers.
Papers must be in English and must be submitted as PDF files. Papers
