The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to
represent, share and process information in various forms, ranging from signal,
image, and multimedia data to traditional structured data and semi-structured
data found in the web. SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that
increasingly play a key role in connecting systems across network centric
environments to allow distributed computing and information sharing.
