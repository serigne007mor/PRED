Scope

The LNCS journal Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered S=
ystems focuses on data management, knowledge discovery, and knowledge proce=
ssing, which are core and hot topics in computer science. Since the 1990s, =
the Internet has become the main driving force behind applicational develop=
ment in all domains. An increase in the demand for resource sharing across =
different sites connected through networks has led to an evolution of data-=
 and knowledge-management systems from centralized systems to decentralized=
 systems enabling large-scale distributed applications providing high scala=
bility. Current decentralized systems still focus on data and knowledge as =
their main resource. Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (=
peer-to-peer) techniques and the support of agent systems with scaling and =
decentralized control. Synergy between Grids, P2P systems, and agent techno=
logies is the key to data- and knowledge-centered systems in large-scale en=
vironments.

The third edition of this journal will be focused on data and knowledge man=
agement in Grid and P2P Systems. The importance of these systems arises fro=
m their main characteristics: the autonomy and the dynamics of peers, the d=
ecentralization of control, and the effective and transparent sharing of la=
rge-scale distributed resources.=20

The main objective of this edition is to make visible original research con=
tributions, to identify new issues, and to shape future directions.=20
