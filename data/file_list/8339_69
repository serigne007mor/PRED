The Third International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held during September 25-27 in Amantea, Calabria, Italy. The 
main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the 
dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction 
and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 
2013 provides an international platform for the presentation of research 
on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related 
to models and data and their advanced applications. This international 
scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean 
countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific 
networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.

Aim and Scope

Authors are invited to submit research and application papers 
representing original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be 
submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS 
format and should not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, 
references and appendices). Authors who want to buy extra pages may

purchase extra pages if the paper is accepted. Submissions which do not 
conform to the LNCS format and/or which do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 
pages with the extra page purchase commitment) will be rejected without 
reviews. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on 
originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of 
exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Duplicate submissions are 
not allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if 
it is submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been 
already accepted to be published in other 
conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions will be 
automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require explicit 
consent from all listed authors.
