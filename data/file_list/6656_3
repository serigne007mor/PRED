WEB INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNITIES (WI&C'14)

CALL FOR PAPERS

6th International Workshop on WEB INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNITIES (WI&C'14)
http://wic.litislab.fr

to be held at the 2014  International World Wide Web Conference (WWW'14)
Seoul, Korea, April 7, 2014

*Important Dates:*

Paper submission deadline:  Jan 14, 2014 (23:59 Hawaii Standard Time)
Acceptance notification: Feb 4, 2014
Camera ready paper: Feb 12, 2014 (hard deadline)
Workshop: April 7, 2014

Proceedings published in ACM Digital Library series.

*INVITED SPEAKER*
=20=20
Professor S=C3=B6ren Auer, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit=C3=A4t B=
onn & Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems=
 (IAIS), Germany
Title of the talk: Towards Web Intelligence through the Crowdsourcing of
Semantics

*SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP*

Web Intelligence consists of a multidisciplinary area dealing with exploiti=
ng data and services over the Web, to create new data and services using bo=
th Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial Intellig=
ence (AI) techniques. Communities appear as a first-class object in the are=
as of web intelligence and agent technologies, as well as a crucial crossro=
ads of several sub-domains (i.e. user modelling, protocols, data management=
, data mining, content modelling, etc.). These sub-domains impact the natur=
e of the communities and the applications which are related to them. These =
applications are numerous, and the success of well-known Social Network Sit=
es for entertainment should not be allowed to over-shadow the other applica=
tion domains, for instance in education, health, design, knowledge manageme=
nt, and so forth.

The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for res=
earchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative networks, suc=
h as virtual communities. The possibilities and consequences of the web usa=
ge for collaborative networks are tremendous and new tools are required to =
satisfy users and service providers.

The workshop Web Intelligence and Communities expects contributions on topi=
cs such as:

- User centric application based on social intelligence
- Linked data and big data for e-Communities
- Semantics and ontologies for e-Communities
- SOA, services and cloud for e-Communities
- Multi-agent models and tools for e-Communities
- Storage, querying, and diffusion
- Social, psychological and economical aspects of e-Communities
- Innovation and e-Communities
- Social networks enhancements
- Mobility and context-awareness
- e-Communities in ambient intelligence
- Transient e-Communities
- Personalisation, reputation and recommendations
- Privacy, security and trust aspects in e-Communities
- Applications: e-* (learning, health, government, games etc.)
- Performances evaluation, experiments, and user feed-back
- Process modelling for e-Communities


*SUBMISSIONS*

The Web Intelligence and Communities workshop welcomes the submission of th=
eoretical, experimental, methodological as well as application papers.
Discussion papers and demonstration papers are also welcome.

Workshop proceedings will be published through the ACM Digital Library.
All submitted papers must:
     * be written in English;
     * contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;
     * be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template(http://ww=
w.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) with a font size no smal=
ler than 9pt;
     * be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform), an=
d formatted for US Letter size;
     * occupy no more than six pages, including the abstract, references, a=
nd appendices.

It is the authors=E2=80=99 responsibility to ensure that their submissions =
adhere strictly to the required format.
All submissions should be done online on the workshop submission web site:h=
ttps://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwic14
