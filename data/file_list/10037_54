IEEE, IFIP, ACM CTS=922012
2nd International Workshop on Knowledge Management and Collaboration
(KMC2012)


We invite you to submit a paper to KMC 2012 Workshop in Denver,=20=20
Colorado, USA, May 21-25, 2012.
Workshop URL:=20=20
http://cisedu.us/rp/cts12/2-conference/workshops/workshop-02-kmc.
As part of The 2012 International Conference on Collaboration=20=20
Technologies and Systems (CTS 2012)
Conference URL: http://cts2012.cisedu.info/

Submission deadline: January 31, 2012


SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Knowledge Management (KM) has been occupying, at least since the=20=20
beginning of the nineties, much more important place within=20=20
organizations.  The necessity to manage both explicit and tacit=20=20
knowledge created and used in organizations has increased rapidly in=20=20
the recent years.  Organizations have become aware of the importance=20=20
of the invaluable capital owned by their members which corresponds to=20=20
their experiences and accumulated knowledge about the firm activities.=20=20
  Maintaining this capital is a powerful mean to improve the level of=20=20
economical performance of an organization.  Thus, companies should=20=20
invest on knowledge management projects in order to amplify the=20=20
creation, the sharing and the transfer of explicit and tacit=20=20
knowledge.  Several techniques can be considered to develop and=20=20
implement knowledge management and organizational memory systems,=20=20
according to the types of organization, its needs, and its culture as=20=20
well as the nature of knowledge to be capitalized.  For example,=20=20
Knowledge-based approaches, corporate semantic web, CBR-based=20=20
approaches, ontology based approaches, agent-based approaches, etc.

The objective of this multidisciplinary workshop is to gather both=20=20
researchers and practitioners to discuss methodological, technical and=20=20
organizational aspects of knowledge management, feedback of KM=20=20
applications, and especially using collaboration techniques for KM and=20=20
employing KM to increase effective collaboration.  Researches and=20=20
practitioners are invited to propose recent advances in methodologies,=20=20
models and tools for managing knowledge in organizations and to=20=20
discuss experiences of successful or unsuccessful knowledge management=20=20
projects.  Papers are welcomed in any research area concerning=20=20
knowledge management and discovery such as knowledge engineering,=20=20
artificial intelligence, information systems, and knowledge economy.=20=20=
=20
Target applications of this research and real work case studies could=20=20
be the following: Automobile, Biology, Design, Education, Medical=20=20
Domain, Telecommunications, Aeronautics and Space, Tourism, Finance,=20=20
Public Administration, Social, etc.

The Workshop topics include (but are not limited to) the following:
- Methodologies and Tools for Knowledge Management
- Knowledge Representation and Ontology
- Knowledge Acquisition and Evolution
- Retrieval and Delivery of Knowledge
- Knowledge Integration
- Knowledge Authoring & Knowledge Markup Languages
- KM for Collaboration and Decision Support

PAPER SUBMISSION
You are invited to submit original and unpublished research works on=20=20
above and other topics related to knowledge management and=20=20
collaboration.  Submitted papers must not have been published or=20=20
simultaneously submitted elsewhere.  Submission should include a cover=20=20
page with authors' names, affiliation addresses, fax numbers, phone=20=20
numbers, and email addresses.  Please, indicate clearly the=20=20
corresponding author and include up to 6 keywords from the above list=20=20
of topics and an abstract of no more than 450 words.  The full=20=20
manuscript should be at most 8 pages using the two-column IEEE format.=20=20
  Additional pages will be charged additional fee.  Please include=20=20
page numbers on all preliminary submissions to make it easier for=20=20
reviewers to provide helpful comments.  Submit a PDF copy of your full=20=20
manuscript via email to the Workshop organizers at nada.matta@utt.fr=20=20
and ines.saad@u-picardie.fr.

Only PDF files will be accepted, sent by email to the workshop=20=20
organizers.  Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews.=20=20=20
Papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance,=20=20
technical clarity and presentation.  Submission implies the=20=20
willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the=20=20
paper, if accepted.  Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that=20=20
their papers will be registered and presented at the workshop.

Accepted papers will be published in the Conference proceedings.=20=20=20
Instructions for final manuscript format and requirements will be=20=20
posted on the CTS 2011 Conference web site.  It is our intent to have=20=20
the proceedings formally published in hard and soft copies and be=20=20
available at the time of the conference.  The proceedings is projected=20=20
to be included in the IEEE Digital Library and indexed accordingly.

If you have any questions about paper submission or the workshop,=20=20
please contact the workshop organizers.
