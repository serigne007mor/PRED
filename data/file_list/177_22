EKAW 2010 workshop
REUSE AND ADAPTATION OF ONTOLOGIES AND TERMINOLOGIES
http://www-limbio.smbh.univ-paris13.fr/ReuseOnto-EKAW2010

=20
The workshop will take place during EKAW 2010, between October 11th=20=20
and 15th, 2010 in Lisbon, Portugal

CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION
Thanks to progress performed by the knowledge engineering area,=20=20
powerful methods for designing and use of ontologies are provided. As=20=20
a result, the scientific and industrial communities have gained access=20=
=20
to an increasing number of ontologies and terminologies. For instance,=20=
=20
within the biomedical area, several dozens of orthogonal or generic=20=20
ontologies and terminologies are currently available thanks to the OBO=20=
=20
(Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) or UMLS initiatives: the=20=20
objective is to make them interoperable and hence reusable.
The usage of an ontology or terminology is often characterized by=20=20
several factors between which we would name: application, scientific=20=20
or technical domain, language of data and of documents to be=20=20
processed, user profile, etc. All of them influence the content and=20=20
organization of the semantic resources (terminologies and ontologies).=20=
=20
Exploitation of these resources in this original context ensures their=20=
=20
optimal use and results.
We assume that reuse of such resources implies that at least one of=20=20
the designing factors is modified: application, user, domain ...=20=20
Hence, the reuse implies also that an adaptation of ontologies and=20=20
terminologies is performed. This process appears to be necessary in=20=20
order to guarantee an optimized exploitation of the reused ontologies=20=20
and terminologies.
=20
OBJECTIVES
Further to recent evolution of the knowledge engineering area and to=20=20
emergence of new context related to the reuse and adaptation of=20=20
ontologies and terminologies, several questions have arised and still=20=20
arise. We propose to address them in this workshop and encourage=20=20
submissions on topics related to questions such as:
- Which areas have developed and currently provide freely available=20=20
ontologies and terminologies?
- Are these ontologies and terminologies specific to a given=20=20
application, sub-domain or rather generic and descriptive of the area?
- At which extend the existing ontologies and terminologies may be reused?
- Whether the existing ontologies can be adapted to new purposes?
- Is their adaptation a suitable process?
- Is their adaptation less expensive than the designing of new ontologies?
- What knowledge elements can be reused: terms, concepts, relations,=20=20
roles, definitions ...?
- Are terminologies more easily reusable than ontologies?
- What methods and principles should be exploited for the adaptation=20=20
and reuse of the existing ontologies?
- How the mapping of ontologies may be helpful for their reuse?
- Which role play corpora in adaptation of terminologies and ontologies?
- Are Natural Language Processing methods helpful in the process of=20=20
adaptation of terminologies and ontologies? If they are, which of them=20=
=20
prove to be suitable?
- ...
This workshop may also be concerned with questions related to managing=20=
=20
of the evolution of ontologies and their versioning and to analysis of=20=
=20
evolution of their content (i.e., concept emergence, removal,=20=20
abstraction or specialisation), especially when combined with=20=20
questions cited above.
