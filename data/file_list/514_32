*Deadline Extension & Call for Papers*

DMIN 2009 - The International Conference on Data Mining 
<http://www.dmin--2009.com/>


*DMIN’09 - Extended Deadline*

The 2009 International Conference on Data Mining (DMIN’09) has extended 
its deadline to receive papers until *March 11, 2009 - so there is still 
time to submitt!* DMIN'09 has already received a large number of papers 
and will host three special sessions, three tutorials (please see below 
for details) and a large number of social events for networking ... So 
hurry up to ensure that you do not miss out on this year's event!

*_GENERAL TRACK SUBMISSIONS_*

DMIN-09, the 5th International conference on data mining, is part of the 
22 conferences held simultaneously from 13-16 July 2009 at the 2009 
WORLDCOMP conference, Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. Topics 
of interest include all aspects of data mining tasks, algorithms, 
integration, processes, applications and systems - a comprehensive list 
may be found at the conference website.

*_SPECIAL SESSIONS SUBMISSIONS_*

In addition to the main conference stream, you are invited to submitt 
your paper to any of the three special sessions at DMIN'09 :

    *
      Text and Web Mining
    *
      Real-World Data Mining Applications, Challenges, and Perspectives,
      and
    *
      Data Mining for Time Series Data - Forecasting, Classification and
      Clustering.

The special sessions will be held during the DMIN conference. All papers 
for the special sessions should be submitted using the standard 
procedures for DMIN papers (see website), but the appropriate special 
session track should be selected. Additional details for these three 
special sessions are provided below and at 
http://www.dmin--2009.com/special_sessions.htm

*Special Session on Text and Web Mining*

Organizer: Yanjun Li, Fordham University, yli@cis.fordham.edu 
<mailto:yli@cis.fordham.edu>

Text mining has been defined as 'the automated discovery of new, 
previously unknown information by automatically extracting information 
from different written resources.' Text mining operates on structured 
data from XML files or unstructured or semi-structured data sets (such 
as email, full-text documents, and HTML files). Text mining applications 
include information extraction, topic tracking, summarization, 
categorization, clustering, concept linkage, information visualization, 
and question answering. Web mining is the application of data mining 
techniques to discover patterns from the World Wide Web and includes web 
usage mining, web content mining, and web structure mining. Web mining 
applications are in high demand since they can be used to improve the 
effectiveness of search engines.

*Special Session on Real-World Data Mining Applications, Challenges, and 
Perspectives*

Organizer: Mahmoud Abou-Nasr, Ford Motor Company Research and Innovation 
Center, mabounas@ford.com <mailto:mabounas@ford.com>

The past decade has witnessed a vast growth of the amount of data 
produced and the proliferation of specialized databases in a wide range 
of business, industrial, medical and scientific applications. Data 
mining is becoming an

increasingly important tool in the process of knowledge discovery and 
the transformation of data into valuable information. The objective of 
this special session is to provide a forum for the data mining 
researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss data mining 
applications, issues, and the challenges that arise when addressing 
real-world problems (e.g. dealing with highly skewed data sets, massive 
and high dimensional data sets, non- stationary data, unknown 
misclassification costs, lack of training data, missing and noisy data, 
business process issues, etc.).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

. Enterprise knowledge management/knowledge discovery

. Sales forecasting

. Automotive diagnostics

. Medical diagnostics

. Bioinformatics

. Challenges, including

o highly skewed data sets

o massive and high dimensional data sets

o non-stationary data

o unknown misclassification costs

o missing and noisy data

*Special Session on Data Mining for Time Series Data - Forecasting, 
Classification and Clustering*

Organizers: Sven F. Crone & Nikolaos Kourentzes, Lancaster Centre for 
Forecasting at the Department of Management Science, Lancaster 
University Management School, UK, email for all enquiries: 
n.kourentzes@lancaster.ac.uk <mailto:n.kourentzes@lancaster.ac.uk> 
(alternatively please use s.crone@lancaster.ac.uk 
<mailto:s.crone@lancaster.ac.uk>)

This special session of DMIN'09 will cover all aspects of data mining 
for time series data, particularly forecasting, classification and 
clustering of time series.

*_SUBMISSION OF PAPERS TO GENERAL TRACK AND SPECIAL SESSIONS:_*

Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper in PDF format

(up to 7 pages, standard double column IEEE style, single spaced,

10 pt font size, margins left/right/bottom/top 0.75" (19 mm), first page

top margin 1" (25 mm)), to the DMIN'09 online paper submission system

by Mar. 11, 2009. The link to the online submission system will be

available on the DMIN'09 website (www.dmin--2009.com 
<http://www.dmin--2009.com/>).

The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to

7 (IEEE style) pages. Papers must not have been previously published

or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of

the draft paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,

postal address, and email address of each author as well as the name

of the conference the paper is being submitted to (i.e., DMIN'09).

The first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author

and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the

content of the paper.

To reflect upon feedback from last year we will extend the feedback

given within the review in aligning them with the IEEE guidelines

for IJCNN and WCCI. In particular, we aim at a fair, objective and

transparent review process. Therefore, we are publishing the review

criteria to further support the reviews provided (see www.dmin--2009.com 
<http://www.dmin--2009.com/>).

Papers will be evaluated for relevance to DMIN, originality,

significance, information content, clarity, and soundness on an

international level. Each aspect will be evaluated on a scale of

1 (bad - reject) to 10 (excellent - accept) or 10%-100%. Papers

need to achieve at least 50% overall score to be accepted without

mandatory revisions. Each paper will be refereed by at least two

researchers in the topical area, and all reviews are being considered

for the acceptance/rejection decision. Each reviewer can indicate

their expertise and therefore their relative confidence in a

particular recommendation. The camera-ready papers will be reviewed

by one person.

We particularly encourage submissions of industrial applications and

case studies from practitioners. To reflect the requirements of an

application or project centric case study presentation, these will

be subject to different review criteria. In particular, they will

not be evaluated using predominantly theoretical research criteria

of originality etc., but will take general interest and presentation

stronger into consideration. The camera-ready papers will be reviewed

by one person.

*_TUTORIAL SESSIONS_*

All tutorials are free to registered conference attendees of all 
conferences held at WOLDCOMP'09. Those who are interested in attending 
one or more of the tutorials are to sign up on site at the conference 
registration desk in Las Vegas. A complete & current list of WORLDCOMP 
Tutorials can be found here.

In addition to tutorials at other conferences, DMIN'09 provides a set of 
tutorials dedicated to Data Mining topics. The 2007 key tutorial was 
given by Prof. Eamonn Keogh on Time Series Clustering. The 2008 key 
tutorial was presented by Mikhail Golovnya (Senior Scientist, Salford 
Systems, USA) on Advanced Data Mining Methodologies. This year DMIN will 
provide the following tutorials:

*Tutorial A: Data Mining with Sensitivity to Rare Events and Class 
Imbalance*

Organizer: Nitesh V. Chawla, University of Notre Dame, USA

Recent years brought increased interest in applying data mining 
techniques to difficult 'real-world' problems, many of which are 
characterized by imbalanced learning data, where at least one class is 
much rarer relative to others. Examples include (but are not limited 
to): fraud/intrusion detection, risk management, medical 
diagnosis/monitoring, bioinformatics, text categorization and 
personalization of information. The problem of imbalanced data is also 
often associated with asymmetric costs of misclassifying elements of 
different classes. Additionally the distribution of the test data may 
differ from that of the learning sample and the true misclassification 
costs may be unknown at learning time. Predictive accuracy, a popular 
choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, will not be 
appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or the costs of different 
errors vary markedly.

This tutorial will introduce the problem of class imbalance, address the 
scope of solutions available, present and contrast the appropriate 
metrics for evaluating performance, and discuss the applications with 
case studies.

*Tutorial B: Emerging Human-Web Interaction Research*

Peter Geczy, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and 
Technology (AIST), Japan

Date & Time: July 14, 2009 (6:00 - 8:00 pm) - tentative

Description:

World wide web has evolved from its earlier static form to an 
interactive multimedia environment. Richness of interactions is rapidly 
approaching that of the conventional stand-alone applications. Human 
interactivity with web-based environments has been gaining increasing 
importance in both web research and e-commerce. Mining and exploring 
human-web interactions bring numerous challenges as well as 
opportunities. We will probe into the processes and methods of human-web 
interaction research ranging from data acquisition techniques, 
throughout analytics, to applications. Accounting for the latest 
advances in the field, we will project the prospective future trends.

Objective:

The primary objective of the tutorial is to provide clear, yet 
reasonably comprehensive, overview of the underlying principles, current 
approaches, and potential future trends. Knowledge of the 
state-of-the-art in human-web interaction research should be beneficial 
to a wide spectrum of individuals studying, utilizing, designing, and/or 
managing web-based information systems.

Audience:

The tutorial aims to approach a broad audience including, but not limited

to:

- Students and Educators

- Academics and Researchers

- Practitioners and Managers

The topic shall be presented in an accessible and intuitive manner 
without extensive technical details.
