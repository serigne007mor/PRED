advance and promote your topics and gain increased visibility. The 
tutorials will be announced on the SEMANTiCS website and they will be 
seen by all participants. SEMANTiCS 2023 tutorials can be incubators for 
industrial and scientific communities that form and share a particular 
research and development agenda. They provide a forum for presenting 
contributions and findings to a diverse and knowledgeable community.
Furthermore, the event can be used as a dissemination activity in the 
scope of large research projects or as a closed format for 
research/commercial project consortia meetings.

=Setup and Requirements=
SEMANTiCS 2023 tutorials may be either half or full day long. Tutorials 
take place on the days before and/or after the main SEMANTiCS 2023 EU 
conference (20th, 21st, and/or 22nd of September 2023). Details will be 
communicated on time.

brief abstract (less than 200 words) intended for the SEMANTiCS 2023 website
* a statement addressing why the event is important, why the event is 
timely, how it is relevant to SEMANTiCS 2023 and the field of semantic 
web. For the tutorials, why the presenters are qualified for a 
high-quality introduction of the topic
* a statement addressing the quality assurance criterion that will be 
used for the tutorial presenters..
* structure of the event and plans for generating and stimulating 
discussion; how will the interaction be organized in case of a hybrid event

number of participants, and (in case of previously held events) number 
of registered attendees and web site for previous editions of the event
* a description of the intended audience and the expected learning outcomes
