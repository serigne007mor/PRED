--- FOCUS ---

The traditional focus of the IDA symposium series is on end-to-end intelligent
support for data analysis. In 2010, the series re-focused to support papers
that go beyond established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-
changing" ideas, whilst not always being as fully realized as papers submitted
to other conferences.

IDA 2014 continues this approach and explicitly seeks "first look" papers that
might elsewhere be considered preliminary but contain potentially high impact
research. The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to ERA, is open to all
kinds of modeling and analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is
expected to be an interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that cut
across domains.


--- CALL FOR PHD POSTERS&  VIDEOS ---

The IDA symposium particularly welcomes contributions by graduate students. In
order to support this objective, the symposium will have a dedicated Poster and
Video Track for PhD student research, and it offers reduced registration rates
to all students.

If you are a PhD student and would like to present a poster about your research
at the symposium, please submit a one-page abstract (in PDF format) by e-mail to

		ida2014.posters@gmail.com

Each abstract should include a title, and names and affiliations of all authors.
Poster presenters who would like to demonstrate software on a laptop are
encouraged to do so, but we ask you to explicitly mention this upon submission.
Within the extent possible, we will then strive to make available a table next
to your poster, which you can use for your laptop.

There will be two submission rounds, the early deadline leaving enough time to
apply for funding:

1) The early poster deadline is
		July 25.
Notifications for all abstracts submitted on or before this date
will be sent at once, and no later than July 30.

2) The late poster deadline is
		September 10.
All submissions submitted after the first deadline will be judged
on first-come first-serve basis; authors will usually be notified
within a few days. However, no more new posters can be accepted
once the maximum number of posters has been reached.


--- POSTER VIDEOS AND VIDEO PRIZE ---

To attract additional attention to your poster and research, all authors of
accepted PhD abstracts will be invited to submit a video of maximum two minutes
length. Videos will be displayed during the breaks, and the best video
presentation will be awarded a Video Prize of 300 EUR. The prize winner will be
elected by the symposium attendees, and this year's prize will be sponsored by
SAS. Posters and videos must be presented in order to be eligible to the prize.
Details about video submission will be made available later.
