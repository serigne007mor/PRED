----------------------- Conférence d'Apprentissage 2022 (CAp)-----

https://caprfiap2022.sciencesconf.org/

CAp is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of machine learning, applied mathematics, and related areas.

Two years ago, CAp was supposed to be jointly organized with RFIAP (the French Conference on "Reconnaissance des Formes, Image, Apprentissage et Perception") but we had to cancel both conferences because of the pandemic. Next year we try again, more motivated than ever :-)

In case you do not have time to read everything, here is a brief summary of what you need to know:

     1) Cap will be held jointly withRFIAP  (Conference on "Reconnaissance des Formes, Image, Apprentissage et Perception").
     2) Cap will will take place from the 6th to the 8th of June 2022 in Vannes (the 5th is dedicated to workshops for RFIAP)
     3) The submission deadline for CAp is the*1st of April 2022*  
     4) The conjoint event will host (5) inspiring and brightinvited speakers interesting for both communities:
         *Prof. Dr. Christian Theobalt*, Max Planck Institut informatik, Ge.
         *Dr. Diane Larlus*, senior researcher, NAVER LABS Europe, Fr.
         *Prof. Themis Palpanas*,Senior Member of the IUF, Université de Paris, Fr.
         *Dr. *Angelika Kimmig**, associate professor, KULeuven, Be.
         *Dr. Gilles Louppe*,**associate professor, University of Liege, Be.


 From the*5th to the 8th*  of July 2022, SSFAM (Société Savante Française d'Apprentissage Machine) and AFRIF (Association Française pour la Reconnaissance et l'Interprétation des Formes) will jointly organized*on the Tohannic campus of Université de Bretagne Sud in Vannes*,*CAp*  (Conférence sur l'Apprentissage automatique) and*RFIAP*  (Reconnaissance des Formes, Image, Apprentissage et Perception). The two communities have numerous common research problems and we believe
that this co-location will allow for very fruitful discussions. The two conferences will have separate submission procedures but all submissions will be handled through*EasyChair*.

     Key dates:
     - Joint Event : 5-8 July 2022
     - Cap papers submission deadline: 1st April 2022
     - Notification to authors for Cap papers: 17th May 2022

We encourage the submission of recent papers accepted to high level conferences and journals in Machine Learning.
Submitted papers can be either in English or in French and we encourage two types of submissions:

     - Full research papers on the theme of machine learning theory and its applications should not exceed 10 pages in CAp double-column format (including references and figures).
     - Short papers can be up to four to 6 pages using the same format as Full papers. They present original ideas and provide an opportunity to describe significant work in progress.

Some accepted papers will be presented in a*long*  (20 minutes) oral presentation and all the accepted papers will be given the opportunity to be presented as a spotlight (3 minutes) and as a poster at the conference. These presentations are an opportunity to have constructing and rigorous feedbacks, as well as to establish contacts with members of the french machine learning community. PhD Students are particularly welcome and encouraged to submit papers. Contributions will be freely distributed on the conference website, subject to approval by the authors.

The conference and program chairs of CAp 2022 invite those working in areas related to any aspect of machine learning to submit original papers for review.
Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:

     Learning theory, models and paradigms:
         Active learning
         Online learning
         Multi-target, multi-task, multi-instance, multi-view and transfer learning
         Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
         Reinforcement learning
         Relational learning
         Representation learning
         Symbolic learning
         Bandit algorithms
         Matrix and tensor factorization
         Grammar induction
         Kernel methods
         Bayesian methods
         Spectral methods
         Stochastic processes
         Ensemble learning and boosting
         Graphical models
         Gaussian process
         Neural networks and deep learning
         Learning theory
         Game theory
     Optimization et related problems:
         Large-scale machine learning and optimization
         Optimization algorithms
         Distributed optimization
         Machine learning and structured data (spatio-temporal data, tree, graph)
         Classification with missing values
     Applications:
         Social network analysis
         Temporal data analysis
         Bioinformatic
         Data mining
         Neuroscience
         Natural language processing
         Information retrieval
         Computer vision

We hope to see you at the conference !
