Subject: [liste-egc] Deadline extension 1st workshop Quality of Models and
 Models of Quality in conjunction with ER 2014

=====================================================
Call for Papers
First workshop Quality of Models and Models of Quality QMMQ
In conjunction with the
33rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER2014)
To be held in
Atlanta, GA U.S.A. from 27-30 October 2014

Extended deadline 30 May 2014

http://qmmq2014.cnam.fr/
=====================================================

Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that the deadline for submitting your 
contribution to the 1st workshop Quality of Models and Models of Quality 
QMMQ has been extended to May 30.

*Scope*
Quality assurance has been and still is a very challenging issue within 
the Information Systems (IS) and Conceptual Modeling (CM) disciplines. 
This ongoing research encompasses theoretical aspects including quality 
definition and quality models, and practical/empirical aspects such as 
the development of methods, approaches and tools for quality measurement 
and improvement. Research can be general and conceptual in nature or 
focused on specific application domains, such as web application 
quality, data warehouse quality, requirements model quality, model 
transformations quality, etc.

Although research contributions are highly diverse and relevant, they 
are not adopted by practitioners as useful solutions to reach better 
developed solutions.
Nowadays, with the development of web technologies and the growth of 
collected and exploited data volumes (or to exploit), IS and CM 
communities are faced to new challenges. They have to envision new 
perspectives to the problem of evaluating quality in IS.

The QMMQ workshop intends to provide a space for fruitful exchanges 
involving both researchers and practitioners having a variety of 
interests such as: data quality, information quality, system quality as 
well as models, methods, processes and tools for managing quality. The 
aim of the workshop is twofold: firstly, to provide an opportunity for 
researchers and industry developers working on various aspects of 
information systems quality to exchange research ideas and results and 
discuss them; secondly, to promote research on information systems and 
conceptual model quality to the broader conceptual modeling research 
community attending ER 2014.

Data and information in general need to be of high quality to be 
valuable. However, this quality, to be ensured, requires reliable IS 
that can only be designed with a precise ontological commitment. 
Moreover, research on quality needs more contributions based on 
experimentation to provide empirical evidences of successful IS design. 
Empirical Software Engineering techniques and protocols should be 
followed in the CM modeling to provide reliable and useful results to 
assess IS quality.

*Topics of interest*
- Quality constructs, models and ontologies
- Quality measures and instruments
- Experiments for validating quality models, measures and instruments
- Methodological issues of research on IS quality
- Method and tool support for improving and monitoring quality
- Quality of requirements engineering artifacts and processes
- Quality of models and meta-models
- Quality of ontologies and reference models
- Data quality
- Big data quality
- Quality modeling languages
- Ontological analysis of conceptual modeling grammars
- Cost/benefit analysis of quality assurance processes
- Quality assurance practices : case studies and experiences
- Experiments and case studies on quality evaluation.

Paper submission 02 May 2014
*Extended paper submission 30 May 2014*
Author notification 02 June 2014
