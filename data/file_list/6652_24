WIMS=E2=80=9914: 4th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining a=
nd Semantics
Thessaloniki, Greece, 2-4 June 2014
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/=20=20

(Venue, Accommodation & Registration Details incl.)

About WIMS=E2=80=9914 Conference
--------------------------------------
WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science conference=
s. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their state-o=
f-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine performance chara=
cteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent information techn=
ology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of Web-based i=
ntelligent information management solutions across different domains.

Objectives
--------------
The purpose of the WIMS series is:
- To provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to prese=
nt their contributions to the state of the art research and development in =
Web technology and applications
- To give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research to a f=
riendly and knowledgeable audience and receive valuable feedback
- To provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and =
practitioners can meet

re also authors).


Call for Research Papers/Posters
--------------------------------------------
WIMS=E2=80=9914 is intended to foster the dissemination of state-of-the-art=
 research in the area of Web intelligence, Web mining, Web semantics and th=
e fundamental interaction between them. Authors are invited to submit regul=
ar (12 pages) or short (6 pages) research papers or posters (4 pages) on al=
l related areas. Papers exploring new directions or areas will receive a th=
orough and encouraging review.

More details on the nature of the different submission types can be found a=
t:
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/?page_id=3D23

The papers in all the categories should describe original results that have=
 not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions =
will be evaluated by at least three members of the international program co=
mmittee.

Submissions should be made electronically in PDF or DOC/DOCX (MS/Open Word)=
 format via the electronic submission system of the WIMS=E2=80=9914 Confere=
nce Management system at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwims14=20=20

The submissions should be typeset using the templates of the ACM Internatio=
nal Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). The templates could be retrieved =
fromhttp://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates=20=20=20=20

Call for Application and Case Study Track Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this track is to provide opportunities for researchers, innovat=
ors, industry leaders, and practitioners to present and exchange ideas, res=
ults, and experiences in the applications of Web Intelligence, Mining, and =
Semantics (WIMS). The Application & Case Studies Track invites submissions =
describing implementations of Web Intelligence, Mining, and Semantics in in=
dustrial or government or other =E2=80=98real world=E2=80=99 settings. Pape=
rs must include descriptions of how the applications have been conceived, d=
eveloped, and (probably) deployed.

Details about the submission types and the submission procedure of this tra=
ck can be found at:
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/?page_id=3D154

Conference Scope
-------------------------
WIMS solicits regular and work-in-progress research, discussion papers and =
industry experience report papers in related fields. Papers exploring new d=
irections or areas are also welcome. In particular but not exclusively the =
submissions within the following major areas are relevant:

- Scalable Web and Data Architectures and Infrastructures
- Web Intelligence
- Web Mining, Information and Knowledge Extraction
- Web Semantics and Reasoning
- WIMS Applications
- Evaluation and Validation of WIMS Technologies and Applications

More details about the conference scope and topics can be found at:
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/?page_id=3D146

Publication
---------------
Accepted papers/tutorials/posters will be published by ACM and disseminated=
 through the ACM Digital Library through the International Conference Proce=
edings Series (ICPS).

A selection of the best WIMS'14 papers will be invited to be revised and ex=
tended for the post-conference publication in the Special Issue of the Inte=
rnational Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT).
