ADBIS=E2=80=992022 Call for Doctoral Consortium Papers
Torino, September 5 2022
https://adbis2022.polito.it
=
*************************************************************************

The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a forum where PhD students can present =
their research ideas, confront them with the scientific community, =
receive feedback from mentors and tie cooperation bounds. Students will =
receive inspiration from their peers and will have a chance to discuss =
their research objectives with senior community members in the context =
of an established international conference. The DC session will take =
place on September 5. Each participant will present her/his work, =
followed by a discussion with senior researcher. Receiving feedback =
about your work from senior researchers and discussing it with them is =
an excellent opportunity to receive valuable comments and suggestions on =
the research activity.
=20
One accepted paper will be awarded the =E2=80=9CBest Doctoral Consortium =
Paper Award=E2=80=9D by the DC Committee.=20
We are planning an in-person Consortium with a virtual option. All =
participants are expected to attend the Consortium meeting. Those =
authors who cannot travel due to Covid-19 will be allowed to present and =
participate remotely.

=E2=80=A2	Acceptance: 14 May 2022
=E2=80=A2	Camera-ready: 15 June 2022
=E2=80=A2	Doctoral consortium: 5th September 2022

Eligibility =E2=80=93 Call for Participation
We seek PhD students who have either determined the direction of their =
thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already =
published) but still have substantial work to complete or PhD student =
participants in the early stages of their dissertations.=20

Submission Guidelines
Submit a paper of at least 4 pages and at most 8 pages in Springer LNCS =
format and describe the state of the whole PhD project, rather than a =
specific completed result. You must be the only author of the paper. The =
paper should outline the objectives, the problem, state of the art, =
results obtained so far, and what is still to be done in the frame of =
the PhD project. Papers must be submitted via Easy Chair. Authors should =
consult Springer=E2=80=99s authors=E2=80=99 guidelines and use their =
proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation =
of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in =
their papers.

When submitting, you must explicitly state whether your document is to =
be considered for publication in the DC proceedings or not. To do so, do =
not forget to tick the checkbox =E2=80=9Cto be considered for =
publication in the DC proceedings=E2=80=9D at submission time.
Suppose you opt for considering your paper for being published in the DC =
proceedings. In that case, it will be evaluated by the DC committee and =
by the acceptance date, you will be notified if your paper has been =
selected for publication. Note that papers might not be accepted for =
publication but still be presented at the DC event.
Authors willing to present consolidated results must submit a paper to =
the main conference or one of the associated workshops. A paper =
submitted to the DC may not be under review for any other conference or =
journal when it is being considered for the DC.

Proceedings
The selected DC papers will be published together with the workshops=E2=80=
=99 proceedings, by Springer in the Communications in Computer and =
Information Science series.
Authors should consult Springer=E2=80=99s guidelines for authors and use =
their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the =
preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include =
their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of =
each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must =
complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author =
signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked =
on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes =
relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

Special Issues
A selection of the papers accepted in ADBIS 2022 will be invited for =
publication in a Special Issue of an international journal (to be =
determined). Extensions of accepted DC contributions might be invited =
for inclusion in the issue, particularly the best DC paper awarded by =
the program committee.
