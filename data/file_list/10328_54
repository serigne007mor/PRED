RCIS 2013 is a conference of RCIS Conference Series and is sponsored
by IEEE France section. This year, RCIS will be co-=ADlocated with the
31st French Conference on Information Systems (INFORSID 2013), a
prominent French scientific event  sharing with RCIS the interest on
the field of Information Science.


SCOPE AND TOPICS
The Seventh International Conference on RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN
INFORMATION SCIENCE aims at providing an international forum for
scientists, researchers, engineers and developers from a wide range of
information science areas to exchange ideas and approaches in this
evolving field. While presenting research findings and state-of-art
solutions, you are especially invited to share experiences on new
research challenges in these main topics:

- Information System Engineering
- Requirements Engineering
- Database and Information System Integration
- Data Management
- Information Search and Discovery
- Software Testing
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Web Information Systems
- Grid Computing and Cloud Computing
- Social Computing
- User Centred Approaches
- Decision Information Systems
- Knowledge Management
- Knowledge Discovery from Data
- Business Process Analysis, Modelling and Design
- Business Applications
- Information Security Risk
- Information and Value Management

Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although
authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related topics
are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the conference main
topics.


CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS AND BEST PAPERS
Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review
for other conferences or journals will not be considered for
publication at RCIS 2013. Authors are invited to submit papers in
English. Each submitted paper will have to be associated to one of the
four following categories.

- Technical solution papers present solutions that are novel or
significantly improve existing solutions. A technical solution paper
must include a preliminary validation of the proposed solution.
Results must be stated clearly enough so that it is possible to
validate them in later research (12 pages).
- Evaluation papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate
proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e. by empirical studies,
experiments, case studies, simulations, mathematical proofs, etc. The
research method must be sound and appropriate (12 pages).
- Industrial practice and experience papers present problems or
challenges encountered in practice, relate success and failure
stories, or report on industrial practice. The practice must be
clearly described and its context must be given (12 pages).
- Doctoral Papers are papers submitted by doctoral students only and
are related to research work in progress (6 pages).
- Poster papers as well as Demo papers aim to gather researchers in a
forum to showcase their work and obtain feedback on on-going research
from knowledgeable conference attendees (2 pages).

The submission site address is
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drcis2013

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of
them will register to the conference and present the paper. Only
papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference
will be published in IEEE Proceedings.

Authors of papers that obtain the highest marks in the reviewing
process will be invited to submit an extended version to a special
issue of the International Journal of Information System Modeling and
Design (IGI), to appear at the end of 2014 (vol. 5 issue 4).

Since Proceedings will be published with the IEEE Conference
Publications Program through IEEE Xplore digital library, paper
submissions must be formatted using the IEEE 2-column format (see
Conference Templates,
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.htm=
l).
They should be limited to a maximum of 12 pages and be submitted in
PDF format. Please use the IEEE PDF eXpress tool
(http://www.pdf-express.org/) to convert your source file into IEEE
Xplore compliant PDF File or to check if your own PDF file is IEEE
Xplore compliant. IEEE PDF eXpress is a free service to IEEE
conferences, allowing their authors to make IEEE Xplore-compatible
PDFs (Conversion function) or to check PDFs that authors have made
themselves for IEEE Xplore compatibility (PDF Check function). The
conference ID for IEEE PDF eXpress tool will be provided soon on the
RCIS 2013 web site. It is important to note that submitting a file to
IEEE PDF eXpress is only for creation of a compliant PDF file, you
must still submit your final paper through online submission.
