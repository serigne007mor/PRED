ASONAM 2015 CFP:

The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Network Analysi=
s and Mining (ASONAM) provides a premier interdisciplinary forum to bring t=
ogether researchers and practitioners from all social networking analysis a=
nd mining related fields for presentation of original research results, as =
well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development exp=
eriences. ASONAM 2015 seeks to address important challenging problems with =
a specific focus on the scientific principles, fundamental technology devel=
opment, and emerging applications associated with social networking analysi=
s and mining.

Submission Deadline: April 17, 2015

General areas of interest to ASONAM 2015 include three major aspects:

social and media analysis (e.g., communications, economy, business models, =
sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics etc.)
network science (e.g., mathematical models, theory, algorithms, etc.)
technology and applications (e.g., systems, tools, novel applications, crow=
dsourcing, etc.)
To fully embrace the fast-growing and vigorously dynamic trend of social ne=
tworks and applications, ASONAM 2015 is eager to consider any breakthroughs=
 in social network analysis and mining in the broadest possible sense.

General areas of interest to ASONAM 2015 include information science and ma=
thematics, communication studies, business and organizational studies, soci=
ology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology and medicine.
