The Summer School on
AI Technologies for Trust, Interoperability and Autonomy in Industry 4.0
8th to 12th of July 2019
Saint-=C3=89tienne, France
https://wiss.univ-st-etienne.fr/

We would like to invite PhD students and early stage researchers to apply=
 to the summer school that we organise in July this year on the topic of =
AI Technologies for Trust, Interoperability and Autonomy in Industry 4.0,=
 in a collaboration between Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet Saint-=C3=89tienn=

 Fraunhofer IAIS Bonn.
This summer school will have a unique format where participants will be i=
ntensively working on concrete industry use cases based on key challenges=
 identified by industrial partners during a workshop in April (https://ww=
w.iais.fraunhofer.de/en/business-areas/enterprise-information-integration=
/workshop-series-artificial-intelligence-industry-4-0.html) where academi=
a and industry will join forces to prepare them.
If you are a company interested in supporting this summer school, see spo=
nsorship plans at the end of this email.

Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The summer school will address various aspects of AI in Industry 4.0 (or =
Industry of the future) with a particular focus on:
	=E2=80=A2 knowledge graphs
	=E2=80=A2 the web of things
	=E2=80=A2 decentralised AI
	=E2=80=A2 responsible AI
Each of these topics will be covered in lectures and practical sessions, =

lligence
	=E2=80=A2 get in touch with high profile researchers and professors
	=E2=80=A2 build a network with other talented young researchers
	=E2=80=A2 hack together plausible solutions to stimulating real-life pro=
blems
	=E2=80=A2 have the opportunity to further develop your approach in colla=
boration with industry partners
The most promising contributions from the participants will be presented =
at a follow-up workshop in September (http://ci.emse.fr/ai4industry/) whe=
