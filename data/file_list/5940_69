Thread-Topic: Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems @ TheWebConf 2019

Subject: [liste-egc] Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems @ TheWebConf
 2019

CALL FOR PAPERS - Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems (HyperAgents 2=
019)
in conjunction with The Web Conference 2019, San Francisco, California, USA=
, May 13-17, 2019.
http://www.hyperagents.org/


-- Workshop Abstract

Hypermedia is increasingly being used in Web service design, particularly i=
n Linked Data and Web of Things systems where the use of static service con=
tracts is not practical. This evolution raises new challenges: to discover,=
 consume, and integrate hypermedia services at runtime, clients have to bec=
ome increasingly autonomous in pursuit of their design goals. Such autonomo=
us systems have been studied to a large extent in research on multi-agent s=
ystems (MAS). To consolidate the evolution of hypermedia services, it is no=
w necessary to have comprehensive discussions on integrating hypermedia sys=
tems and MAS, henceforth hypermedia MAS.

The goal of this initiative is to establish a common forum for both the Web=
 and MAS communities, and to create social, conceptual and technological br=
idges across these fields.


-- Important Dates

Paper submission deadline: January 27, 2019
Notification of acceptance: February 17, 2019
Camera-ready papers due: March 3, 2019
Workshop date: TBD (May 13-14, 2019)


-- Contributing to HyperAgents 2019

HyperAgents 2019 solicits contributions in all areas related to autonomous =
systems on the Web. We invite researchers and practitioners to imagine, des=
ign, build, evaluate, and share their thoughts and visions on what the futu=
re of the Web for both people and autonomous agents will be.

- Architectural Styles and Design of Hypermedia MAS
-- Design principles, models, and architectures for hypermedia MAS
-- Semantic Web, Linked Data and knowledge graphs for autonomous agents
-- WoT and physical environments for autonomous agents
-- De-siloization and data integration in large-scale hypermedia MAS
-- Specification and enactment of interaction protocols: Web interaction pr=
otocols, interaction protocols for agents (human and non-human)
-- Identification, authentication, and authorization of autonomous agents
-- Large-scale search in hypermedia MAS
-- Re-decentralization and distributed AI on the Web
-- WebRTC & peer-to-peer Web for hypermedia MAS

- Autonomous Agents in Hypermedia MAS
-- Architectures and programming languages for autonomous hypermedia agents
-- Linked data programming for autonomous agents
-- Context-aware agents in hypermedia MAS
-- Edge AI and physical agents on the Web
-- Learning in hypermedia environments
-- Large-scale automated planning and distributed reasoning on the Web
-- Integration of heterogeneous AI methods in hypermedia MAS
-- Models and mechanisms for agent coordination

- Governance in Hypermedia MAS
-- Norm-aware agents in hypermedia MAS
-- Hypermedia-based representation and advertising of norms in MAS
-- Reasoning on data licensing policies, terms of services, etc.
-- Privacy preservation and norm-compliant information dissemination
-- Models and mechanisms for enforcing Web-scale regulation
-- Trust and responsible agents
-- Web-scale open organizations of autonomous agents

- Hybrid Communities (People & Autonomous Agents) in Hypermedia MAS
-- Bridging formal semantics and social semantics (e.g., ontologies and fol=
ksonomies)
-- Web-based collective programming, customization, and maintenance of hype=
rmedia MAS
-- Hybrid social constructs for supporting autonomous reasoning and interac=
tion
-- Human-agent interaction in hybrid communities on the Web
-- Collective interaction models and agreement in hybrid communities
-- Mixed reality for hypermedia MAS (e.g., interactions, monitoring, config=
uration)

- Tooling & Applications of Hypermedia MAS
-- Programming frameworks, platforms, and other tooling for hypermedia MAS
-- Hybrid communities in the Web of Things (industrial manufacturing, home =
and building automation, smart grids, etc.)
-- Hybrid communities for enhanced social media (mitigating fake news propa=
gation, online bullying, etc.)
-- Hybrid communities for enhanced linked research (e.g., curating, sharing=
, and maintaining corpora and datasets)
-- Hybrid communities for rewiring the Web

In order to ensure a high-quality technical session, submissions must cover=
 one of the topics above. Authors can submit two types of papers: regular p=
apers (max. 8 pages) and short papers (max. 4 pages) in ACM conference form=
at. All research papers must be original prior unpublished work and not und=
er review elsewhere. All submissions will be peer-reviewed and selected bas=
ed on their originality, merit, and relevance to the workshop. Accepted pap=
ers will be published jointly with the proceedings of The Web Conference 20=
19. Submission requires at least one author to present the paper on-site. I=
f you can, we encourage authors of accepted papers to bring a prototype and=
 demonstrate it at the workshop.
