Call for Papers for the Special Issue on Grammatical Inference of the 
Machine Learning journal
https://grammarlearning.org/mlj-gi-special-issue

Scope and Background:
---------------------
The Machine Learning journal invites submissions on Grammatical 
Inference - the research discipline focusing on machine and 
computational learning of symbolic languages, at the crossroad of all 
research fields interested in learning formal models representing sets 
of symbolic sequences, trees or graphs (Artificial Intelligence, 
Computational Linguistics, Bioinformatics, Software Engineering, 
Robotics, Cybersecurity...). This special issue aims at gathering 
state-of-the-art practical, algorithmic and theoretical new results in 
Grammatical Inference.

Topics of interest:
-------------------
We welcome original research papers on all aspects of grammatical 
inference including, but not limited to:
* Theoretical aspects of Grammatical Inference: learning paradigms, 
learnability and learning complexity of classes of 
languages/representations
* Efficient algorithms and novel approaches for learning language 
classes, representations and distributions, inside or outside the 
Chomsky hierarchy, on strings, trees or graphs
* Grammatical Inference paired with semantics representations or 
information, for instance for learning by situated agents or robots
* New problems and successful applications of Grammatical Inference in 
practice, for tasks such as unsupervised parsing, biological sequence 
modelling, web information processing, robot navigation, multi-agent 
adaptation, machine translation, pattern recognition, language 
acquisition, software engineering, computational linguistics, spam or 
malware detection, cognitive psychology, etc.
* Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to 
language induction, including artificial neural networks, statistical 
methods, symbolic methods, logical and relational methods, 
information-theoretic approaches, minimum description length, 
complexity-theoretic approaches, heuristic methods, etc.
* Fairness and transparency of inference, interpretability of learned 
models and explanation of predictions in Grammatical Inference
Papers which, at the time of submission, have appeared in archived 
conference proceedings (e.g., in the proceedings of ICGI 2018 or other 
related conferences) will be considered provided that the submission 
contains at least 30% of new material (i.e., important additional 
theoretical or empirical results, extensions of the method, etc.) as 
compared to the conference version of the paper. Authors of such 
submissions will be required to enclose an accompanying letter 
discussing the differences between the conference paper and their MLJ 
submission and to describe clearly the overlap at the beginning of the 
journal submission. The decision on whether the 30% difference 
requirement is met will be made by the guest editors.

Schedule:
---------
June 15, 2019: Title and abstract submission to guest editors
July 15, 2019: Full paper submission to MLJ
October 30, 2019: Acceptance notification
December 1, 2019: Final version
December 20, 2019: Expected publication (online)

Submission instructions:
------------------------
Resources for journal authors, including templates and style files, as 
well as frequency asked questions can be found 
at: Instructions For Authors (https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach/redirectToBanner.aspx?defaultTarget=AuthInstr.html) 

Submissions should be made via the Machine Learning journal website 
(http://www.editorialmanager.com/mach/default.aspx). When submitting 
your paper, be sure to specify that the paper is a contribution for the 
special issue "S.I.: Grammatical Inference (2019)" so that your paper is 
assigned to the guest editors.
To help the reviewing process, we ask authors to declare to the guest 
editors their intention to submit by email (mlj-gi@inria.fr) with a 
title and an abstract (150 to 250 words) for their submission before 
June 15, 2019.

Guest editors:
--------------
Olgierd Unold, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology
François Coste, Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique
Colin de la Higuera, University of Nantes
