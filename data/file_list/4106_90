Bonjour,

Veuillez trouver ci-dessous l'appel à soumissions à la 27ème édition de 
Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL), dont l'échéance pour 
les articles longs a été reportée _au 5 juin_.

J'en profite pour souligner que les bibliothèques numériques sont 
définies comme étant des collections de documents (textes, images, sons) 
numériques (natifs ou numérisés) qui sont accessibles à distance. Les 
travaux exploitant ou permettant d'exploiter de telles collections 
rentrent donc dans le champ thématique de TPDL.

Ainsi, une très grande partie des travaux en TAL, RI, analyse de 
documents et humanités numériques (entre autres) sont parfaitement 
pertinents. N'hésitez plus !

Bien cordialement

Antoine Doucet

*************

*27th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries*
26-29 September 2023
Zadar, Croatia

Website: http://tpdl2023.dei.unipd.it/
Submission link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/TPDL2023

Call for Full Research Papers

Over the years, TPDL was established as an important international forum 
focused on digital libraries and associated technical, practical, and 
social issues. TPDL encompasses the many meanings of the term “digital 
libraries'' embracing the whole spectrum of the LAM community; 
operational information systems with all manner of digital content; new 
means of selecting, collecting, organizing, and distributing digital 
content; and theoretical models of information media, including document 
genres and electronic publishing. Digital libraries may be viewed as a 
new form of information institution or an extension of the services 
libraries provide.

Representatives from academia, cultural heritage institutions, 
government, industry, research communities, research infrastructures, 
and others are invited to participate in this annual conference. The 
conference draws from various research areas: computer science, 
information science, data science, librarianship, archival science and 
practice, museum studies and practice, technology, social sciences, 
cultural heritage, digital humanities, and scientific communities.

TPDL historically approached “digital libraries” embracing the field at 
large and also comprehending three key areas of interest that can be 
synthesized as scholarly communication (e.g., research data, research 
software, digital experiments, digital libraries), 
e-science/computationally-intense research (e.g., scientific workflows, 
Virtual Research Environments, reproducibility) and library, archive, 
museum and information science (e.g., governance, policies, open access, 
open science). As digital cultural heritage ties into digital 
humanities, TPDL aims to include this closely related field.

To broaden the scope of TPDL 2023, we propose four special tracks within 
the main program:
*Data Sharing and Data Citation*: this track aims to attract papers 
about (but not limited to) new challenges and innovative approaches 
connected to sharing FAIR data, sensitive data and legal aspects of data 
sharing, different approaches to data citation, data credit 
distribution, the use of datasets and databases in scholarly 
communications, new measures for research assessment, and the role of 
data in scientific research.
*Applications and Digital Library Systems*: this track aims to attract 
research and practitioner papers about applying established tools in new 
DL settings and innovative tools for DLs. This track covers various 
topics related to digital library systems and their applications, 
including system architecture and design, system scalability, 
interoperability, and security. Techniques for improving the search 
experience in digital library systems. User interfaces and user 
experience and studies of user behavior and user needs in the context of 
digital libraries.
*Digital Preservation and Curation*: papers in this area would cover 
topics related to the preservation and curation of digital resources in 
digital library systems, including issues such as format migration, 
metadata standards, and long-term preservation strategies.
*The Use of Persistent Identifiers in Digital Libraries*. The persistent 
identification of all entities within the research ecosystem is 
important in ensuring that research and its outputs are FAIR and 
connected. Papers could focus on different identifier systems, the 
creation and use of metadata, and innovative approaches to establishing 
connections between entities.

Note that the papers submitted to the special tracks follow the same 
review process as the regular papers and will be published in the TPDL 
2023 proceedings as regular full papers.

TPDL 2023 is hosted by the University of Zadar and will take place in 
Zadar, Croatia, from 26 to 29 September 2023. This is an in-person 
event. This choice does not exclude the possibility of following talks 
online, but authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to come 
and present in person. We aim to encourage discussion formally after a 
paper presentation and informally during social events and coffee breaks.

A selection of the best papers will be invited to submit an extended 
version to the International Journal of Digital Libraries.

Important Dates
Note that all deadlines are 23:59 (11:59 pm) in the AoE (Anywhere on 
Earth) time zone on the date specified.
