QAUCA'19

1st international workshop on Qualitative Aspects of User-Centered 
Analytics

Bled, Slovenia, 8 September, 2019
colocated with ADBIS 2019

https://sites.google.com/view/qauca2019

Interactive analytics, often called Interactive Data Analysis (IDA) in 
the literature, is an interactive, iterative process in which a user 
issues a sequence of analysis actions over potentially big datasets – 
the analysis of result sets influencing the choice of which action to 
issue next - with the ultimate goal of answering an informational need 
not necessarily well defined initially. IDA has attracted a lot of 
attention recently, as it is a difficult and tedious process, especially 
for inexperienced users, where targets may not be well defined and 
little is known about the structure and content of the sources. In 
particular, users are expected to undergo on their own what is often 
considered as a complex lifecycle: identify and collect sources, clean 
and transform them, etc. up to the interactive exploration by means of 
querying, on the fly building of Machine Learning models, etc.

The QAUCA workshop originally ambitions to gather researchers and 
practitioners around topics pertaining to the user-centered aspects of 
IDA, with a particular focus on the qualitative aspect of the 
interactive analytic process and the support of inexperienced users.

QAUCA welcomes original, unpublished research papers that are not being 
considered for publication in any other forum. Authors are invited to 
submit their work under the form of either a long paper exposing novel 
research works with preliminary results, or a short vision paper 
outlining research issues for future work. Rejected papers from ADBIS 
that match the workshop topics could be resubmitted to QAUCA and will 
undergo the same review process as the other submissions. Each 
submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee. The 
best papers presented at QAUCA will be invited for publication in an 
international journal.


Research topics include, but are not limited to:
- Quality aspects of interactive analysis: measuring exploration 
outcome, end-user experience, fairness, trust, transparency of data 
analysis, assessing subjective interestingness, benchmarking interactive 
analytics, etc.
- Facilitating analytics for the non data scientists: data journalists, 
decision makers, data enthusiasts, etc.
- Real life applications of user-centered analytics, case studies, etc.
- Models and language for user-centered analytics.
- User-centered methods and techniques for improving analytics through 
visualization, recommendation, reformulation, approximate 
query-answering, personalization, result presentation, data 
storytelling, etc.
- Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, 
information retrieval, search engines, etc.


Important dates
Paper submission: May 17, 2019
Acceptance notification: June 10, 2019
Camera ready: June 23, 2019
Workshop: September 8, 2019


Submission instructions
The page limit is 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for vision papers 
(in LNCS format). Excessively short submissions (3 pages or less) will 
not be penalized.
QAUCA also welcomes abstracts (at most 1 page), that will be presented 
in a "gong show" session. Abstracts focus on preliminary, vision or 
outrageous ideas about any of the workshop topic, and will be allotted 
180 seconds (or less!), without Q&A. The idea is to spark off-line 
blistering discussions between workshop attendees. Abstracts are 
expected to have a single author (but may have more), and authors of a 
full or short paper may additionally submit one abstract.

Latex submissions are highly encouraged. Nonetheless, papers prepared in 
other word processing software are also welcome. Papers should be 
submitted in PDF format via Easychair 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qauca2019).


Proceedings
Workshop papers will be published by Springer in the 'Communications in 
Computer and Information Science' book series. The Springer CCIS volume 
with workshop papers will be published only as a DIGITAL volume, 
available for downloading from the Springer portal.

The best papers presented at QAUCA will be invited for publications in 
the following journals:
Computer Science and Information Systems http://www.comsis.org/
Journal on Data Semantics (Springer)

The workshop chairs will select outstanding papers and will write 
letters in support of their submission to the journal Information 
Systems. The editors in chief of that journal warmly welcome such 
submissions which will then undergo the journal's review process.
