Adaptive monitoring and model update in a data stream context

Type de poste : Post-doctorant
Lieu de travail : Rennes
Th=E8me de recherche : Syst=E8mes cognitifs
Projet : DREAM


Environment
http://www.irisa.fr/activites/equipes/dream
The main research topics of the research project-team DREAM=20=20
(Diagnosing, REcommending Actions and Modelling) are model-based=20=20
monitoring and diagnosis of time evolving systems with an emphasis on=20=20
machine learning and data mining for symbolic model acquisition and=20=20
construction. Application domains are medicine (cardiac monitoring),=20=20
industrial diagnosis (monitoring of telecommunication networks,=20=20
intrusion detection) and environmental protection.
Recently, new topics related to data stream monitoring have risen=20=20
several issues, e.g. related to the fact that the monitored system=20=20
evolves continuously and that the data stream contains such a huge=20=20
volume of observations that it is impossible to record a complete=20=20
history. Then, how to detect that the observed system has changed to=20=20
such an extent that the current monitoring model is becoming obsolete?=20=
=20
How to mine the streaming data online in order to update the model=20=20
online to restore a satisfying diagnosis quality?

Missions
To tackle these issues DREAM has proposed a self-adaptive system=20=20
relying on a multi-source monitoring architecture associated to meta-=20=20
diagnosis. Mono-source diagnosers analyze continuously partial=20=20
observations coming from the observed system. They send their=20=20
diagnosis to higher level diagnosers which merge lower level diagnoses=20=
=20
while checking their compatibility with respect to integrity=20=20
constraints elaborated by experts of the domain. Whenever a constraint=20=
=20
is violated, the meta-diagnoser identifies some diagnosers that are=20=20
not consistent and the model of some of them should be updated. To=20=20
this end, each faulty mono-source diagnosers mines the observed data=20=20
continuously and applies its own revision procedure to update its=20=20
model, when needed.
Currently, diagnoser models are based on distributions of feature=20=20
values and the merging method makes use of the Dempster-Shafer fusion=20=20
rule.
This first proposal seems quite promising and we want to study new=20=20
merging methods, new mining and learning techniques to better cope=20=20
with the inherent complexity of a data stream context.

Activities
Recently, propositions of ensemble of learners-classifiers have been=20=20
made to tackle change detection: paired learners, stacked learning,=20=20
dynamic weighted majority, etc. The applicant should review these=20=20
recent propositions and study which ones could inspired improvements=20=20
to the above framework.
The applicant should also study how to integrate new kind of models,=20=20
e.g. symbolic or numeric temporal models, and new diagnoses merging=20=20
methods.
Finally, the applicant should also study new update procedures=20=20
associated to diagnoser agents. Note, that these procedures are=20=20
strongly related to diagnoser model representation paradigms. The=20=20
ideas will be evaluated on real telecommunication or physiological data.

Skill and Profile
The applicant should have a strong knowledge in data mining. Skills in=20=
=20
diagnosing and in data stream analysis would be appreciated.
