THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS

29-31 Oct, 2011 Porto, Portugal.

http://www.ida2011.org

When the biennial IDA Symposium series started in 1995, it focused on
the problem of end-to-end intelligent support for data analysis. IDA
2011 will refocus on an important and still emerging class of
problems: modeling and analyzing complex dynamical systems such as
economic systems, gene regulatory networks, social networks, systems
of natural resources, and cognitive systems.

The Symposium seeks "first look" papers that might elsewhere be
considered preliminary but contain potentially high impact
research. The IDA Symposium is open to all kinds of modeling and
analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is expected to be an
interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that cut across
domains. IDA 2011 welcomes papers that focus on dynamic and evolving
data, models, and structures.

In line with the new theme of IDA 2011, the IDA Frontier Prize will be
awarded to the most visionary contribution. Submissions considered for
this award must present novel and surprising approaches to data
analysis in the understanding of complex systems. The award consists
of a plaque and a monetary prize.

CALL FOR PAPERS

IDA 2011 solicits papers on all aspects of intelligent data analysis,
particularly papers on intelligent support for modeling and analyzing
complex, dynamical systems. IDA 2011 particularly encourages papers
about:

  - Novel applications of IDA techniques to complex systems
  - Novel modes of data acquisition and the associated issues
  - Robustness and scalability issues of IDA techniques
  - Visualization and dissemination of results

Intelligent support for data analysis goes beyond the usual
algorithmic offerings in the literature. Papers about established
technology will only be accepted if the technology is embedded in
intelligent data analysis systems, or is applied in novel ways to
analyzing and/or modeling complex systems.

The conventional reviewing process, which favors incremental advances
on established work, can discourage the kinds of papers that IDA 2011
hopes to publish. The reviewing process will address this issue
explicitly: referees will evaluate papers against the stated goals of
the symposium, and any paper for which at least one senior program
committee member writes an informed, thoughtful, positive review will
be accepted irrespective of other reviews. The proceedings of IDA2011
will appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

For more details on submission and review process, see the conference
webpage (http://www.ida2011.org) or contact the program chairs.
