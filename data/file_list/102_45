Apology for possible cross posting.

Dear Colleague,

I would like to inform you of the 2010 International Conference on
Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining

ASONAM2010

http://asonam2010.hau.gr/

The study of of social networks originated in social and business
communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced
significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social
Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the
online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging
systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning
techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that
fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge,
group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a
rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and
business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that
have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on
their structural embedding.

The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and
Mining (ASONAM 2010) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue
that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of
SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices.
ASONAM 2010 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus
on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social
networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and
theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their
application to real life situations.
