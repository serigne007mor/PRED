SIGIR 2019 Call for Doctoral Consortium

http://www.sigir.org/sigir2019/calls/doctoral-consortium/ =
<http://www.sigir.org/sigir2019/calls/doctoral-consortium/>=20

SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new =
research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques =
in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The ACM SIGIR 2019 =
Doctoral Consortium will provide doctoral students with a unique =
opportunity to have substantive interaction with other researchers =
regarding their proposed dissertation research.

The objectives of the Doctoral Consortium are:

	=E2=80=A2 To provide a forum where doctoral students can present =
and discuss their research with experienced IR researchers: the members =
of the Doctoral Consortium Program Committee.
	=E2=80=A2 To provide students with an opportunity to establish a =
supportive community, including other doctoral students at a similar =
stage of their dissertation research.
The Consortium will take place the day before the main conference (July =
21, 2019), with the format including: student presentations with plenary =
discussions, individual meetings with experienced researchers, =
interactive networking sessions over lunch, and breaks with a special =
emphasis on gaining insights regarding career paths after the PhD.

Prospective attendees should have written, or be close to completing, a =
thesis proposal (or equivalent). It is desirable that students not be so =
close to completing their PhD that the event would have little impact on =
their work, or so early that a topic has not been chosen. Before =
submitting, students should discuss this criterion with their advisor or =
supervisor.

To apply for a place at the Doctoral Consortium, candidates should =
submit a paper up to 5+1 pages in length - see submission guidelines =
below. Over the years, the Consortium has become increasingly selective. =
Candidates for the Consortium will be selected based on the potential of =
their research for future impact on the field of information retrieval =
and the likely benefit to the student of participation in the =
Consortium.This selection will be based in part on a written submission, =
solely authored by the student, following the guidelines below.

For each selected student, a one page extended abstract will be =
published in the SIGIR 2019 Conference Proceedings. Extended abstracts =
will be invited after selection, and should not be submitted with the =
proposal.

Doctoral students who submit to the Consortium are permitted to have =
previously published on their research, and are encouraged to submit =
full, short, or demo papers to SIGIR 2019 and associated workshops.

Priority is given to students chosen to attend the Consortium when =
travel grants are determined for the conference, and generally grants =
will be awarded to chosen students. Application details for travel =
grants will be available on the SIGIR 2019 website (You must apply for =
the grant to be considered). In addition, students accepted to the =
consortium will be eligible to receive a free workshop registration to =
attend a workshop of their choosing.
