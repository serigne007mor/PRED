Subject: [liste-egc] MEDI 2023 in Tunisia: First Call for Papers

Sorry for multiple postings

******************************************************************************
12th International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI 2023)
2-4 Nov 2023, Sousse, Tunisia
https://medi2023.org/

MEDI is RANKED C By CORE 2021
******************************************************************************
------------------------
Overview
------------------------
The Eleventh International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main 
objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research 
accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between 
the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an 
international platform for the presentation of research on models and 
data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and 
data and their advanced applications. This international scientific 
event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims 
also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, 
projects and faculty/student exchanges.

------------------------------
Important Dates
------------------------------
Full-paper submission: July 22, 2023
Acceptance notification: September 8, 2023
Early bird registration: September 18, 2023
Camera-ready: September 18, 2023

------------------------------
Submission Guidelines
------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application 
papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Duplicate 
submissions are not allowed. Papers must be submitted as a single PDF 
document, via the Easychair system.

Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS style (Latex style only for 
camera-ready papers) and should not exceed 14 pages. Submitted papers 
will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, 
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.

The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper 
if it reports interesting results but does not justify a publication as 
a full paper.

As for the previous edition of MEDI, all accepted papers including short 
papers will be published in Springer LNCS series. The book metrics 
available on SpringerLink to previous MEDI proceedings, 
https://link.springer.com/conference/medi give details on the number of 
citations, downloads, and readers at paper level and at book level.

One author of an accepted paper must register to MEDI 2023 in order to 
have the paper published. Each accepted paper must be presented at the 
conference by one of the authors.
