Dear Colleagues,

The fourth IEEE International Workshop on Complex Networks and their
Applications will be held in Bangkok - Thailand on 23 =E2=80=93 27 November=
 2015 in
conjunction with IEEE SITIS 2015.

Please consider submitting original scientific results to COMPLEX NETWORKS
2015

All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings published by IEEE
Computer Society <http://www.computer.org/portal/web/guest/home>.



The submission deadline is September 06, 2015.

* Complex Networks 2015*

*Fourth International **Workshop on Complex Networks and their Applications*

*Bangkok, Thailand, 23-27 November 2015*

http://complexnetworks.org <http://www.complexnetworks.org/>



*Scope of the Workshop*



Real-world entities often interconnect with each other through explicit or
implicit relationships to form a complex network. Examples of complex
networks are found in many fields of science such as biological systems,
engineering systems, economic systems as well as social systems. In line
with SITIS tradition of promoting interdisciplinary research, the
international workshop on Complex Networks and their Applications aims at
bringing together researchers and practitioners from different science
communities working on areas related to complex networks. The workshop
targets two types of contributions from prospective authors: contributions
dealing of theoretical tools and methods to solve practical problems as
well as applications solved by tools from network sciences. Both
contributions should stimulate interaction between theoreticians and
practitioners.
Authors are encouraged to submit both theoretical and applied papers on
their research in complex networks. Topics for the workshop include, but
are not limited to:



=E2=80=A2 Models of Complex Networks
=E2=80=A2 Structural Network Properties and Analysis
=E2=80=A2 Complex Networks and Epidemics
=E2=80=A2 Rumor Spreading
=E2=80=A2 Community Structure in Networks
=E2=80=A2 Formation of Complex Networks
=E2=80=A2 Generation of Complex Networks
=E2=80=A2 Community Detection in Complex Networks
=E2=80=A2 Motif Discovery in Complex Networks
=E2=80=A2 Visualization of Complex Networks
=E2=80=A2 Complex network mining
=E2=80=A2 Dynamics and evolution patterns of complex networks
=E2=80=A2 Community discovery in complex social networks
=E2=80=A2 Visual representation of complex networks
=E2=80=A2 Methodological problems in complex network studies
=E2=80=A2 Applications of complex network analysis

 *Publications *



All the papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the conference
proceedings. The proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society
<http://www.computer.org/portal/web/guest/home> and referenced in IEEE
Xplore Digital Library <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/guesthome.jsp>
and major indexes. They will be available at the conference.



*Important dates*



* Paper Submission: September 6, 2015

* Acceptance/Reject notification: October 5, 2015

* Camera ready: October 15, 2015

* Author registration: October 19, 2015
