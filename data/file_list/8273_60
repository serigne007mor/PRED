Call for Papers

The 22nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge 
Management, Oct. 27 – Nov. 1, 2013
San Francisco Airport Marriot Waterfront, Burlingame, CA, USA

http://www.cikm2013.org
Sponsored by: ACM SIGIR and SIGWEB

The 22nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge 
Management (CIKM 2013) will be held from October 27 to November 1, 2013 
in San Francisco Airport Marriott Waterfront, Burlingame, California, 
USA. CIKM is a top-tier ACM conference in the areas of information 
retrieval, knowledge management and databases. Since 1992, it has 
successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from 
the three communities. The purpose of the conference is to identify 
challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and 
information systems, and to shape future research directions through the 
publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. 
In CIKM 2013, we will continue the tradition of promoting collaboration 
among multiple areas. We encourage submissions of high quality papers on 
all topics in the general areas of databases, information retrieval, and 
knowledge management. Topics of interest in the three tracks include, 
but are not limited to:

Databases
* Access methods and indexing
* Authorization, data privacy and security
* Concurrency control and recovery
* Data adaptability, reusability and quality
* Database languages, models and interfaces
* Information integration, data provenance, probabilistic databases
* Cloud computing, peer-to-peer, parallel and distributed databases
* Query processing, optimization and performance
* Semi-structured data processing, XML filtering and routing
* Stream-based processing, real-time and network databases
* String databases, blogs and social search
* Systems, middleware, applications and experiences
* Temporal, spatial, mobile, multimedia and scientific databases

Information Retrieval
* Semi-Structured Information Retrieval
* Semantic and Entity-Based Information Retrieval
* Domain-specific IR (legal, genome, chemical, etc.)
* Citation Analysis and Social Networks for IR
* Distributed IR and Peer-to-Peer Search
* Filtering (recommender systems, topic tracking)
* User Modeling for IR, Search Personalization
* User Analysis and Privacy
* IR Architectures, Scalability and Efficiency
* IR Evaluation and User Studies
* Language Specific IR (multi-lingual, NLP, question and answer)
* Machine Learning for IR
* Multimedia IR (Audio, Speech, Video, Image)
* Web Search and Advertising
* Adversarial IR and Spam
* Novel IR Interfaces (mobile, explorative, interactive)
* Foundation of Information Retrieval (theory, ranking, etc.)

Knowledge Management
* Data mining theory, methods, and applications
* Machine learning applications
* Big data analytics
* Data warehousing and business intelligence
* Information extraction and filtering
* Knowledge Synthesis and Visualization
* Semantic Techniques
* Social networks and social media
* Knowledge management in innovative applications, such as healthcare 
information and network security intelligence

=== Paper Submissions for CIKM 2013 ===

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that 
are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts 
should be submitted electronically, in PDF format and formatted using 
the ACM camera-ready templates available at: 
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates. Papers will 
be handled through the online submission system 
https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/CIKM2013/.

ACM CIKM review is double-blind. Therefore, please anonymize your 
submission. Papers cannot exceed 10 pages in length. There is no short 
paper track. The organizers may offer the authors of selected paper 
submissions to prepare a shorter version of their paper for 
presentation. Uploading instructions and more detailed submission 
instructions for papers, and workshop proposals, are available at the 
conference website http://www.cikm2013.org.

Each accepted paper is required at least a full registration fee 
regardless of the status of the registered author. Also, one of the 
authors (or a qualified substitute) must give a presentation of the 
paper at the conference. Otherwise, the paper will not be indexed by the 
ACM digital library.

For any questions about paper submissions, please contact the program 
committee co-chairs at pc-chair@cikm2013.org.
