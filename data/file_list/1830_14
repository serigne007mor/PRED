Workshop overview

More than ever, reducing the cost of data integration by efficiently =
evaluating queries is an important challenge, given that today the =
economic cost in computing cycles (see your cloud invoice); and in =
energy consumption and the performance required for some critical tasks =
have become important. Besides, new applications require solving even =
more complex queries including millions of sources, and data with high =
levels of volume and variety. These new challenges call for intelligent =
processes that can learn from previous experiences, that can be =
adaptable to changing requirements and dynamic execution contexts.

This workshop follows a first successful edition in conjunction with =
ICSOC 2019 in Toulouse that led to a vivid program with interesting =
discussion (http://straps.imag.fr). The second edition of the workshop =
STRAPS aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data produced =
under different conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer =
simple, relational, analytical queries. These queries must cope to =
quality preferences associated with providers, algorithms and data =
trust. New scales in volume, velocity and value associated with =
integrated data collections require adapted solutions providing =
computing, storage and processing services potentially deployed on =
different highly distributed infrastructures and target architectures. =
With service, data and algorithms stemming from different and =
potentially huge numbers of providers, properties like provenance, =
quality and trust, arise as key properties to be quantified, evaluated =
and exposed to data consumers. How can data integration in such =
conditions be smart? This is the key question to be discussed by =
workshop participants.

Underlying approaches and algorithms continue to evolve particularly =
given the new levels of volume, velocity and value associated with data. =
Contemporary infrastructures for dealing with data are deployed in =
heterogeneous target architectures like cloud, multi-cloud, Internet of =
Things consisting of sensors and server farms deployed around the world. =
These infrastructures go beyond classic data management solutions and =
evolve towards different stacks configurations (data processing systems =
=E2=80=9Ca la carte=E2=80=9D).  They need to cope with new notions of =
scalability and of resources consumption guided by economic models, =
service level agreements and other quality warranties.

The workshop aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data =
stemming from different providers and produced under different =
conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, =
analytical queries ensuring providers, algorithms and data trust.=20

Topics of interest

We invite the submission of work-in-progress research addressing various =
aspects of data integration and processing done in service based =
