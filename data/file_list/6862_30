Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponent=
ial use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environ=
ments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the web and composed of mult=
iple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services,=
 software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on =
the interactions and inter-relationships among them. With the help of the c=
omputational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* =
properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) e=
nvironments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital com=
ponents", in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved=
, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend bi=
g data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platfor=
ms.

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly=
 complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to=
 how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, i=
ntelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies =
has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resou=
rces and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting=
 business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved throu=
gh novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data m=
anagement, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interacti=
ons, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to sup=
port the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International ACM Conference on Management of computational and collect=
ive IntElligence in Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring to=
gether a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industr=
y interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to res=
ource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and techn=
ologies can be evolved and adapted to this end.


Topics
-------
MEDES 2015 seeks contributions in the following areas:

1. Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
2. Green computing
3. Computational and Collective Intelligence
4. Services
5. Trust, Security & Privacy
6. Data & Knowledge Management
7. Internet of Things and Intelligent Web
8. Human-Computer Interaction
9. Networks and Protocols
10. Open Source


Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at most 8 A=
CM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with length limit=
 will be rejected.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the p=
reliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all r=
eviewer inquiries and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, revie=
wers notify authors with the final decision. Selection criteria will includ=
e: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and q=
uality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take s=
trong or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digi=
tal Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present=
 the paper.

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP.
