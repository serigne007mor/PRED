Second Call for Papers
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 2015 (AIME 2015)
Pavia, Italy, June 17-20, 2015
http://aime15.aimedicine.info/

The European Society for Artificial Intelligence in MEdicine (AIME) was est=
ablished in 1986 with two main goals:

1.     To foster fundamental and applied research in the application of Art=
ificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to medical care and medical research, =
and
2.     To provide a forum for reporting significant results achieved at bie=
nnial conferences.

A major activity of this society has been a series of international confere=
nces, held biennially over the last 24 years.

The AIME 2015 conference will be held in Pavia, Italy.

The AIME 2015 conference will be a unique opportunity to present and improv=
e the international state of the art of AI in Medicine from perspectives of=
 theory, methodology, and application. For this purpose, AIME 2015 will inc=
lude invited lectures, full and short papers, tutorials, workshops, and a d=
octoral consortium. Specific attention will be given in the main conference=
 to the theme "AI methods and approaches to address big biomedical data cha=
llenges"

June 18-19, 2015:  Main conference programme
June 20, 2015:       Workshops

Scope

We invite you to submit original contributions regarding the development of=
 theory, methods, systems, and applications of AI in BioMedicine, including=
 the application of AI approaches in biomedical informatics, healthcare org=
anization and molecular medicine. A specific focus for the AIME 2015 confer=
ence is on how Big Data challenges in biomedical domains could be addressed=
 using AI methods and approaches.

Contributions to theory and methods should present or analyse novel AI theo=
ries or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. It is e=
qually possible to develop new theories or methods, as well as to extend ex=
isting ones. In both cases, the work should demonstrate its utility for sol=
ving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying t=
heoretical basis. In addition, assumptions and limitations should be discus=
sed, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.

Contributions addressing systems and applications should describe the devel=
opment, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and syst=
ems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the=
 work to underlying theory, and either analyse the potential benefits to so=
lve biomedical problems, or present empirical evidence of benefits in clini=
cal practice.

The scope of the conference includes the following areas:

=B7       Big Data Analytics
=B7       Clinical Decision Support Systems
=B7       Machine Learning, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
=B7       Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies
=B7       Bayesian Networks and Reasoning under Uncertainty
=B7       Temporal and Spatial Representation and Reasoning
=B7       Computerized Clinical Practice Guidelines and Protocols
=B7       Healthcare Process and Workflow Management
=B7       Biomedical Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Management
=B7       AI methods in Telemedicine and eHealth
=B7       Case-based Reasoning in Biomedicine
=B7       Document Classification and Information Retrieval
=B7       Biomedical Image and Signal Processing
=B7       Visual Analytics in Biomedicine
=B7       Natural Language Processing
=B7       AI solutions for Ambient Assisted Living

Paper Submission

The conference features regular papers, in two categories:

1. Full research papers (up to 10 pages)
2. Short papers (up to 5 pages) describing either:
     a. a short research project
     b. demonstration of implemented systems
     c. late-breaking results (work-in-progress)

Papers should be formatted according to Springer's LNCS format (see www.spr=
ingeronline.com/lncs or www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) and submitt=
ed through the EasyChair conference system (https://easychair.org/conferenc=
es/?conf=3Daime2015). Authors are asked to submit an abstract first, and up=
load the full paper one week later.

The submission website is now open!

All accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings which will be=
 published as part of Springer's "Lecture Notes in AI" series. In addition,=
 the authors of the best submissions will be invited to expand and refine t=
heir papers for possible publication in the Artificial Intelligence in Medi=
cine journal (Elsevier).

Mario Stefanelli and Marco Ramoni Best paper awards

The best student paper will receive an award honoring Mario Stefanelli from=
 the University of Pavia and his accomplishments. Mario Stefanelli was one =
of the founders of the AIME community, an inspiration to us all, and active=
ly helped in advancing young researchers in our field. Selection of the bes=
t student paper will be performed by the Program Committee, and based on th=
e quality of both the paper and the oral presentation at the conference.

The best paper in bioinformatics will receive an award honoring Marco Ramon=
i. Marco Ramoni was an outstandingly respected faculty member at Harvard, U=
SA, and contributed to significant advances in the biomedical informatics f=
ield. Selection of the best paper in bioinformatics will be performed by th=
e Program Committee, based on the quality of the paper.

Submission of proposals for workshops and tutorials

As in previous AIME conferences, proposals for the organization of tutorial=
s and satellite workshops are sought regarding any of the above topic areas=
. Proposals for tutorials and workshops should be sent by email to John H. =
Holmes (jhholmes@mail.med.upenn.edu).
