Observation is one of the key issues in the understanding of environmental =
systems. A large amount of possibilities, ranging from local probes or netw=
orks to hyper-spectral remote sensing images, is at the moment available to=
 sense and extract environmental parameters. The huge quantities of data co=
llected by the new generation of captors that operate at fine temporal and =
spatial scales calls for new dedicated machine learning methods that can ha=
ndle this complexity. One of the main research axis of the OBELIX team is t=
o build new tools that allow to handle both theoretically and computational=
ly this complexity. The underlying techniques refer to scale-space techniqu=
es and manifold learning for the theoretical part, and to massive computing=
 using GPUs networks or cloud computing for the operational level. The appl=
ications of these works are concerned with classification or visualization.=
=20

More specifically, this PhD Thesis is concerned with the domain of manifold=
 learning, where one seeks a sub-dimensional space which best characterizes=
 the data, while offering a low-dimensional representation. Among a wide pa=
nel of methods, we have developed specifically a tool which is named PerTur=
bo. It is inspired by recent advances in computer graphics: Each class is c=
haracterized as a manifold in the input space (in a manner similar to the c=
loud of points giving birth to the 3D surface of a virtual object) thanks t=
o an approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As this approximation =
happens to be the Gaussian kernel, its perturbation measure (when a test sa=
mple is added to the manifold) can be re-interpreted in the kernel machine =
learning setting. However, when the dimension of the learning sets is too l=
arge, computational problems arise, mostly because the algorithm complexity=
 is $o(n^3)$.

Possible solutions to solve this problem imply that only a subset of the in=
put learning set is kept: this problematic is then a coarse-graining proble=
m. In order to build this coarse scale representation of the information, t=
he subsampling may try to preserve to the maximum some features of the mani=
fold. In the thesis, several aspects of this construction will be examined.=
 Also, different types of methods will be tested mostly implying either spa=
rse analysis but also random projections. The student will also try to adap=
t the corresponding solutions to the specificities of the considered data (=
spatiality and temporality), mostly related to environmental observations.

(Semi-)Automatic analysis and interpretation of remote sensing images are k=
ey elements to understand our environment. The development of new sensors w=
idens the spectrum of potential remote sensing application but also enables=
 the development of new methods able to deal with the complexity of the dat=
a. This statement is at the source of the team OBELIX (observation of the e=
nvironment by complex imagery), whose aim is the development of new tools a=
nd methods in order to deal with those complex images in an environmental c=
ontext.
Hierarchical image representations from Mathematical Morphology have recent=
ly shown their ability to produce a precise and compact description of sate=
llite images, thus improving scalability of efficient methods in remote sen=
sing. However, recognition processes based on these tree-based representati=
ons remain still very basic and do not rely on new machine learning paradig=
ms (active learning, on-line, semi-supervised etc.). Yet, new learning tech=
niques exist, leading to improved recognition rates, but at the price of hi=
gh computational cost.
Learning on complex data is becoming more and more important, with the deve=
lopment of new methods that explicitly take into account the structure of t=
he data. Among them, we can cite learning on graphs, which sums up relation=
s between entities of interest, while modeling the structure of the data. H=
owever, learning on hierarchical representations as trees has not still rec=
eived a lot of interest, and is the novelty of the project. The objective o=
f this PhD thesis is twofold. In one hand, it is about how complex images (=
in high dimension, with a temporal and heterogeneous nature) can be represe=
nted by a multiscale model (e.g. with hyperconnection representation). On t=
he other hand, we will study how such representations can lead to advanced =
classification schemes. Expectations are first methodological, with the dev=
elopment of new tools to learn from hierarchical representations, but also =
of applicative nature on environmental remote sensing, in the context of su=
stainable development=20
(e.g. study of the coastline dynamics).
Prof. S=E9bastien Lef=E8vre submitted the ASTERIX project (Space and time a=
nalysis for remote sensing of environment recognition in complex images) in=
side the ANR Jeunes Chercheurs 2013 call and the European STREP AMIRAL proj=
ect (Advances Multiscale Image Representation And Learning). The PhD candid=
ate could collaborate with a pluridisciplinary team of both projects (compu=
ter scientists, machine learning specialists, geomatic specialists, geograp=
hers) that associates researchers from UBS with teams from other french and=
 european cities. The support provided by MGDIS Company, software editor in=
 the field of decision aid for local communities, will be a lever to ensure=
 the technology transfer and the integration of the PhD results inside prod=
ucts developed for local stakeholders.
