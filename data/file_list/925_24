       Call for papers for a special issue in

International Journal of Computer Systems Science and Engineering IJCSSE
http://www.crlpublishing.co.uk/journal.asp?j=csse&s=Aims%20and%20Scope

Special issue on
Mobile Data Management: Models, Methodologies and Services

Guest Editors:
Franck Morvan, IRIT, Paul Sabatier University, France
Abdelkader Hameurlain, IRIT, Paul Sabatier University, France


The advent of mobile laptops, sensor and smart card combined to the
evolution of wireless networks providing higher bandwidth and better
connectivity generates new requirements for users. For example,
a user wishes to begin a transaction without connection to the
network, to locate the hotel the closest to him from the computer
embedded on his car, or to use a service on the web independently
of factors: time and place. The consideration of the constraints
bound to ultra portable laptops (e.g. screen size), to smart cards
(e.g. limited storage capacity), to the distribution and to the
heterogeneity of information sources spread on large-scale networks
raise numerous problems during the design of systems. These systems
have to adapt themselves to the changes of the mobile environment.
The objective of this special issue is to present recent research
works concerning mobility in data management. Original papers
preferably but not limited to the following topics are welcome:

-    Metadata management
-    Data management in wireless sensor networks
-    Query languages
-    Location dependent query processing
-    Continuous query
-    Embedded data management
-    Data placement
-    Load balancing
-    Caching and replication
-    Mobile transactions
-    Disconnected operations
-    Data and process migration
-    Mobile query optimization
-    Indexation of mobile objects
-    Security
-    Performance evaluation and benchmarking
-    Mobile applications and experiences
