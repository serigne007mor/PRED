SCOPE AND TOPICS
============
The Fifth IEEE International Conference on RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN 
INFORMATION SCIENCE (RCIS) aims at providing an international forum for 
scientists, researchers, engineers and developers from a wide range of 
information science areas. While presenting research findings and 
state-of-art solutions, you are especially invited to share experiences 
on new research challenges in these main topics:

- Information System Engineering
- Business applications
- Database and Information System Integration
- Decision Information Systems
- Data Management
- Internet computing
- Knowledge Management
- Knowledge Discovery from Data
- Management applications
- Spatial Information Systems

Each of these topics areas is expanded on the conference web page 
(http://www.rcis-conf.com/call.php). Papers may address one or more of 
the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. 
Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fitin 
one of the conference main topics.


CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS AND BEST PAPERS
=============================
Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review for 
other conferences or journals will not be considered for publications at 
RCIS╒11. Authors are invited to submit papers in English using the paper 
format indicated below. Each submitted paper will have to be associated 
to one of the four following categories:

Technical solution papers present solutions that are novel or 
significantly improve existing solutions. A technical solution paper 
must include a preliminary validation of the proposed solution. Results 
must be stated clearly enough so that it is possible to validate them in 
later research.

Evaluation papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate 
proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e. by empirical studies, 
experiments, case studies, simulations, mathematical proofs, etc. The 
research method must be sound and appropriate.

Industrial practice and experience papers present problems or challenges 
encountered in practice, relate success and failure stories, or report 
on industrial practice. The practice must be clearly described and its 
context must be given.

Doctoral Papers are papers submitted by doctoral students only and are 
related to research work in progress.

************************************************************************


PAPER SUBMISSION
============
By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of 
them will register to the conference and present the paper.
Submitted papers will be evaluated by the RCIS 2011 Program Committee 
based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of 
exposition.
A "blind" paper evaluation method will be used. Therefore authors are 
kindly requested to produce and provide the full paper, without any 
reference to the authors.
The manuscript must contain, in its first page, the paper title, the 
paper category (Technical solution, Evaluation, Industrial or Doctoral), 
an abstract and a list of keywords but no names or contact details are 
to be included in any part of the file. Notification of paper 
acceptance/rejection will be sent by email.

Papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference 
will be published in IEEE Proceedings.
************************************************************************
Authors of papers that obtain the highest marks in the reviewing process 
will be invited to submit an extended version to a journal.
************************************************************************

Since Proceedings will be published with the IEEE Conference 
Publications Program through IEEE Xplore digital library, paper 
submissions must be formatted using the IEEE 2-column format (see 
Conference Templates  
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 


They should be limited to a maximum of 12 pages and be submitted in PDF 
format.
Please use the IEEE PDF eXpress tool (Conference ID: RCIS2011x) to 
convert your source file into IEEE Xplore compliant PDF File or to check 
if your own PDF file is IEEE Xplore compliant. IEEE PDF eXpress is a 
free service to IEEE conferences, allowing their authors to make IEEE 
Xplore-compatible PDFs (Conversion function) or to check PDFs that 
authors have made themselves for IEEE Xplore compatibility (PDF Check 
function).
It is important to note that submitting a file to IEEE PDF eXpress is 
only for creation of a compliant PDF file, you must still submit your 
final paper through online submission.
