=3D=3D=3D

** 1st International Workshop on Machine Learning in Software Engineering *=
*
in conjunction with ECML PKDD 2021
13th September, virtual conference


Scope
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Software engineering (SE) is about methodologies and techniques for
building high quality software systems. However, modern software
systems are becoming larger and more complex. Many of these systems
are distributed and contain hundreds or even thousands of individual
components that interact and communicate with each other through
various interfaces. This not only complicates the process of software
development, but also makes it more difficult and challenging to
ensure their correctness and reliability.

On the other hand, recent advances and novel machine learning (ML)
techniques deals with the development of methods that can
automatically or semi-automatically infer models from data. Although,
ML has already revolutionized numerous domains such as image
recognition, translation and healthcare, it is not yet extensively
used in SE. The increasing demand and interest in SE to improve
quality, reliability, cost-effectiveness and the ability to solve
complex problems has led researchers to explore the potential and
applicability of ML in SE.  For example, some emerging applications of
ML for SE are source code generation from requirements, automatically
proving the correctness of software specifications, providing
intelligent assistance to developers, and automating the software
development process with planning and resource management.  Moreover,
SE techniques and methodologies can be used to improve the ML process
(SE for ML).

The interest in ML in SE is evident from the exponential growth in the
number of articles published on ML for SE in recent years. This
workshop aims at bringing together the SE, ML and data mining
community to work toward novel ML for SE methods, their underlying
assumptions and guarantees to allow researchers, practitioners and
software engineers to identify and adopt the suitable ML methods to
improve SE processes and software itself.

The workshop is open to research papers from academia and the
industry. The workshop works on a model of call for papers, but also
feature a small number of invited papers from top researchers in the
field.

This workshop provides a place for researchers from two different
fields to bring together both theoretical developments and
applications of ML in SE. ML can provide new methods and insights to
address various challenges in SE and vice versa. The main goal is to
identify and share ideas on new research directions for how SE can
benefit from ML that could ultimately generate profound impact on the
SE society. Collaboration of people from ML and SE fields will offer
new insights and results that can be applied in some of the research
lines under the umbrella of the main ECML PKDD 2021 conference.

The topics of interest for Machine Learning in Software Engineering
(MLiSE) include, but are not limited to following:

- Automated software design and development,
- ML-based tools in SE such as for software integrated development environm=
ent,
- ML in software project management, planning and scheduling,
- Software effort estimation and fault prediction with ML,
- Mining software repositories, particularly mining mobile application
repositories,
- Intelligent investigation of software reliability, testing and security,
- Formal approaches in ML,
- Search-based SE,
- Application of ML in software testing,
- Nature-inspired and evolutionary algorithms in SE
- Application of ML in theorem proving and model checking,
- ML to predict software refactoring,
- Process mining and design pattern mining,
- Detection of duplicate code,
- ML for software vulnerability analysis,
- Discovering knowledge in source code and artifacts using pattern
mining and other data mining techniques,
- New SE practices for ML model development
- Case studies and real-world applications of the above,
