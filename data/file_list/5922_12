The Nature of Writing. A Theory of Grapholinguistics

Dimitrios Meletis

Grapholinguistics and Its Applications, vol. 3, Brest: Fluxus Editions, =
novembre 2020, 472 pages.

OpenEdition, downloadable from: http://www.fluxus-editions.fr/gla3.php

Writing is an eclectic phenomenon whose many facets are studied by the =
young interdisciplinary field of grapholinguistics. Linguistically, =
writing is a system of graphic marks that relate to language. Under the =
lens of processing, it is a method of producing and perceiving =
utterances with our hands, eyes, and brains. And from a communication =
theoretical and sociolinguistic perspective, it is an utterly personal =
medium that allows users not only to convey messages to others but also =
to associate themselves with cultures or ideologies. These perspectives =
must merge to become the foundation of a functional theory of =
grapholinguistics that aims not only to describe how writing systems are =
built but to explain why they are built that way. Starting with a =
unified framework that allows the description of all types of writing =
systems with comparative concepts (such as grapheme) and moving towards =
the incorporation of evidence from disciplines such as psycholinguistics =
and sociolinguistics to arrive at explanations, this book establishes =
the cornerstones of such a functional theory of writing. The Nature of =
Writing is a collection of ideas about writing, a status report about =
relevant research, a discovery of desiderata, and a new perspective. It =
is a start, but most importantly, it is an invitation.

Dimitrios Meletis is a linguist specializing in grapholinguistics. He =
holds a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Graz and is currently =
a postdoc researcher at the University of Zurich. The motivation behind =
his grapholinguistic research is his fascination for typography and =
calligraphy on the one hand and his love for language on the other. He =
has written a book on graphetics (2015) and articles on central =
grapholinguistic concepts including the grapheme (2019) and allography =
(2020).

The history of linguistics is largely a history of misreadings,
of failed communication between authors and readers,
exacerbated by the illusion that communication has successfully =
occurred.     (John E. Joseph)
