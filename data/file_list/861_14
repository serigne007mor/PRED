International Workshop
Dynamic Virtual Communities: From Connectivity to Information Society
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the frame of the IEEE International Conference on Digital Information 
Management (ICDIM'07)

October 29, 2007
INSA of LYON, FRANCE

AIMS & SCOPE:
 From sensor networks to virtual organisations, from physical to virtual 
worlds, the concept of community appears as a key feature for the 
development of tomorrows’ applications in the information society. The 
workshop will consist of animated, constructive, and inter-disciplinary 
discussions about technologies, methodologies, and tools for the 
engineering of applications for the collection, management, exchange and 
use of information within communities.
The workshop places an emphasis on practical engineering challenges and 
applications. It also welcomes theoretical, philosophical, and empirical 
contributions. Prospective papers about new paradigms, theories, models 
are also appreciated.
We solicit short papers (max. 10 pages) and extended abstracts (2-5 
pages) of ongoing work, recent results and position statements that 
encompass the workshop's core themes. Papers will be peer-reviewed and 
will be selected according to their significance to the scope of the 
workshop, their quality of presentation and their ability to stimulate 
discussions. All the papers must respect the IEEE Computer Society's 
2-column conference proceedings format.

PUBLICATION:
Accepted papers will be published by IEEE and fully indexed by IEEE 
Xplore. Papers should not exceed 10 pages.
High quality papers will be considered for further review and inclusion 
in a special issue of the INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB BASED COMMUNITIES 
(IJWBC).

IMPORTANT DATES:
• Submission Deadline: June 30th, 2007
• Acceptance/Rejection Notification: July 30th 2007
