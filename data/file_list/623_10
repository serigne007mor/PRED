				    CALL FOR PAPERS

			The 2006 International Conference on
		SIGNAL-IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET- BASED SYSTEMS 				(SITIS06)

			Sponsored by IEEE and ACM (approval pending)

			December 17th - December 21st 2006
				The MARCO POLO Hotel
				Hammamet, Tunisia
			http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/sitis


The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used
to represent,
share and process information in various forms, ranging from signal,
image, and multimedia
data to traditional data and semi-structured data found in the web.
SITIS 2006 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on
research activities
centered on three main tracks.
________________________________________________________________

The focus of the first track "Information Management & Retrieval
Technologies" (IMRT)
is on the emerging modeling, representation and retrieval techniques
that take into account
the amount, type and diversity of information accessible in distributed
computing environment.
The main topics of Interest include:

- Data Semantics
- Spatial Information Systems and Applications
- Multimedia and application
- Information security.
___________________________________________________________________


The second track "Web-Based Information Technologies & Distributed
Systems" (WITDS) is devoted to
emerging and novel concepts, architectures and methodologies for
creating interconnected environments
in which information can be exchanged easily, tasks can be processed
collaboratively, and communities
of users with similarly interests can be formed while addressing
security threats that are present
more than ever before. The main topics of Interest include:

- Information System Interoperability
- Emergent semantics
- Agent-based systems
- Distributed, Parallel, GRID, P2P, Mobile information management
- Web-Centric Systems
_____________________________________________________________________

The third track "Signal & Image Technologies" (SIT) focuses on recent
developments in digital signal
processing and pays particular attention to evolutions in audiovisual
signal processing, analysis, coding
and authentication, and retrieval techniques. The main topics of
Interest include:

- Image Processing and Analysis
- Image/Video Coding and Authentication
- Signal processing
- Applications
_____________________________________________________________________


Submissions must be in electronic form as PDF or PS files and should be
uploaded through the SITIS 2006 Web site.
Submissions should be 3000-4000 words long (approx. 8-12 double-space
printed pages).
Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 qualified reviewers.
Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact,
originality, technical soundness,
and quality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions
that take strong or challenging positions
on important emergent topics. At least one author should attend the
conference to present the paper.

Tutorial and Workshop proposals should be submitted to
sitis@u-bourgogne.fr.
