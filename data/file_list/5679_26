                             Let us dig into the geophysics of data!

OBJECTIVE

The ADAGEO Summit and Thematic School aim at promoting scientific =
discussion and practical actions and projects that can address =
geosciences problems through data science solutions. Thereby, the =
activities and interaction in this event will build a scientific and =
practitioners=E2=80=99 transdisciplinary community the will develop a =
novel way of doing geosciences.


OVERVIEW
Massive data production is a critical aspect of experimental sciences. =
We have experienced exponential growth in data availability in the past =
decade, and it has not been different for geoscience. Examples of =
geoscientific data include any physical observable related to the energy =
industry, mining, monitoring hazardous areas (e.g., effects of mining in =
populated areas), etc. Nowadays, with the relative facility and lowering =
the cost to acquire data =E2=80=93 even in continuous mode =E2=80=93 the =
data processing to exploit their value is a challenge. Also, it requires =
expertise in data maintenance and processing, data analysis, and the =
design of experiments of target domains for which data will provide =
insight and knowledge.

Traditional analysis in the area using these computing and data services =
revolves around the creation of physics-based models. These are =
developed and executed by geoscience professionals with a deep =
understanding of geology, geophysics, engineering, reservoir dynamics, =
production technology, and economics, among other things. Data managers =
support these geoscience professionals to ensure high-quality data that =
powers the decision-making process. In contexts with a high data =
density, significant actions are now being invested in advanced =
analytical techniques such as machine learning to augment decisions =
traditionally made exclusively by geoscientists and engineers.

Many scientists and companies believe that they can generate fresh =
insight, reduce decision cycle times, and steal a march on their =
competition by automating the search for patterns and relationships in =
their data. Therefore, geophysics and data science, including =
algorithms, mathematical models, and computing, must converge for =
developing experiments for obtaining insight and foresight about the =
observations contained in data collections. Furthermore, experiments =
represent best practices for addressing problems and questions on =
geophysics that must be treated as data and knowledge to be shared and =
reused by scientists and practitioners.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
* Statistical methods to investigate & unveil new geophysical data =
patterns=20
answer open problems lead to further research questions

* Unveil new geophysical data patterns, answer open problems, lead to =
new research questions

* Parallelizing algorithms for processing geophysical data in reasonable =
times


LECTURES & KEYNOTES
* Scalable Machine Learning
* Machine Learning Automation
* Geophysics for dummies
* Data Science Platforms: how to set data science experiments at =
different scales
* Experiments reproducibility
* The what, where and when of the space-time cubes
* Data Science Current Status and Trends
* Real-time detection & nucleation of small earthquakes in Stable South =
America

EXCITING CHALLENGES
* Get together, trivia and working time with couches (every day)
* Data Science for Geophysics: demo fest
* Awards to the best challenges solutions!
