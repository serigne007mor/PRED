                          (CRiSIS 2008)

The Internet has become essential for the exchange of information. Many user
groups from different backgrounds and with different objectives depend on it
to perform their daily tasks. Various activities are carried out via
the Internet: between companies (B2B), between businesses and consumers (B2=
C),
or between individuals who create their own virtual communities.
Moreover, many companies are interconnecting their Information Technologies
systems, including SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems,
directly or indirectly to the Internet. At the same time, the use of the=20
Internet
is facing increasing risks regarding safety, reliability, privacy and=20
security,
in particular due to vulnerabilities induced by the increasing complexity of
Internet-related applications. Therefore, new security and dependability
mechanisms and techniques should be deployed to achieve an assurance level
acceptable for critical domains such as transportation, health, defence,
banking, critical infrastructures, etc.

In this context, dependability, security and privacy become a priority
that should be addressed by all actors in research, industry, services
and governments. These issues will be studied from different view
points: research results, practical experiment and deployment,
applications and case studies, etc. Different application domains
are concerned: telemedicine, e-government, e-learning, e-commerce,
critical infrastructures, etc. CRiSIS=922008 will be a forum for the
participants to broaden professional contacts and for technical
discussions on security and dependability issues.


The topics addressed by CRiSIS=922008 range from the analysis of faults,
risks, attacks and vulnerabilities to system survivability and adaptability,
passing through security policies and models, security and dependability
mechanisms and privacy enhancing technologies. The authors are invited to
submit research results as well as practical experiments or deployment=20
reports.
Industrial papers about applications or case studies are also welcomed in=
=20
different domains.
