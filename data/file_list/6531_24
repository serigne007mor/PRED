AIM AND SCOPE

The "European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and
Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases" (ECML/PKDD) includes
a PhD session on machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases
and related application domains.  The objective of the session is
to provide an environment for students to exchange in an interactive
atmosphere their ideas and experiences with peers and to get
constructive feedback from senior researchers in machine learning,
data mining and related areas.

The topics for discussion will be ideas of students and their ongoing
work in preparation of their PhD dissertations and their interests in
machine learning and data mining. The target audience for the
session is mainly PhD students, their advisors, and interested
researchers and attendees of ECML/PKDD. During the PhD session,
researchers with experience in supervising and examining PhD students
will be able to participate and provide feedback and advice
to participants. It will be an excellent opportunity for developing
person-to-person networks to the benefit of the community and PhD
students in their future careers.


CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite PhD students (PhD in progress or defended not earlier
than 31st December 2013) interested in machine learning and/or
knowledge discovery in databases, to submit papers on all aspects
of machine learning, knowledge discovery and data mining, including
real-world applications. Research fields in which machine learning
and data mining benefit from cross-fertilization are welcome.

The submissions need to propose research ideas that are mature
enough to be presented as a paper and whose content can evolve
to become a substantial part of a PhD dissertation. The work may be
in progress. Papers submitted to the PhD session may include the
following items:
Motivation, problem description
Background and related work (including key references)
Novelty and significance relative to the state of the art
Approach, data, methods and proposed experiments
Results obtained and work in progress
Specific research issues for discussion at the PhD session

The first author must be a PhD student or a Masters student with
a concrete PhD research idea. Co-authors may include the research
advisors, committee members and other collaborators as needed.

Papers submitted to ECML/PKDD 2014 PhD session will be peer-reviewed.
Accepted papers will be presented in the special PhD session at
ECML/PKDD 2014 and will be published in the session proceedings
which will be available through the conference website.
The PhD student must register for the conference and give
an oral presentation at the PhD session.


SUBMISSION

The papers must be written in English and formatted according to
the Springer LNAI guidelines. Authors instructions and style files
can be downloaded at: http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
The maximum length of papers is 10 pages in this format.

All aspects of the submission and notification process are handled
online through the conference CMT submission system
(https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ECMLPKDD2014/), select from the menu
the PhD track.
