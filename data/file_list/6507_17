ECML Workshop  -   “Neural Connectomics: From Imaging to Connectivity”
September 15, 2014 - Nancy, France


_*Description: *_

Understanding the brain structure and some of its alterations caused by 
disease, is key to accompany research on the treatment of epilepsy and 
Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropathologies, as well as gaining 
understanding of the general functioning of the brain and its learning 
capabilities. At the neural level, recovering the exact wiring of the 
brain (connectome) including nearly 100 billion neurons, having on 
average 7000 synaptic connections to other neurons, is a daunting task.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers in machine 
learning and neuroscience to discuss progress and remaining challenges 
in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. We aim to attract machine 
learning and computer vision specialists interested in learning about a 
new problem, as well as computational neuroscientists who may be 
interested in modeling connectivity data. We will discuss also the 
results of the First ChaLearn Neural Connectomics Challenge.

_*Topics of interest to the workshop include, but are not limited to: *_

•    building connectomes from EM data
•    building connectomes from fMRI data
•    building connectomes from neurophysiology data
•    bridging neuroanatomy and neurophysiology
•    connectomics and learning
•    neuroimaging technology advances
•    network reconstruction algorithms
•    causality in time series
•    feature selection vs. causal discovery
•    generative vs. discriminative modeling
•    sharing data
•    sharing code
•    organizing new challenges
•    establishing ground truth, benchmarking
•    quantitative metrics of evaluation
•    theoretical understanding

_*Important dates:*_
o    Paper submission:                           June 20, 2014
o    Notification of acceptance:              July 05, 2014
o    Camera-ready:                                 July 25, 2014
o    ECML  Workshop:              September 15, 2014


_*Important - Submission Guidelines:*_

We encourage contributions in any of these areas. We welcome 2-page 
short-form submissions and 6-page long-form submissions. Submissions 
should be formatted using JMLR Workshop and Proceedings format, style 
files for which are available at: 
http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/jmlr.html. We 
also encourage submissions of previously-published material that is 
closely related to the workshop topic (for presentation only).

Everybody can attend the workshop even if he does not participate in the 
challenge (http://connectomics.chalearn.org/). Challenge participants 
are encouraged to contribute a paper on their results and also submit 
papers for presentation on the topics of the workshop.

The papers have to be submitted via Easy Chair: 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ncw2014
