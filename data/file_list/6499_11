Introduction

=============

Data driven scientific discovery approach has already been agreed to be 
an important emerging paradigm for computing in areas including social, 
service, Internet of Things (or sensor networks), and cloud. Under this 
paradigm, Big Data is the core that drives new researches in many areas, 
from environmental to social. There are many new scientific challenges 
when facing this big data phenomenon, ranging from capture, creation, 
storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. The complication 
here is not just the storage, I/O, query, and performance, but also the 
integration across heterogeneous, interdependent complex data resources 
for real-time decision-making, collaboration, and ultimately value 
co-creation. Data sciences encompass the larger areas of data analytics, 
machine learning and managing big data. Data analytics has become 
essential to glean some understanding from large data sets and convert 
data into actionable intelligence. With the rapid growth in the volumes 
of data available to enterprises, Government and on the web, automated 
techniques for analyzing the data have become essential.

The 2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced 
Analytics (DSAA'2014) aims to provide a premier forum that brings 
together researchers, industry practitioners, as well as potential users 
of big data and advanced analytics, to promote collaborations and 
exchange of ideas and practices, discuss new opportunities, and 
investigate the best actionable analytics framework for wide range of 
applications. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works 
on data science and advanced analytics along with their application to 
real life situations.
