Research engineer position

Conservatoire National des Arts et M=C3=A9tiers, CEDRIC Laboratory, =
Paris, France

Context
This research engineer position takes place within the EU H2020 SAFECARE =
project (SAFEguard of Critical heAlth infrastructure). The aim of this =
project is to provide solutions that will improve both physical and =
cyber security in a cost-effective way. Also, it will promote new =
technologies and novel approaches to enhance threat prevention, threat =
detection, incident response and mitigation of impacts.
Nowadays, the lines between physical and cyber worlds are increasingly =
blurred. Almost all equipment is connected to the Internet, and physical =
intrusion might affect cyber security. Threats cannot be analyzed =
separately as physical or cyber, and therefore it is critical to develop =
an integrated approach in order to fight against such a combination of =
threats.
One of the main objectives of SAFECARE is to propose a model that =
formalizes the cascading effect of an incident in the context of =
e-health. Based on this model, it will be possible to anticipate the =
potential impacts of cyber and physical incidents, not only on building =
infrastructures (power supply, air cooling, etc.), but also on IT =
systems and medical devices. The model will be based on an ontology that =
describes the domain knowledge.

The recruited person will be in charge of developing an innovative =
ontology-based threat propagation module for e-health. He or she will =
participate in the project monitoring and meetings with partners.

The position tasks include:
- Ontological modeling of the SAFECARE core ontology: this task defines =
a conceptual model and core ontology for capturing essentially static =
knowledge. The conceptual model and core ontology will be refined in =
each of the main project phases.
- Ontological modeling of the impact management: this task extends the =
core ontology mentioned above with the definition of concepts that are =
essential to impact propagation computation. It also provides indicators =
to help deciding about the suitable countermeasures to face attacks =
consequences.
- Definition and implementation of IPM rules: this task defines and =
creates the IPM (impact propagation module) rules used to automatically =
infer the impact propagation.
- Continuous integration of results: this task consists of the =
continuous integration of the developed components into the global =
cyber-physical security solutions.
- Test and demonstration: this task tests the developed prototype on a =
test platform in order to validate that it is operational and tests its =
interconnections with other solutions before implementation in real =
operational environments.
- Dissemination and communication: this task disseminates and exploits =
the project results throughout the health-user and scientific community.


Requirements
Candidates will hold a Master degree or a PhD degree in Computer science =
or a related field and is able to combine theoretical and practical =
aspects in his/her work. Fluent English communication, ability to work =
in an international network of collaborators, and software technology =
skills are fundamental requirements. The candidate should have a =
background in at least one of the following fields:
- Semantic web technologies
- Knowledge representation
- Logic, AI, automated reasoning, or related subfields
It would be a plus if the candidate has a background in cyber security =
field.
Full stack developing skills are required.

Duration:
18 months, starting as soon as possible.
