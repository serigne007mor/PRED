Software engineer for a French-German Internet-of-Things research project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of a two year R&D project, UPMC/LIP6 and Fraunhofer
IOSB are hiring a Software Engineer for participating in the
validation, extension and promotion of an existing Internet-of-Things
platform for new SMART environment applications.

In this position, you will be responsible for concrete system design
and overall structure of software to be engineered and realized. Your
work is a balanced mix of broad strategic thinking on technology
trends and concepts, deep subject matter expertise in one of the above
mentioned application areas and the technical implementation of
innovative concepts in the context of smart city and/or smart
manufacturing technologies.

Your workplace will be at the LIP6 laboratory located on the Jussieu
campus in the heart of the Paris Quartier Latin and you will also
collaborate with your colleagues at the Fraunhofer IOSB Institute
situated in Karlsruhe, Germany.


Your contributions :

- Conducting applied research in highly innovative IT-projects
- Conceiving and prototyping software solutions


Your profile:

- Strong software engineering skills and practical experience in
   programming (preferably Java) and in at least one of the following
   subjects: databases, knowledge management, semantic web
   technologies, ontology design.

- Capacity to understand new concepts and to work independently.

- Experience in the design, development, and delivery of software
   applications and services with rich UI/presentation layers across a
   variety of technology platforms and frameworks in the embedded,
   mobile, desktop, web, and/or cloud spaces.  Master degree in science
   and/or engineering, is required (applicants with a Bachelor's degree
   would require respective professional experience)

- Fluent in English and French, German is a plus.

Employment and location:

You will receive a 2 year contract (CDD) with Université Pierre et
Marie Curie (http://www.upmc.fr/ ). Contract prolongation is planned
but depends on project progress and performance.  The workplace is the
LIP6 laboratory located on the Jussieu campus in the heart of the
Quartier Latin.  Salary depends on qualification and professional
experience.


The Research Institutions:

The Laboratory of Computer Sciences, Paris 6 (LIP6, http://www.lip6.fr)
with a staff of 470 people including 170 permanent researchers, 250
PhD students, Postdocs, engineers and administrative employees is
today one of the most important centers of Computer Science in
France. LIP6 is part of the Université Pierre et Marie Curie and as a
department of CNRS (UMR 7606), it is also linked to the INS2I
(Institut des sciences de l'information et de leurs interactions).
The LIP6 laboratory is composed of 20 research teams structured into 7
departments which cover a wide spectrum of computer science domains:
scientific computing, decision making, optimization problems in
artificial intelligence and operational research, databases and
machine learning, networks and systems, systems on chips, complex
systems.

The Fraunhofer-Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image
Exploitation (IOSB, http://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de ) has 440 permanent
employees, of which 282 are scientists or engineers. IOSB is situated
in Karlsruhe, Germany and develops innovative concepts and application
solutions in information technology in various business units such as
automation, energy, water and environment, defense, security and
automated visual inspection. Fourteen departments and one research
group, which acts as a link to the Chair of Interactive Real-Time
Systems of the Institute for Anthropomatics at the Faculty for
Information Technology at the Karlsruhe Technical University,
represent the variety of competences at the IOSB.
