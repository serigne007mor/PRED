Recently, combining mathematical programming, constraint programming, 
metaheuristics to solve complex problems have received considerable 
interest in the field of combinatorial optimization. Many difficult 
problems in a large variety of domains, including bioinformatics, 
telecommunications, logistics, engineering, business, etc. have been 
tackled successfully using cooperative methods.

The available methods for combinatorial optimization can roughly be 
classified into two main categories: exact and heuristics. Among the 
exact mathematical programming methods are branch-and-bound (B&B), 
dynamic programming, lagrangian relaxation based methods, and linear and 
integer programming based methods, such as branch-and-cut, 
branch-and-price, and branch-and-cut and price.

Metaheuristics include among others, evolutionary algorithms, tabu 
search, scatter search, variable neighborhood search, colony 
optimization, iterated local search, and simulated annealing.

The main goal of this special issue is to report on research that 
produces state-of-the-art on cooperative optimization to solve 
non-trivial problems in a wide spectrum of applications. Of particular 
interest are papers in the following topics:

- Cooperative models of constraint programming and mathematical 
programming techniques

- Hybrid models of metaheuristics and mathematical programming

- Hybrid models of metaheuristics and constraint programming

- Parallel and distributed cooperative methods for optimization

- Application of cooperative models for solving differents real-world 
applications: bioinformatics, telecommunications, transportation and 
logistics, engineering design, etc.

The proposed timeline for the special issue is as follows:

*Submission of papers: July 30th, 2006*

*Notification of first review: Déc 15th, 2006*

*Final manuscripts sent: Fev 10st, 2007*

* *

We encourage authors to send submissions via email in an electronic form 
(PDF, Postscript) to talbi@lifl.fr . The format style of the EJOR
