The 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2012) will be held from October 29 to November 2, 2012 in Maui, Hawaii, USA. CIKM is a top-tier ACM conference in the areas of information retrieval, knowledge management and database. Since 1992, it has successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from the three communities. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. In CIKM 2012, we will continue the tradition of promoting collaboration among multiple areas, through keynote presentations, oral paper presentations, poster sessions, workshops, demonstrations, and an industry event.
