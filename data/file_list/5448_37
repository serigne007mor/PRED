*Context*

In recent years, deep learning has been applied successfully and achieved
state-of-the-art performance in a variety of domains, such as image
analysis. Despite this success, deep learning models remain hard to analyze
data and understand what knowledge is represented in them, and how they
generate decisions.

Deep Learning (DL) meets Natural Language Processing (NLP) to solve human
language problems for further applications, such as information extraction,
machine translation, search, and summarization. Previous works have atteste=
d
the positive impact of domain knowledge on data analysis and vice versa,
for example pre-processing data, searching data, redundancy and
inconsistency data, knowledge engineering, domain concepts, and
relationships extraction, etc. Ontology is a structured knowledge
representation that facilitates data access (data sharing and reuse) and
assists the DL process as well. DL meets recent ontologies and tries to
model data representations with many layers of non-linear transformations.

The combination of DL, ontologies, and NLP might be beneficial for
different tasks:

   -

   Deep Learning for Ontologies: ontology population, ontology extension,
   ontology learning, ontology alignment, and integration,
   -

   Ontologies for Deep Learning: semantic graph embeddings, latent semantic
   representation, hybrid embeddings (symbolic and semantic representations=
),
   -

   Deep Learning for NLP: summarization, translation, named entity
   recognition, question answering, document classification, etc.
   -

   NLP for Deep Learning: parsing (part-of-speech tagging), tokenization,
   sentence detection, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, semantic
   dependency parsing, etc.

*Objective*

This workshop aims at demonstrating recent and future advances in semantic
rich deep learning by using Semantic Web and NLP techniques which can
reduce the semantic gap between the data, applications, machine learning
process, in order to obtain semantic-aware approaches. In addition, the
goal of this workshop is to bring together an area for experts from
industry, science, and academia to exchange ideas and discuss the results
of ongoing research in natural language processing, structured knowledge, a=
nd
deep learning approaches.
