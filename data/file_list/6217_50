ESANN 2014 - Special Session : Incremental learning and novelty detection m=
ethods=20

The development of dynamic information analysis methods, like incremental c=
lustering, concept drift management and novelty detection techniques, is be=
coming a central concern in a bunch of applications whose main goal is to d=
eal with information which is varying over time.
These applications relate themselves to very various and highly strategic d=
omains, including web mining, social network analysis, adaptive information=
 retrieval, anomaly or intrusion detection, process control and management =
recommender systems, technological and scientific survey, and even genomic =
information analysis, in bioinformatics.
This special session aims to offer a meeting opportunity for academics and =
industry-related researchers, belonging to the various communities of Compu=
tational Intelligence, Machine Learning, Experimental Design and Data Minin=
g to discuss new areas of incremental clustering, concept drift management =
and novelty detection and on their application to analysis of time varying =
information of various natures. The set of proposed incremental techniques =
includes, but is not limited to:=20

 novelty detection algorithms and techniques=20
 adaptive hierarchical, k-means or density based methods=20
 adaptive neural methods and associated Hebbian learning techniques=20
 multiview diachronic approaches=20
 probabilistic approaches for evolving data=20
 graph partitioning methods and incremental clustering approaches based on =
attributed graphs=20
 incremental clustering approaches based on swarm intelligence and genetic =
algorithms=20
 evolving classifier ensemble techniques=20
 dynamic variable selection techniques=20
 visualization methods for evolving data analysis results=20
