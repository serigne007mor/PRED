====
Research and Innovation Track

The Research and Innovation track at SEMANTiCS welcomes papers on novel 
scientific research and/or innovations relevant to the topics of the 
conference. Submissions must be original and must not have been 
submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must follow the guidelines 
given in the author instructions, including references and optional 
appendices. Each submission will be reviewed by several PC members who 
will judge it based on its innovativeness, appropriateness, and impact 
of results in terms of effectiveness at solving real problems.

Important Dates:
Abstract Submission Deadline:    April 23, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Paper Submission Deadline:        April 30, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Notification of Acceptance:         June 10, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Camera-Ready Paper:         July 29, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

Author instructions: Reviews will be carried out in a single-blind mode. 
Long papers should have a maximum length of 15 pages and short papers of 
6 pages. Submissions should follow the guidelines of the Springer LNCS 
format.

====
Posters and Demos Track

The Posters and Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in 
progress, late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller 
contributions in all fields related to the Semantic Web and Linked Data 
in a broader sense. These include submissions on innovative applications 
with impact on end users, such as demos of solutions that users may test 
or that are yet in the conceptual phase but are worth discussing, and 
also applications or pieces of code that may attract developers and 
potential research or business partners.

Important Dates (Posters & Demos)
Paper Submission Deadline:    June 10, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Notification of Acceptance:     July 8, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Camera-Ready Paper:         July 22, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

Author instructions: Proceedings will be published via CEUR Workshop 
proceedings and should follow the guidelines of the Springer LNCS format.

====
Industry and Use Case Track

Focusing strongly on industry needs and ground breaking technology 
trends SEMANTICS invites presentations on enterprise solutions that deal 
with semantic processing of data and/or information. A special focus of 
Semantics 2019 will be on the convergence of machine learning techniques 
and knowledge graphs. Additional topics of interest are Enterprise 
Knowledge Graphs, Semantic AI & Machine Learning, Enterprise Data 
Integration, Linked Data & Data Publishing, Semantic Search, 
Recommendation Services, Thesaurus and/or Ontology Management, Text 
Mining, Data Mining and any related fields. All submissions should have 
a strong focus on real-world applications beyond the prototypical stage 
and demonstrate the power of semantic systems!

Important Dates:
Proposal Deadline:    May 27, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Notification of Acceptance: June 10, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

A detailed Call for Industry and Use Case Presentations will be 
available soon.

====
Workshops and Tutorials

Workshops and Tutorials at SEMANTiCS 2018 allow your organisation or 
project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased 
visibility. The workshops and tutorials will provide a forum for 
presenting widely recognised contributions and findings to a diverse and 
knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a 
dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a 
closed format for research and commercial project consortia meetings.

Important Dates for Workshops:
Workshop Proposals:         March 4, 2019 (23:59 Hawaii Time)
Notification of Acceptance:         March 18, 2019 (23:59 Hawaii Time)

Important Dates for Tutorials (and other meetings, e.g. seminars, 
show-cases, etc., without call for papers):
Submission deadline:         May 6, 2019 (23:59 Hawaii Time)
Notifications:                 May 13, 2019 (23:59 Hawaii Time)

Vocabulary Innovation Award #VIA

Bootstrap your vocabulary project: At the Vocabulary Innovation Award 
you can present your ideas, early stage or camera-ready vocabularies in 
order to showcase your work, find the right people and get the 
discussion going. For this event, we provide both, an academic and 
industry track. We use a broad definition of what a vocabulary is. For 
instance, ontologies, classification schemes, thesauri, taxonomies, 
subject heading and metadata schemes, whichever their format, be it RDF 
or not, are all welcome. More details will follow.
Proposal Deadline:    May 20, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
Notification of Acceptance: June 03, 2019 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
