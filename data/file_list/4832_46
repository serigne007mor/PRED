Subject: [liste-egc] ICFCA 2019 Call for papers (deadline extension)

[Apologies for cross-postings]

Due to multiple requests, the paper submission deadline for ICFCA 2019 =
has been EXTENDED to February 3rd 2019.=20
The abstract deadline is to extended to January 25th.

> Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980=E2=80=99s from attempts to =
restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication =
between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since =
its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research =
field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a =
rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge =
processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge =
management and discovery. The ICFCA conference series aims at bringing =
together researchers and practitioners working on theoretical or applied =
aspects of Formal Concept Analysis within major related areas such as =
Mathematics and Computer and Information Sciences and their diverse =
applications to fields like Software Engineering, Linguistics, =
Environment, Life and Social Sciences, etc. All accepted submissions =
will be refereed, and the conference proceedings will be published by =
Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.

> Main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
>=20
> =E2=80=A2	Fundamental aspects of FCA:  FCA theory, Lattice theory, =
lattice drawing, philosophical foundations, algorithms and complexity =
theory
> =E2=80=A2	Bridging FCA to information sciences and artificial =
intelligence: FCA and logic (e.g., semantic web, description logics), =
FCA and conceptual structures (e.g., concept graphs, knowledge spaces), =
FCA and data analysis (e.g., hierarchical classification, data =
organization), FCA and data mining (e.g., pattern mining), FCA and =
information retrieval (e.g. exploratory search, navigation, querying), =
FCA and machine learning (e.g., learning with hypothesis, feature =
selection),  FCA and database theory (e.g., dependencies, rules, data =
cubes), FCA and software engineering, FCA and morphological mathematics
> =E2=80=A2	Understanding, modelling real-world data and phenomena =
with FCA: Analysis of =E2=80=9Cbig data=E2=80=9D with FCA (e.g., =
sampling, parallel computing), analysis of social 	networks and =
their dynamics, applications for scientific data analysis (e.g., in =
biology, ecology or health care), applications for sensors data and user =
interactions traces, other FCA applications
