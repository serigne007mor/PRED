In conjunction with ISWC 2021, Oct 24th - Oct 28th, Virtual Conference

=
--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------=20
Workshop Overview=20
=
--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------=20
Over the past years there has been a rapid growth in the use and the =
importance of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) along with their application to =
many important tasks. KGs are large networks of real-world entities =
described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to =
each other. On the other hand, Deep Learning methods have also become an =
important area of research, achieving some important breakthroughs in =
various research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) =
and Image Recognition.

In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical =
that the communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP =
join their forces in order to develop more effective algorithms and =
applications. This workshop, in the wake of other similar efforts at =
previous Semantic Web conferences such as ESWC2018, ESWC2019, and =
ISWC2018, aims to reinforce the relationships between these communities =
and foster interdisciplinary research in the areas of KG, Deep Learning, =
and Natural Language Processing. Moreover, this will be the third =
workshop edition at ESWC aiming at replicating the success of last year =
which attracted several submissions and attendees.=20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------=20
Topics of interest for the second workshop on Deep Learning for =
Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Technologies, include but are not limited =
to:

New approaches for combining Deep Learning and Knowledge Graphs
Methods for generating Knowledge Graph (node) embeddings
Scalability issues
Temporal Knowledge Graph Embeddings
Novel approaches=20
Applications of combining Deep Learning and Knowledge Graphs
Recommender Systems leveraging Knowledge Graphs
Link Prediction and completing KGs
Ontology Learning and Matching exploiting Knowledge Graph-Based =
Embeddings
Knowledge Graph-Based Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Understanding/Machine Reading
Question Answering exploiting Knowledge Graphs and Deep Learning
Approximate query answering on knowledge graphs
Entity Linking
Trend Prediction based on Knowledge Graphs Embeddings
Domain Specific Knowledge Graphs (e.g., Scholarly, Biomedical, Musical)
Applying knowledge graph embeddings to real world scenarios.

Papers must comply with the LNCS style and can fall in one of the =
following categories:
Full research papers (8-10 pages)
Short research papers (4-6 pages)
Position papers (2 pages)
Lightning talks (1 page abstract)

The papers can be submitted through Open Review: =
https://openreview.net/group?id=3Dswsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2021/Workshop/=
DL4KG=20

Reviewing Policy:
During the review stage, papers and reviews will be hidden for the =
public
The reviewers can indicate whether they want their review to remain =
anonymous, or not
Upon acceptance of a paper, the paper and the reviews become public and =
commenting is enabled
Rejected papers will remain invisible to the public (including their =
reviews)

Accepted papers (after blind review of at least 3 experts) will be =
published by CEUR=E2=80=93WS. The best paper (according to the =
reviewers=E2=80=99 rate) will be published within the main conference =
proceedings.

At least one of the authors of the accepted papers must register for the =
workshop (pre-conference only option) to be included into the workshop =
proceedings.
=20
Because of the COVID pandemic, the workshop will be carried out remotely =
according to the guidelines that will be provided by ISWC 2021.
