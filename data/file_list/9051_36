Subject: [liste-egc] Post-doc offer: Community Assistant for Smart Cities,
 Sept 2011


Post-doc offer: Community Assistant for Smart Cities
Keywords: Multi-Agents Systems, Semantic Web, Virtual Communities, 
Context-awareness.

In the context of collaboration between LaHC, TSE (Université Jean 
Monnet) and ENSM-SE (Ecole des Mines), we are inviting applications for 
a 12-months post-doc position in Saint Etienne, France.

Main points of the position:
- Scientific domains: multi-agent systems, Semantic Web, context 
awareness, knowledge modelling and exchange, mobile programming (iOS, 
android …). While we cannot expect an applicant to be proficient in all 
these fields, we expect solid background for the domains in which he/she 
is comfortable with.
- Use case domain: Smart Cities.
- Dead line for application: June 15th, 2011.
- Expected starting date: September or October 2011.

The aim of the project is to contribute to the design and development of 
a context-aware virtual community management platform. The application 
domain is Smart City in which users are provided with smart devices, 
which contain a community assistant (multi-agent) and acting under 
his/her control for knowledge exchanges. Exchanges appear in the frame 
of so-called virtual communities.
In this project, the post-doc candidate will be in charge of programming 
the community assistant and its related programs for supporting 
communities’ creation/evolution and exchanges. He/she will also be 
involved in writing publication(s) of his/her works, and helping to put 
together project application(s) in the continuation of his/her work.

Candidates must have demonstrable interest and expertise in the 
scientific domains. A good level in English is essential. Applicants 
should have or be in the process of getting a *PhD's degree in Computer 
Science*.
