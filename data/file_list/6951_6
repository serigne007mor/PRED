Second Call for Papers: 20th International Conference on Application of Nat=
ural Language to Information Systems (NLDB'15)

Conference website: http://nldb2015.org/

NLDB 2015 invites researchers from academia and industry to submit papers f=
or oral or poster presentations on recent, unpublished research that addres=
ses theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures for applie=
d and integrated NLP, resources for applied NLP, and other aspects of NLP, =
as well as survey and discussion papers.

Special Track: Semantic and Cognitive Computing
-----------------------------------------------
For the 20th edition of NLDB, we especially solicit submissions for our spe=
cial track: Natural Language and its connection to Semantic and Cognitive C=
omputing. Semantic computing aims at connecting the meaning of the user=92s=
 need with semantics of content in a multidisciplinary fashion. Cognitive C=
omputing systems naturally interact with people and learn over time. While =
natural language understanding is necessary for semantic understanding and =
interacting with a cognitive system (e.g. a question answering system or a =
search application), it is an open question how to leverage direct or indir=
ect user feedback for improving the overall system's output, but also for i=
mproving the natural language processing stack and evolving the system's kn=
owledge representations. Further, the interaction of natural language and f=
ormalized knowledge repositories is attained differently in the literature.=
  Papers for the special track especially focus on the adaptivity and the c=
ombination of NL and knowledge processing systems: domain adaptation, adapt=
ation over time, adaptivity and user feedback, wisdom of the crowds, inform=
ation fusion from heterogeneous sources, incremental/online machine learnin=
g. We especially encourage submission of survey and discussion papers for t=
he special track.=20

NLDB'15 Topics
--------------
Further, we encourage submissions on the following topics:

* Applications of NLP in Information Systems: Multilingual Information Syst=
ems, NLP in Requirement Engineering, NLP in Knowledge Management, Semantic =
Data Integration and Data Cleaning.

* Social Media and Web Data: Corpus analysis, Language identification, Text=
 normalization, Robust NLP for social media, Text classification, Informati=
on Extraction and Sentiment Analysis for social media.

* Semantic Web Open Linked Data: Ontology Learning and Alignment, Populatin=
g ontologies, Querying Ontologies and linked data, Semantic tagging and cla=
ssification, Ontology-driven NLP.

* Question Answering (QA): NL interfaces to databases, QA using web data, m=
ulti-lingual QA, Non-factoid QA (how/why/opinion questions, lists), geograp=
hical QA, QA corpora and training sets.

* Natural language and Ubiquitous Computing: Pervasive Computing, Embedded,=
 Robotic and Mobile Applications.

* Natural Language in Conceptual Modeling: Analysis of Natural Language Des=
criptions, Terminological Ontologies, Consistency Checking, Metadata Creati=
on and Harvesting, Ontology-driven Systems Integration, Ontology Management.

* NLP Applications: Business Intelligence, Subjectivity and Sentiment Analy=

Submission information
----------------------
All accepted papers will be included in Springer proceedings of the confere=
nce. We solicit four types of papers:
* Long papers: Up to 12 pages, plus references. Long papers should describe=
 unpublished, complete research
* Short papers: Up to 6 pages, plus references. Short papers describe a com=
parative evaluation of existing works, a negative result, or consist of a s=
urvey, discussion or position paper.=20=20
* Poster and Demo papers: Up to 4 pages, plus references: Poster/Demo paper=
s describe a small focused result, a negative result, or a late-breaking re=
sult, or a description of a system that can be demonstrated on-site at the =
conference.=20
