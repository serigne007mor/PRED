Technology Innovation Institute (TII) is a global independent research and
development institute. Today, we are building a community of
multi-disciplinary scientists and researchers from across the globe,
transforming problems and roadblocks into pioneering research and
technology prototypes that help move society ahead.

At TII, we help society to overcome its biggest hurdles through a rigorous
approach to scientific discovery and inquiry, using state-of-the-art
facilities and collaboration with leading international institutions. Our
rigorous discovery and inquiry-based approach helps to forge new and
disruptive breakthroughs in advanced materials, autonomous robotics,
cryptography, cyber security, directed energy, quantum computing and secure
systems.
