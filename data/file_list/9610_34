Subject: [liste-egc] First CfP 3rd Int. Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced
 Information Retrieval (BIR 2016) @ECIR2016

=3D=3D First Call for Papers =3D=3D
You are invited to participate in the upcoming 3rd international =
workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR 2016), to =
be held as part of the 38th European Conference on Information Retrieval =
(ECIR).

=3D=3D=3D Aim of the Workshop =3D=3D=3D
In this third workshop we aim to engage with the IR community about =
possible links to bibliometrics and complex network theory which also =
explores networks of scholarly communication (see papers and =
presentations of the first workshop =
<http://www.gesis.org/en/events/events-archive/conferences/ecirworkshop201=
4/> and second workshop =
<http://www.gesis.org/en/events/events-archive/conferences/ecirworkshop201=
5/>). Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance =
retrieval processes in digital libraries, yet they offer value-added =
effects for users. Our interests include information retrieval, =
information seeking, science modelling, network analysis, and digital =
libraries. The goal is to apply insights from bibliometrics, =
scientometrics, and informetrics to concrete practical problems of =
information retrieval and browsing.
=20
Retrieval evaluations have shown that simple text-based retrieval =
methods scale up well but do not progress. Traditional retrieval has =
reached a high level in terms of measures like precision and recall, but =
scientists and scholars still face challenges present since the early =
days of digital libraries: mismatches between search terms and indexing =
terms, overload from result sets that are too large and complex, and the =
drawbacks of text-based relevance rankings. Therefore we will focus on =
statistical modelling and corresponding visualizations of the evolving =
science system. Such analyses have revealed not only the fundamental =
laws of Bradford and Lotka, but also network structures and dynamic =
mechanisms in scientific production. Statistical models of scholarly =
activities are increasingly used to evaluate specialties, to forecast =
and discover research trends, and to shape science policy. Their use as =
tools in navigating scientific information in public digital libraries =
is a promising but still relatively new development. We will explore how =
statistical modelling of scholarship can improve retrieval services for =
specific communities, as well as for large, cross-domain collections. =
Some of these techniques are already used in working systems but not =
well integrated in larger scholarly IR environments.
The availability of new IR test collections that contain citation and =
bibliographic information like the iSearch collection or the ACL =
collection could deliver enough ground to interest (again) the IR =
community in these kind of bibliographic systems. The long-term research =
goal is to develop and evaluate new approaches based on informetrics and =
bibliometrics.
=20
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and =
practitioners from different domains, such as information retrieval, =
information seeking, science modelling, bibliometrics, scientometrics, =
network analysis, digital libraries, and approaches to visualize search =
and retrieval to move toward a deeper understanding of this research =
challenge.
=20
This workshop is also informed by an ongoing COST Action TD1210 =
KnowEscape. http://www.knowescape.org
=20
=3D=3D=3D Workshop Topics =3D=3D=3D
To support the previously described goals the workshop topics include =
(but are not limited to) the following:
- IR for digital libraries and scientific information portals
- IR for scientific domains, e.g. social sciences, life sciences etc.
- Information Seeking Behaviour
- Bibliometrics, citation analysis and network analysis for IR
- Query expansion and relevance feedback approaches
- Science Modelling (both formal and empirical)
- Task based user modelling, interaction, and personalisation
- (Long-term) Evaluation methods and test collection design
- Collaborative information handling and information sharing
- Classification, categorisation and clustering approaches
- Information extraction (including topic detection, entity and relation =
extraction)
- Recommendations based on explicit and implicit user feedback
- (Social) Book Search
=20
We especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work =
as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple =
themes directly are especially welcome.

=3D=3D=3D Submission Details =3D=3D=3D
All submissions must be written in English following Springer LNCS =
author guidelines (4 to 8 pages) and should be submitted as PDF files to =
EasyChair. All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent =
reviewers. Please be aware of the fact that at least one author per =
paper needs to register for the workshop and attend the workshop to =
present the work. In case of no-show the paper (even if accepted) will =
be deleted from the proceedings AND from the program.

Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop =
proceedings publication service (ISSN 1613-0073) - This way the =
proceedings will be permanently available and citable (digital =
persistent identifiers and long term preservation).
