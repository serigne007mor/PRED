 Geospatial Humanities

Dear colleagues,

We are thrilled to announce the 7th edition of the ACM SIGSPATIAL =
International Workshop on Geospatial Humanities on November 13, 2023 in =
Hamburg, Germany. Co-located with the main SIGSPATIAL conference, we =
welcome submissions that explore spatial technologies in humanities =
research.

We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from computer =
science, geographical information sciences, and the humanities who are =
interested in novel combinations of spatial methods and technologies =
with humanistic documents. Our goal is to select papers that foster =
discussion on how to generate new knowledge in scientific and humanistic =
disciplines. Participants will demonstrate their contributions and =
explore how modern GIS and other technologies can inform, and be =
transformed by, the humanities.

Paper submission deadline: September 1, 2023
Decisions to authors: September 25, 2023
Camera ready versions: October 10, 2023
Workshop (in person in Hamburg): November 13, 2023

About the workshop: =
https://ludovicmoncla.github.io/sigspatial-geohumanities-2023/

CFP and submission information: =
https://ludovicmoncla.github.io/sigspatial-geohumanities-2023/call-for-pap=
ers.html

Details: The workshop invites contributions on the following topics, as =
well as other research related to the Spatial Humanities:
=E2=80=A2 Gazetteer development (e.g., models, data conflation, semantic =
technologies, etc.)
=E2=80=A2 Ontologies and linked data for modeling geohistorical data
=E2=80=A2 Historical and literary geographical information systems
=E2=80=A2 Spatio-temporal network analysis in the humanities
=E2=80=A2 Text geo-parsing and other NLP techniques for geographical =
text analysis
=E2=80=A2 Deep learning techniques for the spatial humanities
=E2=80=A2 Novel approaches for the analysis of vague and imaginary place
=E2=80=A2 Spatial simulation in the humanities (e.g., cellular automata =
and agent-based models)
=E2=80=A2 Spatial and spatio-temporal analysis of humanities data
=E2=80=A2 Visualization and cartographic representations
=E2=80=A2 Handling vague and imprecise historical spatio-temporal data
=E2=80=A2 Creating new spatial datasets from historical materials (maps, =
aerial photography, postal or other directories, newspapers, etc.) using =
state-of-the art methods
=E2=80=A2 Novel approaches for the analysis of humanistic spatial data =
at scale
=E2=80=A2 Applications of the aforementioned techniques

Contributions should be submitted in the form of long papers (i.e., up =
to 10 pages in PDF), reporting on relatively mature research results, or =
alternatively in the form of short papers (i.e., up to 4 pages in PDF), =
reporting on more speculative and early stage research that may =
nonetheless stimulate discussion at the workshop.=20

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the programme =
committee and accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital =
Library.

Please note: At least one author per accepted contribution will be =
required to register for the main ACM SIGSPATIAL conference (which then =
includes workshop registration), as well as to attend the workshop on =
November 13th to present the work.=20

Best,
Bruno Martins
