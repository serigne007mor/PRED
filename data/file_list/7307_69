Call for Papers DISCOVERY SCIENCE 2012
(http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/ds-2012/index.html)

The 15th International Conference on Discovery Science (DS-2012) will be 
held in Lyon, France, on 29-31 October 2012.

DS-2012 will be collocated with ALT-2012, the 23rd International 
Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory. The two conferences will be 
held in parallel, and will share their invited talks.

Keynote speakers:
     * Luc De Raedt, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
       Declarative modeling for machine learning and data mining

     * Toon Calders, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands
       Frequent pattern mining: a decade of research

     * Shai Shalev-Shwartz, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel
       Title TBA

Invited tutorials:
     * Gilbert Ritschard, University of Geneva, Switzerland
       Exploring sequential data

     * Pascal Massart, Université de Paris-Sud, France
       Title TBA

Publication:
     * Traditionally the proceedings of DS series  appear in the
       Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence Series
       by Springer-Verlag.

Journal special issue:
     * Journal on data semantics (Springer Verlag)


DS scope:
DS 2012 provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of 
new ideas among researchers working in the area of Discovery Science. 
The scope of the conference includes the development and analysis of 
methods for automatic scientific knowledge discovery, machine learning, 
intelligent data analysis, theory of learning, as well as their 
application to knowledge discovery. Very welcome are papers that focus 
on dynamic and evolving data, models and structures.

Important dates are:
     * Full paper submission:   17th May, 2012 (tentative)
     * Author notification:     8th July, 2012 (tentative)
     * Camera-ready papers due: 20th July, 2012 (tentative)
     * Conference:              29-31 Oct. 2012

The DS-2012 Website is:
http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/ds-2012/index.html

Submissions:
We invite submissions of research papers addressing all aspects of 
discovery science. We particularly welcome contributions that discuss 
the application of data analysis, data mining and other support 
techniques for scientific discovery including, but not limited to, 
biomedical, astronomical and other physics domains.

Papers may contain up to fifteen (15) pages and must be formatted 
according to the layout supplied by Springer-Verlag for the Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science series.
Submitted papers may not have appeared in or be under consideration  for 
another workshop, conference or a journal, nor may they be under  review 
or submitted to another forum during the DS 2012 review process.

An excellent student paper will be selected to receive the Carl Smith 
Award. The award carries a scholarship prize of 555 euros.

Submission Topics
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
     * Logic and philosophy of scientific discovery
     * Knowledge discovery, machine learning and statistical methods
     * Ubiquitous Knowledge Discovery
     * Data Streams, Evolving Data and Models
     * Change Detection and Model Maintenance
     * Active Knowledge Discovery
     * Learning from Text and web mining
     * Declarative approaches for data mining
     * Information extraction from scientific literature
     * Knowledge discovery from heterogeneous, unstructured and 
multimedia data
     * Knowledge discovery in network and link data
     * Knowledge discovery in social networks
     * Data and knowledge visualization
     * Spatial/Temporal Data
     * Mining graphs and structured data
     * Planning to Learn
     * Knowledge Transfer
     * Computational Creativity
     * Human-machine interaction for knowledge discovery and management
     * Biomedical knowledge discovery, analysis of micro-array and gene 
  deletion data
     * Machine Learning for High-Performance Computing, Grid and Cloud 
Computing
     * Applications of the above techniques to natural or social sciences
