EKAW 2010 workshop
REUSE AND ADAPTATION OF ONTOLOGIES AND TERMINOLOGIES
http://www-limbio.smbh.univ-paris13.fr/ReuseOnto-EKAW2010
 
 
The workshop will take place during EKAW 2010, between October 11th  
and 15th, 2010 in Lisbon, Portugal
 
CONTACT
ReuseOnto-EKAW2010@listes.univ-paris13.fr
 
CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION
Thanks to progress performed by the knowledge engineering area,  
powerful methods for designing and use of ontologies are provided. As  
a result, the scientific and industrial communities have gained access  
to an increasing number of ontologies and terminologies. For instance,  
within the biomedical area, several dozens of orthogonal or generic  
ontologies and terminologies are currently available thanks to the OBO  
(Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) or UMLS initiatives: the  
objective is to make them interoperable and hence reusable.
The usage of an ontology or terminology is often characterized by  
several factors between which we would name: application, scientific  
or technical domain, language of data and of documents to be  
processed, user profile, etc. All of them influence the content and  
organization of the semantic resources (terminologies and ontologies).  
Exploitation of these resources in this original context ensures their  
optimal use and results.
We assume that reuse of such resources implies that at least one of  
the designing factors is modified: application, user, domain ...  
Hence, the reuse implies also that an adaptation of ontologies and  
terminologies is performed. This process appears to be necessary in  
order to guarantee an optimized exploitation of the reused ontologies  
and terminologies.
 
OBJECTIVES
Further to recent evolution of the knowledge engineering area and to  
emergence of new context related to the reuse and adaptation of  
ontologies and terminologies, several questions have arised and still  
arise. We propose to address them in this workshop and encourage  
submissions on topics related to questions such as:
- Which areas have developed and currently provide freely available  
ontologies and terminologies?
- Are these ontologies and terminologies specific to a given  
application, sub-domain or rather generic and descriptive of the area?
- At which extend the existing ontologies and terminologies may be reused?
- Whether the existing ontologies can be adapted to new purposes?
- Is their adaptation a suitable process?
- Is their adaptation less expensive than the designing of new ontologies?
- What knowledge elements can be reused: terms, concepts, relations,  
roles, definitions ...?
- Are terminologies more easily reusable than ontologies?
- What methods and principles should be exploited for the adaptation  
and reuse of the existing ontologies?
- How the mapping of ontologies may be helpful for their reuse?
- Which role play corpora in adaptation of terminologies and ontologies?
- Are Natural Language Processing methods helpful in the process of  
adaptation of terminologies and ontologies? If they are, which of them  
prove to be suitable?
- ...
This workshop may also be concerned with questions related to managing  
of the evolution of ontologies and their versioning and to analysis of  
evolution of their content (i.e., concept emergence, removal,  
abstraction or specialisation), especially when combined with  
questions cited above.
