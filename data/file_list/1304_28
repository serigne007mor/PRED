Scope and Topics
----------------
Organizations of different kinds, from structured companies up to social
networks or virtual communities, are becoming increasingly aware of the
need to collect, organize, mobilize, increase, in sum manage, the
knowledge characterizing their ability to stay alive, adapt and evolve
in a turbulent context. Knowledge Management (KM) is a keyword under
which different organizational and technological approaches to answer
this need are referred to, both in applied research and in the practices
of real organizations. KMIA aims to collect papers reporting on
experiences that are confronted with real situations and highlight
problems, requirements and solutions that are derived from those
experiences by taking into account the following perspectives:
- organizational strategies to enact and promote KM within
organizations, and their relation with the ICT technology
- various kinds of knowledge, application domains, organizational
structures, and their implication on KM
- methods and approaches for the design of KM solutions
- techniques and technologies for a sustainable KM (CSCW-based
approaches, web-based approaches, etc.)
- critical success factors for KM socio-technical solutions
- evaluation of KM applications in real situations
- lessons-learned in each phase of the KM application life-cycle, from
conception up to continuous adaptation
- critical comparison of technologies, field studies and strategies in KM
- any other perspective contributing to a better understanding of KM in
action
