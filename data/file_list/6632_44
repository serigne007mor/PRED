**********************


The goal of this track is to bring together researchers and practitioners b=
oth from the Academia and from the Industry working in the areas of Service=
-oriented and component-based software applications and architectures and a=
ddressing adaptation and reconfiguration issues. Different investigation to=
pics are involved, such as: CBSE, SOA, Functional and Non Functional (NF) r=
equirements (QoS, performance, resilience), monitoring, diagnosis, decision=
 and execution of adaptation and reconfiguration. Different research axes a=
re covered: concepts, methods, techniques, and tools to design, develop, de=
ploy and manage adaptive and reconfigurable software systems.

The development of composite services poses very interesting challenges con=
cerning their functional and NF requirements. On the one hand, a composite =
software system depends on the NF requirements of its constituting componen=
ts in order to provide a satisfactory service to the user. On the other han=
d, the main issues for the fulfillment of QoS and service level agreements =
(SLA) are concerned with performance variability. Indeed, the QoS may evolv=
e frequently, either because of internal changes or because of workload flu=
ctuations. The performance and the robustness of the composite software sys=
tem may be significantly improved by monitoring the execution of the compon=
ents and by flexibly reacting to degradation and anomalies in a timely fash=
ion.

The concept of adaptive and reconfigurable software systems has been introd=
uced in order to describe architectures which exhibit such properties. An a=
daptive and reconfigurable software system can repair itself if any executi=
on problems occur, in order to successfully complete its own execution, whi=
le respecting functional and NF agreements. In the design of an adaptive an=
d reconfigurable software system, several aspects have to be considered. Fo=
r instance, the system should be able to predict or to detect degradations =
and failures as soon as possible and to enact suitable recovery actions. Mo=
reover, different NF requirements service levels might be considered in ord=
er to complete the execution in case of failure.

TOPICS
For this track, contributions are devoted to functional and non functional =
adaptability and reconfiguration management in service-oriented and compone=
nt-based software systems. Specifically, the relevant topics include, but a=
re not limited to:
- Distributed and centralized collaborative solutions for the diagnosis and=
 repair of software systems
- Design for the diagnosability and repairability
- Collaborative Management of NF requirements (quality, security, robustnes=
s, availability)
- Monitoring simple and composite architectures, components and services
- Semantic (or analytic) architectural and behavioral models for monitoring=
 of software systems
- Dynamic reconfiguration of CB and SO architectures
- Collaborative planning and decision making
- Collaborative technologies for ensuring autonomic properties
- Predictive management of adaptability.
- Collaborative Management of autonomic properties
- Experiences in practical adaptive and reconfigurable CB and SO applicatio=
ns
- Tools and prototypes for managing adaptability of CB and SO applications

suring high quality.  Best papers in AROSA 2014 will be selected for submit=
tal in a special issue of the Journal of Systems and Software (http://www.j=
ournals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software/).
