                          Special Issue on Social Web Mining

Social network platforms (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Twitter) have been
drawing increasing attention from everyday users worldwide to research
communities and industries. For instance, it is reported that there
are more than 750 million active Facebook users, of which 50% log on
in any given day. The success of the social network platform provides
a wealth of information, which brings great opportunities for
e-Commerce, policy making, social media recommendations, and much more.
However, it can be challenging to model the social networks and make
predictions, given this prosperity of social networks leading to
information overload.

Social web mining aims at modeling social interactions (e.g., posting
and messaging in Facebook) and relationships (e.g., friendship in
Facebook, Followed / Following in Twitter, Friends / Family /
Acquaintances / Following in Google+), and then learning inductive
rules for predictions, which are carried out by leveraging the
information available via various social networks and recent advances
in machine learning and data mining. This special issue is aimed at
providing a forum to highlight the leading works from the data mining
and machine learning communities for making sense of social networks.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
-   Community detection
-   Crawling of social networks
-   Large scale graph mining
-   Multi-relational data mining
-   News/social media recommender systems
-   Preference learning and elicitation in social networks
-   Privacy protection in social networks
-   Sentiment analysis in social networks (e.g., opinion mining in Twitter)
