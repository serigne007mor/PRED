3. Scope

Data management in distributed systems and applications that require 
voluminous, distributed,
heterogeneous and dynamic data sources is the subject of many research. 
These research leaded,
principaly, in Cloud, Grid and Peer-to-Peer computing topics will make 
considerable impact on
large scale distributed data management. Today, these topics require 
more research in order to
raise still open challenges like scalability, elasticity, consistency, 
security and autonomic
data management.

The main objective of the annual international conference on data 
management in Cloud, Grid
and P2P Systems is to present the latest results in research and 
applications, to identify
new issues, and to shape future directions.
