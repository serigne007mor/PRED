CALL FOR PAPERS - Deadline extended to September 30, 2012

Special Issue of the Journal of Systems and Software on "Middleware for Mob=
ile Data Management"

Scope:

We are witnessing an explosion of technological advances in the field of mo=
bile computing, with an ever-increasing use of mobile devices, wireless com=
munication technology, and intelligent objects that provide continuous acce=
ss to data and services. Many applications and software systems are being d=
eveloped in this environment. However, the high heterogeneity of the device=
s' hardware and software, the wide range of communication options available=
 (3G, WiFi, Bluetooth, WAVE, etc.), the resource limitations (e.g., power),=
 and mobility itself make the development of appropriate software a difficu=
lt task. Therefore, the use of some middleware as a supporting platform and=
 abstraction mechanism could be of great help for developers. In this speci=
al issue, we plan to collect research related to the design and development=
 of middleware platforms and services that facilitate the development and d=
eployment of systems and software to manage data in mobile computing scenar=
ios. Research !
  areas of relevance include, but not only limited to, the following topics:

- Middleware for context-aware and location-based services.
- Middleware for pervasive computing.
- Middleware for mobile peer-to-peer systems.
- Middleware for vehicular networks.
- Middleware for sensor data management in mobile computing applications.
- Middleware for heterogeneous semantic data management in mobile computing.
- Middleware and system support to facilitate interoperability.
- Middleware for smart environments and ambient intelligence.
- Middleware to abstract from existing communication technologies.
- Middleware for the Internet of Things (IoT).
- Middleware for mobile cloud computing.
- Cyber foraging and mobile agent services and technology.
- Applications and systems as successful use cases of existing middleware.

In addition to regular research papers, this special issue welcomes survey =
papers on middleware for mobile data management. Besides, the guest editors=
 will contact well-known experts and invite them to submit vision/thought-p=
rovoking papers.

Important Dates:

Submission: September 30, 2012 (final)
Expected publication: 2013

Submission Guidelines:

All manuscripts and any supplementary material should be submitted through =
Elsevier Editorial System (EES). The authors must select "Special issue: Mi=
ddleware Mobile" when they reach the "Article Type" step in the submission =
process. The EES website is located at http://www.elsevier.com/locate/jss/.

Submission Format:

Submitted papers must be written in English and describe original research =
which is not published nor currently under review by other journals or conf=
erences. Manuscripts that extend published conference papers must have sign=
ificant additional novelty. Author guidelines for preparation of manuscript=
s can be found at http://www.elsevier.com/locate/jss/. For more information=
, please contact the Editor-in-Chief, Hans van Vliet (hans@cs.vu.nl).
