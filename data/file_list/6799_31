Presentation:

------------------

The TOTh conferences aim to bridge the gap between terminology and ontology
by highlighting the contributions that one makes to the other and by
opening up new perspectives for both theoretical and practical developments.


Terminology is about names for concepts and objects in a given subject
area, but it is also concerned with other units such as collocations,
lexical combinations or phraseologies in actual use, all of which are part
of specialized languages and discourse. The terminologist=92s job is to
design and produce terminological resources which can be used for a variety
of language-based activities : translation, corpus language planning,
teaching language for special purposes, etc.


The quality and the precision of specialised discourse is directly linked
to the relation between the way lexical items are ordered and the way
knowledge is organised: sufficient encouragement in itself for active
collaboration between terminologists, translators, lexicographers,
knowledge engineers and IT specialists.


Terminology and ontology share similar objectives in the way they approach
and describe reality. Ontologies, which come from knowledge engineering,
are now one of the most promising ways to model conceptual systems for
terminologies. Of the numerous applications to be found in the digital
world, ontologies are particularly useful to make terminologies operational
and ensure their applications in various roles : as translation tools, for
information and knowledge management, the semantic web, etc.


Terminology and ontology are both basically transdisciplinary in approach,
and both reach out to take on board practices and theories from many
different subject fields, in particular from linguistics, language for
special purposes, epistemology, artificial intelligence, information
sciences.




Target audience & Disciplines:

---------------------------------------


The TOTh conferences aim to bring together all those involved in LSP,
terminology and knowledge engineering and, more generally, all persons
interested in issues related to language and knowledge. They are designed
to be platforms of exchange and sharing where problems are outlined and
solutions and feedback provided, for both theoretical and applied
perspectives as well as for the new trends and perspectives of associated
disciplines: terminology, languages for special purposes, linguistics,
artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, information systems,
collaborative engineering, information sciences, documentation, etc.



Young Researcher Prize:

--------------------------------


Since 2011, a Young Researcher Prize is awarded by the Program committee
and bestowed on the winner during the Conference.



Conference topics (non exhaustive list):

 --------------------------------------------------



Linguistic approaches:


- language for special purposes, translation, language and terminology
planning, specialized multilingual communication,

- usage, variation, term collocations, lexical combination,

- terminological products: glossaries, dictionaries, thesauri,

- corpus processing and natural language processing: text mining,
extracting terms, extracting knowledge, corpus building, corpus aligning,

-creating and maintaining terminological resources, harmonizing terms and
concepts, importance and limitations of corpora,

- theories of meaning, semantics,

- validating the quality of data, the role of experts.




 Knowledge representation:


- terminological principles for building conceptual systems,

- ontology and knowledge representation: representation, building,
maintaining, aligning, merging,

-classification theory,

-information retrieval,

-mono- and multilingual thesauri, library science, records management,

-input from artificial intelligence, linguistics, epistemology, formal
systems (description logic for example).




 Applications:


- software environments; building and maintaining terminologies, thesauri,
dictionaries, ontologies,

- IT applications based on knowledge and terminology resources: semantic
web, computer aided translation, mono and multilingual content management
systems, specialized digital libraries, information retrieval,
classification, knowledge management, information systems,

- assessing acquisition and manipulation tools, standards in the field of
language and ontology resources.
