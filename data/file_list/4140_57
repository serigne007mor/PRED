====

SEMANTiCS 2023 is a major venue for research and industrial innovation 
and features a workshop and tutorial program addressing the diverse 
practical interests of its audience. This program is intended to offer a 
rich diversity of topics to conference attendees and local participants 
seeking to pick up new skills and stay up-to-date regarding the latest 
developments in the community. We encourage submissions of proposals on 
all topics in the general areas of SEMANTiCS 2023 and proposals bridging 
or introducing new perspectives in these areas. Workshops and tutorials 
may incorporate panel discussions, lightning talks, meetings, networking 
or hands-on sessions, hackathons and other practical formats where 
applicable. Rooms for business or project meetings are available upon 
request as well.

=Important Dates for Workshops=
* Proposals WS Deadline: March 07, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance: March 14, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

=Important Dates for Tutorials (and other meetings, e.g. seminars, 
show-cases, etc., without call for papers)=
* Proposals Tutorial Deadline: June 06, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance: June 20, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

Submission via Easychair on https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sem23

=Scope & Goals=
Workshops and tutorials at SEMANTiCS 2023 allow your organisation or 
project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased 
visibility. The workshops and tutorials will be announced on the 
SEMANTiCS website and they will be seen by all participants. SEMANTiCS 
2023 workshops and tutorials can be incubators for industrial and 
scientific communities that form and share a particular research and 
development agenda. They provide a forum for presenting contributions 
and findings to a diverse and knowledgeable community.
Furthermore, the event can be used as a dissemination activity in the 
scope of large research projects or as a closed format for 
research/commercial project consortia meetings.

=Setup and Requirements=
SEMANTiCS 2023 workshops and tutorials may be either half or full day 
long. Workshops and tutorials take place on the days before and/or after 
the main SEMANTiCS 2023 EU conference (20th, 21st, and/or 22nd of 
September 2023). Details will be communicated on time.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will be granted three free tickets 
(only for the workshop & tutorial day) for organization purposes or 
keynotes. Participants of workshops and tutorials will be charged a 
marginal fee to cover the basic costs.
Workshop and tutorials proposals must include the following information:

* outline of the themes and goals of the event, including a title and a 
brief abstract (less than 200 words) intended for the SEMANTiCS 2023 website
* a statement addressing why the event is important, why the event is 
timely, how it is relevant to SEMANTiCS 2023 and the field of semantic 
web. For the tutorials, why the presenters are qualified for a 
high-quality introduction of the topic
* related workshops and conferences, i.e., specifying if this is a 
continuation of a workshop series or is a new workshop to address an 
emerging issue. Please provide information about past versions of this 
workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and 
submission/acceptance counts, if available).
* a statement addressing the quality assurance criterion that will be 
used by the event organizers to select the papers for the workshops and 
the presenters for the tutorials (e.g., peer review or review/evaluation 
by event organizers). If a peer review process is chosen as a quality 
assurance criterion for the workshops, the organizers will be 
responsible for their own reviewing process. Workshop organizers will be 
responsible also for their own publicity (e.g., website, timelines and 
call for papers) and proceedings production.
* structure of the event and plans for generating and stimulating 
discussion; how will the interaction be organized in case of a hybrid event
* desired minimum and maximum number of event participants, expected 
number of participants, and (in case of previously held events) number 
of registered attendees and web site for previous editions of the event
* a description of the intended audience and the expected learning outcomes
* desired prerequisite knowledge of the audience
* proposed duration of the event (i.e., half or full day), different 
sessions if applicable (final time slot will be assigned in accordance 
with the SEMANTiCS program)
* any equipment, room capacity, or other logistic constraints
* full contact information of all organizers of the event and main 
contact person; a brief description of each organizer's background, 
including relevant past experience in organizing events
