Subject: [liste-egc] ECML/PKDD 2014 - Call for tutorial proposals

Apologies for multiple postings

C A L L  F O R  T U T O R I A L S

ECML/PKDD 2014: European Conference on Machine Learning and
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases

Nancy, France, September 15-19, 2014

http://www.ecmlpkdd2014.org/
-----------------------------------------------------------

The ECML-PKDD 2014 Organizing Committee invites proposals for half-day 
tutorials to be held on the first and last days of the conference, which 
will take place in Nancy, France from September 15th to 19th, 2014. 
Tutorials are intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to core 
techniques and areas of interest for the machine learning and the data 
mining community. We are interested in tutorials on established or 
emerging research topics in the areas above but we also welcome 
tutorials from related research fields or applications. The ideal 
tutorial should attract a wide audience. It should be broad enough to 
provide a basic introduction to the chosen research area, but it should 
also cover the most important topics in depth. Each tutorial should be 
well-focused so that its content can be covered in a half day slot (3h 
plus a 30-minute break). Proposals that exclusively focus on the 
presenter's own work or commercial demonstrations are strongly discouraged.

Tutorial slides will be made available online at the main ECML-PKDD 
server, although authors can provide them in additional websites as 
well. Tutorial speakers will be offered the possibility of a reduced or 
waived registration fee, depending on the number of speakers for the 
tutorial.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Submissions
-----------------------------------------------------------
The submissions should contain:
-- a title and an abstract of the tutorial.
-- a brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the 
ECML PKDD community (no more than 2 pages).
-- a brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial's 
core content can be covered in a 3 hours slot.
-- the names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of 
the tutorial instructors, including one-paragraph statement of their 
research interests and areas of expertise.
-- a list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same 
or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of 
the audience size.
-- a description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., 
internet access).

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text no 
later than March 7, 2014 to:tutorials@ecmlpkdd2014.org. The subject line 
should be: "ECML PKDD 2014: TUTORIAL PROPOSAL". The proponents will 
receive an email confirmation that their proposal has been received. If 
no confirmation arrives within 24 hours after sending the proposal, the 
proponents should contact the tutorial co-chairs again.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Proposal reviewing process
-----------------------------------------------------------

The proposal will be reviewed by the tutorial co-chairs, who may use the 
help of external reviewers, expert on the submission topics.
The features that will be evaluated are:
-- the interestingness for the ECML PKDD areas, which should result in a 
large audience;
-- the clarity of the tutorial, which should emerge from its description;
-- good organization as appearing from the outline;
-- the adequacy of the speakers, i.e., her/his background/experience in 
teaching the target topics; and
-- the ability to explain the topics to a large audience with 
heterogeneous background.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial speaker responsibilities
-----------------------------------------------------------
Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by March 28, 2014, and must 
then provide the revised abstracts (ASCII format) of their tutorials by 
April 4, 2014 for advertisement purposes in the conference website. 
Tutorial speakers must provide their tutorial materials (pdf format), at 
least containing copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography 
for the material covered in the tutorial, by September 1, 2014.

-----------------------------------------------------------
