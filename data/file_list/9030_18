The First International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 28 to 30 September 2011 in Óbidos -- Portugal. The main objective of our conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI'2011 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.
All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
Topics on interest include but not limited to:
  Models Engineering
* Design of General-purpose Modelling Languages and Related Standards

* Formal Modelling, Verification and Validation, Analysis, Testing
* Ontology Based Modelling, Role of Ontologies in Modelling Activities
* Model Manipulation
Data Engineering
* Data Integration, Interoperability
* Distributed, Parallel, Grid, Peer to Peer, Cloud Databases
* Data Warehouses and OLAP, Data Mining
* Database System Internals, Performance, Self-tuning  Benchmarking and Testing
* Database Security, Personalization, Recommendation
* Web Databases, Ontology Based Databases, PDMS
  Modeling for Data Management 
* New Models and Architectures for Databases and Data Warehouses
* Modeling and Quality of Data
* Modeling for Enhancing Sharing Data
* Models for Explicit and Implicit Semantics based Data Optimization
* Model Reification, Model Repositories
* Modeling Non Functional Properties of Systems
* Urbanization of Database Applications
Applications and tooling
* Industry transfer, case studies, experiences

PAPER SUBMISSION DETAILS
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices). Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages with the indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the paper is accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra page purchase commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
Duplicate submissions are not allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if it is submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already accepted to be published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require explicit consent from all listed authors.

LOCATION
Óbidos is a Medieval walled town where time has passed it by. Within the extensive walls there are narrow cobbled streets, houses painted white with blue or yellow trim, flower boxes and old lamp lights. There are many churches and chapels among the houses. The castle is located at the highest point. Once the wedding present of a queen, the preserved medieval town of Óbidos and the surrounding land was always the property of the queens of Portugal.  Encircled by a ring of medieval walls and crowned by the Moorish castle.  Inside the walls, which at sunset take on a golden coloring, one can sense a cheerful medieval ambience of winding streets, old whitewashed houses bordered with blue or yellow, Manueline embrasures and windows. Óbidos is located about 80 km north of Lisbon.          
Besides its material heritage of the past, Óbidos, a melting pot of historical tradition is still today one of the main jewels of the country. More information about Óbidos,http://bit.ly/obidos_information. Welcome to Óbidos!
Selected conference hotels are located inside the old fort walls.
Conference sessions will be organized along different municipal buildings inside the medieval wall ring, allowing to participants to enjoy the villa costumes.
