PhD studentship proposals
in the Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne (France)

3 full-time PhD students
in the domain of
Semantic Web, Linked data, Web Science

These positions are offered in the framework of the EU-funded Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie International Training Network WDAqua (Answering 
Questions using Web Data) <http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/%7Elangec/wdaqua/>.
_Notice: __Candidates must not have resided for more than 12 months in 
France in the 3 years before starting_.

== Essential Facts ==
Topics of the PhDs will cover the domains of provenance, trust, link 
discovery, data dynamicity and evolution, temporal information, named 
entity recognition, disambiguation, and reasoning.
The 3 PhD students will spend 3 years working in the WDAqua ITN (a total 
of 15 PhD students registered in the Universities of Bonn, Athens, 
Saint-Étienne, and Southampton). They will participate in an outstanding 
web science and data science training programme, and will have the 
chance to visit other partners.
The gross monthly salary (including all social security charges, before 
taxes) is about 3,110 € plus a mobility allowance of 600 €/month and, if 
applicable, a family allowance of 500 €/month.
Two of the positions will propose a dual degree with the University of 
Bonn, Germany.

== Timeline ==
27 February 2015: application deadline
March 2015: first job offers made to successful applicants
July 2015–June 2018: duration of a PhD in WDAqua

== Eligibility and application procedure ==
_Candidates must not have resided for more than 12 months in France in 
the 3 years before starting_. They must hold an MSc degree in computer 
science or a related field and be able to combine both theoretical and 
practical aspects in their work. Fluent English communication and a 
passion for developing modern software solutions are fundamental 
requirements. Command of French or German is a plus but not required. 
The candidates should have experience and commitment to work in team and 
on the forefront of research.

You will need to submit a CV, university transcripts, a motivation 
letter including a short research plan targeting some topics of the 
above list, two letters of recommendation, and English writing samples 
(e.g., prior publication or master thesis excerpt).

The Université Jean Monnet is an equal opportunities employer. 
Preference will be given to suitably qualified women or persons with 
disabilities, all other considerations being equal.

== Background ==
Smart infrastructures and citizens’ participation in the digital society 
are increasingly data-driven. Sharing, connecting, managing, analyzing 
and understanding data on the Web will enable better services for 
citizens, communities and industry. However, turning web data into 
intelligent and successful services for the public and private sector 
requires skilled web and data scientists, and it requires further 
research. WDAqua aims at advancing the state of the art by intertwining 
training, research and innovation efforts, centered on data-driven 
question answering. Question answering is immediately useful to a wide 
audience of end users, and we will demonstrate this in settings 
including e-commerce, public sector information, publishing and smart 
cities. Steps to answering a question are (1) understanding a spoken 
question, (2) analyzing the question’s text, (3) finding data to answer 
the question, and (4) presenting the answer(s). Every individual 
research project in WDAqua connects at least two of these steps.
