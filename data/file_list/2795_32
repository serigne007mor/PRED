PHD position at IRIT (Toulouse) funded by the ANR COST project (2019-2022)

Title: Deep models for task-based information retrieval

Keywords: information retrieval, deep sequential models, deep 
reinforcement learning

Advisors: Eric Gaussier (eric.gaussier@imag.fr), Karen Pinel-Sauvagnat 
(karen.pinel-sauvagant@irit.fr), Lynda Tamine-Lechani 
(lynda.lechani@irit.fr)

===============
Context
===============

While search systems today are very effective for simple look-up 
information tasks (fact-finding search), they are unable to guide users 
engaged in exploratory, multi-step and highly cognitive search tasks 
(e.g, diagnosis, human learning). Hence, paradoxically, while we 
consider information search nowadays to be ’natural’ and ’easy’, search 
systems are not yet able to provide adequate support for achieving a 
wide range of real-life work complex search tasks[1]. In the CoST 
project https://www.irit.fr/COST/ (funded by ANR 2019-2022), we envision 
a shift from search engines to task completion engines by dynamically 
assisting users in making the optimal decisions, empowering them to 
achieve multi-step complex search tasks. While most of previous work 
rely on query-aware models and techniques to structure the session 
context and model search satisfaction [2,3,4] at the query level, we 
rather attempt to design task-aware IR models to make task-level 
satisfaction predictions.
===================================

PhD
===================================
This PhD will be focussed on applying neural approaches for task-based 
information retrieval. Based on the findings that have raised from 
previous works about the effectiveness of seq2seg models to capture 
reformulation patterns for the next query prediction task [4,5], we 
envision new end-to-end network architectures that make possible to 
account for sequences of sub-tasks.  We will also explore end-to-end 
learning for task satisfaction prediction based on deep reinforcement 
learning that goes beyond query-level relevance. The candidate will 
investigate the modelling, the deployment and evaluation of search 
assistance techniques (eg., query suggestion) and ranking models using 
deep neural networks architectures.  The evaluation of the resulting 
systems will be carried out using both public benchmarks (eg., TREC 
Tasks, TREC session, AOL dataset) as well as laboratory-built datasets 
built within the CoST project.
- Starting and duration: September 2019, 36 months
- Skills: Background in information retrieval and machine learning would 
be greatly appreciated but not mandatory
