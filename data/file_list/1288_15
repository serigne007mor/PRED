Description
**********************

The International Conference on Soft Computing as Transdisciplinary Science and
Technology (CSTST'08) brings together international soft computational
intelligence researchers, developers, practitioners, and users.
The aim of CSTST (previously called WSTST) is to serve as a forum to present

CSTST'08 invites authors to submit their original and unpublished work that
demonstrates current research in all areas of soft computing, as well as
proposals
for workshops, industrial presentations, demonstrations, and tutorials.

This edition is dedicated to commemorate the memory of Prof. Yasuhiko Dote,
Founding Chair of WSTST series of meetings.

The papers can be theoretical, practical and application oriented on the
following themes (but not limited to):

* Information and Data Management
* Intelligent Hybrid Systems
* Fusion of Soft and Hard Computing
* Data and Web Mining
* Decision Support Systems
* Natural Language Processing
* Intelligent Agent-based Systems, Cognitive and Reactive Distributed AI Systems
* Internet Modeling
* Multimedia Information Systems
* Information Retrieval
* Human-Computer Interface
* XML-based Languages
* Security and Access Control
* Information Content Security
* Mobile, Ad Hoc and Sensor Network Management

       o Chemicals, pharmaceuticals and materials
       o Environment engineering


Paper submission
*******************

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF files and should be uploaded
using the conference website (http://sigappfr.acm.org/cstst08/).
Full paper submissions should be in ACM format with a limit of 6 pages.
Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 independent reviewers of the PC.

Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originality,
