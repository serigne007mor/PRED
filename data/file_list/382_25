*INTRODUCTION

*Nowadays, information workers (individuals or professionals) are facing 
a lot of information sources (intranet/internet...). The challenge is to 
find relevant information within the huge amount of available 
information within these numerous sources. Adaptive or Personalized 
approaches tend to help users during this task. Besides these "solitary" 
approaches, evolutions of such approaches can be seen through systems 
that take into account a group (formal or informal) of users in order to 
improve search access and retrieval: Collaborative and Social 
Information Retrieval and Access systems. One of the main challenges of 
such approaches is the way users and communities are modeled and the way 
these models are exploited to improve the user's satisfaction. A variety 
of techniques have been adopted to address this challenge: context 
acquisition, community model, community of practice building... Research 
in these areas suggests an alternative promising approach in helping 
users to find relevant information.
User modeling for Collaborative and Social Information Retrieval and 
Access refers to a family of techniques concerning the model of user's 
information needs, relationships, behavior or context and their 
exploitation in order to improve the relevance of information offered to 
users.
Collaborative and Social Information Retrieval and Access: Techniques 
for Improved User Modeling presents current state-of-the-art and 
developments in this area and also includes case studies, challenges and 
trends. Contributors will have the opportunity to inform and educate 
academics, researchers, information retrieval product managers and 
software developers, librarians and students in the area of information 
systems.


*TOPICS

*Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Models (profile, context, user and community needs and behavior, 
Social information seeking)
* User context acquisition
* Mechanisms for personalization
* Folksonomies, tagging and other collaboration-based information 
retrieval systems
* Social navigation processes and metaphors for searching information
* Collaborative browsing
* Collaborative querying
* Adapted content delivery
* Cooperative software agents for information retrieval
* Collaborative filtering and recommender systems
* Evaluation of adaptive systems, algorithms and interfaces
* Social informatics
* Social networks and information retrieval
* Architecture for personalized retrieval and access
* Adaptive information retrieval and access
* Personalization techniques
* Usability in adapted information retrieval and access
* Applications and case studies
* Trends and challenges
 
*SUBMISSION INFORMATION

*Potential contributors are invited to submit a 3-5 pages chapter 
proposal by 15 October 2007 detailing the background, motivations and 
structure of the proposed chapter. All inquiries can be sent 
electronically (PDF/RTF/DOC files). Authors of accepted proposals will 
be notified by 30 November 2007 on the status of their proposals and 
sent chapter organizational guidelines. Full chapters are due on 20 
February 2008 and should be at least 8,500-10,000 words in length. All 
submitted chapters will be reviewed on a three-blind review basis. Final 
revised manuscripts are due on 15 May 2008.
The book is scheduled to be published by IGI Global (formerly Idea Group 
Inc.), publisher of the IGI Publishing (Idea Group Publishing), 
Information Science Publishing, IRM Press, CyberTech Publishing and 
Information Science Reference (formerly Idea Group Reference) imprints, 
in early 2009.
