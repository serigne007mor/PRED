Subject: [liste-egc] International Workshop on Process-Aware Logistics
 Systems (PALS)



===================================================================
Call for Papers -
1st International Workshop on Process-Aware Logistics Systems (PALS)
http://events.it-sudparis.eu/pals/

August 29th, 2011, Clermont-Ferrand, France,
In conjunction with BPM’2011
http://bpm2011.isima.fr/
===================================================================
Aim and Scope
This workshop deals with problems related to the design and optimization 
of global logistics systems, from a business process management perspective.

It is dedicated to exploring and mastering the tools needed for 
operating, reconfiguring and, in general, making decisions within 
logistics-based systems, in order to provide the customers and system 
users with the greatest possible value.

The workshop should provide the participants with a good up-to-date 
perspective on the tools that are now available for modeling, and 
solving logistics-oriented problems, on a large scale, and with an 
emphasis on the business process and information technology perspectives.

It should be noted that our aim, in the long term, is for this workshop 
to serve as a bridge between the business process research community and 
the logistics research community. Our vision is that the business 
process models, which are used on a daily basis for making the decisions 
needed for operating and reconfiguring the logistics systems, can 
naturally serve as the starting point for the problem formulations 
needed to optimize these logistics systems.

In the short term, however, we shall accept papers from the logistics 
community that expose and solve operations and reconfigurations types of 
problems, not necessarily based on business models. This can serve to 
familiarize the business process community with logistics systems.

Suggested Topics

Possible topics for the workshop are (but not restricted to):
* Modeling of processes in logistics-based systems
* Collaborative logistics problems
* Negotiation procedures and formalisms, within the context of logistics 
systems (supplier and customer selection procedures, etc.)
* Verification of processes in logistics-based systems
* Management of processes in logistics-based systems
* Matching supply and demand in global environments
* Value chain management
* Integrated processes and logistics

Submission Guidelines
Papers should be submitted in the English Language, in the PDF format 
and in conformance with the LNBIP (Lecture Notes in Business Information 
Processing) format.

Instructions for authors are available at: 
http://www.springer.com/series/7911.


Two types of papers can be submitted:
* Regular papers, with a size, from 9 to 12 pages, describing mature and 
complete work.
* Short papers, with a size from 6 to 9 pages, describing a work in 
progress that is soon to reach a mature stage.

Papers have to present original research contributions must not have 
been submitted elsewhere. All papers will be evaluated through a 
rigorous peer-review process, based on originality, scope (relevance to 
the workshop), and technical quality.

Papers must be submitted to the Web site:: 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pals2011. The review process 
will be a double-blinded peer-review. Therefore, please submit your 
papers without any author information.

Proceedings and Special Journal Issue
All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of ¡§BMP 2011 
Workshops¡¨, published by Springer (Lecture Notes). As this volume will 
appear after the conference, there will be informal proceedings 
distributed at the conference. Authors of papers accepted at the 
workshop must register at the conference.

Selected papers will be considered for extension and publication in a 
special issue of an international journal.

Important Dates
- Paper submission deadline: May, 30th, 2011
- Notification of acceptance: June 30th, 2011
- Camera ready: July 15th, 2011
- Workshop day: August 29th, 2011

Workshop Format
In addition to the presentation of accepted papers, there will be a 
tutorial on logistics systems.
