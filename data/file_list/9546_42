BPM 2011 is the ninth conference in a series that provides the most=20=20
distinguished research forum for researchers and practitioners in all=20=20
aspects of BPM including theory, frameworks, methods, techniques,=20=20
architectures, systems, and empirical findings. With an acceptance=20=20
rate in previous editions at around 13% the conference has a record of=20=20
attracting innovative research of highest quality, from a mix of=20=20
disciplines including Computer Science, Management Information=20=20
Science, Services Computing, Services Science, and Technology=20=20
Management.

This year=92s conference will continue with the broad-based themes of=20=20
previous editions, and strives to strengthen and expand in several key=20=20
directions . The conference encourages emerging research on new=20=20
conceptual models for BPM that attempt to unify core aspects of BPM,=20=20
including process management, data management, business rules and=20=20
requirements, and analytics. The conference also encourages the=20=20
increasing interest in applying established and new techniques, such=20=20
as model-driven architectures, Web services and Web architectures,=20=20
SOA, and Cloud Computing, to the specific challenges of BPM. In this=20=20
context, the conference is also looking for contributions on=20=20
implementation techniques and details for process or Web service=20=20
execution engines with focus on new application areas. Finally, the=20=20
conference seeks to attract papers that highlight the pervasive need=20=20
for BPM capabilities across application areas outside of business=20=20
management, including healthcare delivery, digital government,=20=20
disaster management, and management of scientific and other academic=20=20
endeavors, and that highlight how new techniques can solve the=20=20
distinctive challenges arising in those diverse areas. Awards will be=20=20
given to the best papers in different categories.

BPM 2011 will be held in Clermont-Ferrand, France, and will be=20=20
organized by the LIMOS Laboratory (http://www.isima.fr/limos/), CNRS,=20=20
Universit=E9 Blaise Pascal. The conference will take place at the campus=20=
=20
des cezeaux which is located about minutes from the city center.=20=20
Clermont-Ferrand is a medium-sized city located in the heart of=20=20
Auvergne, one of the most beautiful regions of France: ancient=20=20
volcanoes, lakes and gorges, historic sites and Romanesque=20=20
architecture make its wealth. Information about the venue and local=20=20

BPM 2011 invites research submissions on all topics related to=20=20
business process management, including but not limited to those listed=20=20
above. Research papers should be submitted electronically via the=20=20
EasyChair system at 13 March 2011.
Initial submissions must be received no later than 6 March 2011=20=20
(including at least title and abstract). Final papers must be=20=20
submitted by 13 March 2011. Submission details and formatting=20=20
instructions are given at the website. All accepted papers will be=20=20
included in the conference proceedings published by Springer-Verlag in=20=20
their LNCS series. For each accepted paper, at least one author is=20=20
required to register for the conference and should plan to present the=20=20
paper. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an=20=20
extended version of their paper to a special issue Information Systems=20=20
(an Elsevier Science Journal).
Additional Conference Activities
The BPM 2011 conference will include a diverse set of tracks and=20=20
activities in addition to the main research track. As with previous=20=20
editions of the conference, there will be several associated workshops=20=20
that explore newly emerging approaches, methods, and technologies in=20=20
the BPM space. All or most of these workshops will be held on 29=20=20
August 2011. The Demo Track will showcase new, innovative systems that=20=20
illustrate key BPM functionalities. The proceedings of the workshops,=20=20
and short papers describing the demos, will be published in a volume=20=20
of Springer=92s Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing=20=20
(LNBIP). The Industrial Experiences track aims at bridging the=20=20
viewpoints of leading research outcomes with practical demands and=20=20
industrial experience; practitioners are encouraged to submit papers=20=20
reporting on innovative industrial implementations and applications of=20=20
BPM methods and techniques, with a particular emphasis on their impact=20=20
on information technology use or business practice. The conference=20=20
will include tutorials on cutting-edge frameworks and associated=20=20
principled techniques for solving BPM challenges. There are plans for=20=20
a Doctoral Consortium, that will provide students in advanced stages=20=20
of their dissertation work an opportunity to share their research with=20=20
peers, world-class researchers, and industry experts in Business=20=20
Process Management. Finally, a summer school directly following the=20=20
main conference is envisioned.
