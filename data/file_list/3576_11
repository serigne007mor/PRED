Overview
----------------
The Eleventh International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held from 21 to 24 November 2022 in Cairo, Egypt. Its main 
objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research 
accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between 
the models and data research communities. MEDI’2022 provides an 
international platform for the presentation of research on models and 
data theory, the development of advanced technologies related to models 
and data, and their advanced applications. This international scientific 
event, initiated by researchers from Middle eastern countries, aims also 
at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects, 
and faculty/student exchanges.

-------------------------------
Topics of interest
------------------------------
Specific areas of interest to MEDI 2022 include but are not limited to:

Modelling and Models Engineering
- Modelling languages and related standards
- Modelling in software and complex system engineering
- Formal methods, analysis, verification & validation
- Model-based testing and performance analyses
- Ontology-based modelling
- Heterogeneous modelling, model integration, interoperability, model 
transformation
- Collaborative modelling and model repositories
- Models as services and models monitoring
- Modelling for reuse, dependability, and maintainability
- Models for security, trust, risk
- Models for Big Data & NoSQL databases

Data Engineering
- New models and architectures for databases
- Heterogeneous data, data Integration, Interoperability
- Data warehouses, OLAP, data mining, and Analytics
- Extending Data Warehousing Technology
- Database system Internals, performance analysis, self-tuning 
benchmarking, and testing
- Database security, personalization, recommendation
- Web databases, ontology-based databases
- Service-based data management
- Service-oriented applications
- Urbanization of database applications
- Data models for IA techniques and Machine Learning

Applications and tools
- Industry transfer, experiences
- Applications of modelling for Data Management
- Modelling tools and experimentation
- Lessons learned and reports related to models/data engineering

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission Guidelines and Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application 
papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Duplicate 
submissions are not allowed. Papers must be submitted as a single PDF 
document, via the Easychair system.
Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS style (Latex style only for 
camera-ready papers) and should not exceed 14 pages. Submitted papers 
will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, 
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.
The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper 
if it reports interesting results but does not justify a publication as 
a full paper.
As for the previous edition of MEDI, all accepted papers including short 
papers will be published in the Springer LNCS series.
One author of an accepted paper must register to MEDI 2022 in order to 
have the paper published.
Each accepted paper must be presented at the conference by one of the 
authors.

--------------------------------------------------------
Publication and Special Issues
---------------------------------------------------------
All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
Best papers will be invited for submission in special issues of 
well-ranked Journals:
To Be Announced *** under negotiation ***
