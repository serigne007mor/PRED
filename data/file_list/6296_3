INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR 
MULTIMEDIA UNDERSTANDING 
1-2 November 2014, Paris, France 
Conference site: iwcim.isep.fr 

Multimedia understanding is an important part of many intelligent applications in our social life, be it in our households, or in commercial, industrial, service, and scientific environments. 
Analyzing raw data to provide them with semantics is essential to exploit their full potential and help us managing our everyday tasks. Our purpose is to provide an international forum to 
present and discuss current trends and future directions in computational intelligence for multimedia understanding. The workshop, organized by the ERCIM MUSCLE Working Group, 
also aims at fostering the creation of a permanent network of scientists and practitioners for an easy and immediate access to people, data and ideas. 
Scope and Topics 

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: 

* Multimedia labeling, semantic annotation 
* Multimodal and cross-modal data analysis, clustering 
* Big data, distributed digital libraries 
* Activity and object detection and recognition 
* Text and speech recognition 
* Multimodal indexing and searching in very large data-bases 
* Visual data processing techniques 
* Medical image segmentation and model-based representation 
* Microscopic image feature extraction and classification 

Special Session Proposals 

Special sessions are organized during the IWCIM Workshop. Brief proposals should be submitted by 1st of July 2014 and must include topic title, rationale, session outline, 
contact information and the list of invited papers. Special session submissions should be sent to iwcim2014@isep.fr . Please refer to the IWCIM 2014 website for additional information.
