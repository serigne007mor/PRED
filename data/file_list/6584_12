Subject: [liste-egc] 1st CFPs ICCS 2014 : International Conference on
 Conceptual Structures 2014

 1st CFPs ICCS 2014 : International Conference on Conceptual Structures 
 2014

 Where: Iaşi, România
 When: Jul 27, 2014 - Jul 30, 2014
 Submission Deadline: Mar 9, 2014


 Scope and Significance

 The International Conferences on Conceptual Structures (ICCS) focus on 
 the formal analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge with 
 applications to artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and 
 related areas of computer science. The ICCS conferences evolved from a 
 series of seven annual workshops on conceptual graphs, starting with an 
 informal gathering hosted by John F. Sowa in 1986. Recently, graph-based 
 knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are getting more 
 and more attention. The aim of the ICCS 2014 conference is to build upon 
 its long standing expertise in graph-based KRR and focus on providing 
 modelling, formal and application results of graph-based systems.

 ICCS 2014 will be held in Iasi, Romania at the Al. I. Cuza University, 
 the oldest higher education institution in Romania. The university was 
 founded one year after the establishment of the Romanian state in 1860. 
 Iasi has a long tradition in higher education and has traditionally been 
 one of the leading centres of Romanian social, cultural, academic and 
 artistic life.

 The conference welcomes contributions that address graph-based 
 representation and reasoning paradigms (e.g. Bayesian Networks (BNs), 
 Semantic Networks (SNs), RDF(S), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept 
 Analysis (FCA), CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, Argumentation, Graph Databases, etc.) 
 from a modelling, theoretical and application viewpoint:

 - Modelling results will investigate concrete real world needs for 
 graph-based representation, how certain use cases are of interest to the 
 graph community, how using graphs can bring added (business) value, what 
 kind of graph representation is needed for a given case etc.

 - Technical results will include fundamental graph theory based results 
 for novel structures for representation, extensions of existing 
 structures for added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms 
 for reasoning, reasoning explanation, etc.

 - Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to 
 demonstrate the benefits of the graph-based proposed solutions in the 
 context of the use case studied with respect to other possible 
 solutions.

 The conference also welcomes papers on the following topics: Knowledge 
 Management, Knowledge Architectures, Reasoning under Inconsistency, 
 Knowledge Representation and Uncertainty, Contextual Logic, Metaphoric, 
 Cultural or Semiotic Considerations, Ontologies, Semantic Web, Web of 
 Data, Web 2.0, Conceptual Knowledge Acquisition, Data Mining, Text 
 Mining, Natural Language Processing, Linguistics, Constraint 
 Satisfaction, Decision Making, Resource Allocation and Agreement 
 Technologies.

 Submission and Publication

 We invite scientific publications of up to fourteen pages. For each 
 paper, an abstract must be submitted by March 2nd, 2014. Papers must be 
 formatted according to Springer’s LNCS style guidelines 
 (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0) and not 
 exceed the page limit. The submission is to be done via EasyChair 
 https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs20141. All submissions 
 will be refereed, and the conference proceedings will be published by 
 Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series - both online and printed. At least one 
 author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and 
 present the paper there.
