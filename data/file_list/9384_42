*Terminology and Artificial Intelligence 2015 *

*4 November - 6 November 2015*

*University of Granada, Spain*

​http://lexicon.ugr.es/tia2015/Home.html​

/Terminology and Artificial Intelligence/ (TIA) /2015/ will highlight 
the close connection between multilingual terminology, ontologies, and 
the representation of specialized knowledge. Knowledge, as regarded in 
Terminology, is something more complex than a simple hierarchy or a 
thesaurus-like structure. In this sense, ontologies, understood as a 
shared conceptualization of a domain that can be communicated between 
people and/or systems, are better suited for accounting for 
multilinguality and contextual constraints. The link between Terminology 
and knowledge representation has been widely acknowledged with the 
advent of multilingual ontologies.

This is particularly relevant since today’s networked society has 
generated an increasing number of contexts where multilingualism 
challenges current knowledge representation methods and techniques. To 
meet these challenges, it is necessary to deal with semantics since 
information can be organized, presented, and searched, based on meaning 
and not just text. Ideally, this would mean that language-independent 
specialized knowledge could be accessed across different natural 
languages. There is thus the urgent need for high-quality multilingual 
knowledge resources that are able to bridge communication barriers, and 
which can be linked and shared.

Such issues can only be successfully addressed with creative 
collaborative solutions within disciplines, such as knowledge 
engineering, terminology, ontology engineering, cognitive sciences, 
corpus lexicology, and computational linguistics. Accordingly, the TIA 
2015 Conference will provide a forum for interdisciplinary research that 
focuses on the intersection of different disciplines dealing with 
terminology, multilingualism, lexicology, ontology, and knowledge 
representation. Papers may address both theoretical questions and 
methodological aspects on these issues, as well as interdisciplinary 
approaches developed to facilitate convergence and co-operation in 
terminological aspects of importance to an increasingly multilingual 
society.

TIA 2015 solicits both regular papers (8 pages), which present 
significant work, and short papers (4 pages), which typically present 
work in progress or a smaller, focused contribution. Regardless of the 
language of the paper( English, Spanish, or French), all paper 
presentations will be in English. The submission deadline is June 15. 
See the conference webpage for more specific submission details.
