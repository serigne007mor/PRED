--- FOCUS ---

The traditional focus of the IDA symposium series is on end-to-end 
intelligent
support for data analysis. In 2010, the series re-focused to support papers
that go beyond established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-
changing" ideas, whilst not always being as fully realized as papers 
submitted
to other conferences.

IDA 2014 continues this approach and explicitly seeks "first look" 
papers that
might elsewhere be considered preliminary but contain potentially high 
impact
research. The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to ERA, is open 
to all
kinds of modeling and analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is
expected to be an interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that 
cut
across domains.


--- CALL FOR PHD POSTERS&  VIDEOS ---

The IDA symposium particularly welcomes contributions by graduate 
students. In
order to support this objective, the symposium will have a dedicated 
Poster and
Video Track for PhD student research, and it offers reduced registration 
rates
to all students.

If you are a PhD student and would like to present a poster about your 
research
at the symposium, please submit a one-page abstract (in PDF format) by 
e-mail to

ida2014.posters@gmail.com

Each abstract should include a title, and names and affiliations of all 
authors.
Poster presenters who would like to demonstrate software on a laptop are
encouraged to do so, but we ask you to explicitly mention this upon 
submission.
Within the extent possible, we will then strive to make available a 
table next
to your poster, which you can use for your laptop.

There will be two submission rounds, the early deadline leaving enough 
time to
apply for funding:


The late poster deadline is  September 10.
All submissions submitted will be judged
on first-come first-serve basis; authors will usually be notified
within a few days. However, no more new posters can be accepted
once the maximum number of posters has been reached.


--- POSTER VIDEOS AND VIDEO PRIZE ---

To attract additional attention to your poster and research, all authors of
accepted PhD abstracts will be invited to submit a video of maximum two 
minutes
length. Videos will be displayed during the breaks, and the best video
presentation will be awarded a Video Prize of 300 EUR. The prize winner 
will be
elected by the symposium attendees, and this year's prize will be 
sponsored by
SAS. Posters and videos must be presented in order to be eligible to the 
prize.
Details about video submission will be made available later.
