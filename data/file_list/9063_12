Subject: [liste-egc] CFP Special Issue of the I3 Journal on Complex Object
 Matching and Discovery - extended deadline

Call for Papers - Special Issue of the "Information-Interaction-Intelligence (I3)" Journal
==========================================================================================

Special Issue on "Complex Object Matching and Discovery"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Important dates
===============
Submission deadline: April 30, 2011 (Extended)
Notification: May 31, 2011



Focus of the Special Issue
==========================
Applications such as digital libraries, mediation systems and web services-based architectures produce masses of data generating a large number of models to be stored with the goal of being accessible to users (customers) expressing a specific need, that will be traduced partially or completely into a query. These models describe complex objects such as documents, business processes, services and ontologies for different knowledge domains; they are therefore heterogeneous and rich in terms of semantics. Giving the richness of these models and the huge number of stored objects, new techniques and tools are required to help user to retrieve the object satisfying his needs and preferences. The purpose of this special issue is to highlight and explore some of the more recent theoretical and practical advances in complex object matching and discovery.

Topics of interest for this special issue include, but are not limited to:

* graph matching and indexing,
* service matching and discovery (interface, protocols, QoS factors),
* business process models matching (for version management, delta-analysis,
* inter-organizational processes, etc),
* user profile matching for personalization,
* document matching and retrieval (XML, ..),
* schema matching,
* model management,
* ontology matching,
* resource discovery and matching for semantic web,
* query languages for complex object discovery,
* complex object mining,
* techniques and algorithms for information filtering and indexing,
* application areas : social networks, personalization, SOA, BPM,
* bioinformatics, XML, data and service integration.


Submission Details
==================
Manuscripts should be written in English and prepared for publication in accordance with the following instructions: http://www.revue-i3.org/Documents/soumission_en.php. The length of the paper is limited to 30 pages. Submissions should be sent in pdf format to daniela.grigori@prism.uvsq.fr and  ludovic.lietard@univ-rennes1.fr.

Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, presentation as well as relevance and contribution to the field of Complex Object Matching and Discovery. All papers will be rigorously refereed by 3 peer reviewers. Submission of a manuscript to this special issue implies that no similar paper is already accepted or will be submitted to any other conference or journal.
