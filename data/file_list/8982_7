IEEE WETICE'2011
Track: Collaborative Technology for Coordinating Crisis Management
June 27-29 2011, Paris

Web page: http://www.doesnotunderstand.org/wikka.php?wakka=3DCT2CM2011

This track will take place in June 2011 in Paris (France) during the
20th IEEE International Conference Collaboration Technologies and
Infrastructures (WETICE 2011):
http://events.telecom-sudparis.eu/wetice/

Selected papers will be invited to a Special Issue of the *International=20
Journal of Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management*=20
(IJISCRAM) after the conference.

Description
*************
In crisis situations (natural or industrial disasters, riots, ...),
the different actors managing crisis resolution have to act
simultaneously in emergency situations to reduce its impacts on the
real world. To achieve this common goal as quickly and efficiently as
possible, these actors (police, military forces, medical
organizations, NGOs but also emerging groups) have to collaborate and
act in a coordinated way. In the term coordination, we include all
the work needed for the actors, for the connected integration of their
information systems and also for the flexible synchronization of their
efforts, in order to handle the crisis in the most efficient way.
Coordination raises several problems such as the definition of the
universe of discourse, without which it would be impossible to solve
the various semantic conflicts that are bound to occur between several
autonomous and heterogeneous actors and their ISs. It involves the
finding of partners, emergent partners integration, their collective
decisions, partners plans negotiation and the synchronization of the
distributed and concurrent execution of their actions and plans.
Moreover, in a highly dynamic, open, unstable and uncertain
environment, such as the one met in crisis context, coordination
should be redesigned to be more reactive, pro-active, adaptive, robust
and visible for all the partners while preserving the essential part
of their autonomy. It is intended that this track should focus mainly
on the benefits of adopting collaborative enabling information
technologies such as: Agent based-systems, Collaborative BPMS,
Semantic Web or Group Decision Support Systems (DSS).

This track will try to address the following issues: how can
collaborative information technologies help with the coordination of
Crisis Management ? It is meant to cover the foundations, techniques,
methodologies and applications of Collaborative Information
Technologies for Coordinating Crisis Management. The track is
interdisciplinary in nature and open to contributions from fields as
varied as Cooperative Information Systems, Multi- Agent Systems,
Business Process Management and the Semantic Web.

Track topics
**************
Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Cooperative Information Gathering and Situation Awareness,
- Social Networks (media, citizens, ...) observations,
- Crisis Ontology,
- Adaptive and self-organization of the crisis management teams,
- Information System Interoperability and Inter-organizational issues,
- Group decision support,
- Crisis process design, enactment and adaptation,
- Agent models for : negotiation, trust, resource allocation, planning
and acting collaboratively,
- Crisis Management Systems.

Submissions guidelines
***************************
All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical
quality, relevance, significance, and clarity. At least three reviews
for each paper will be conducted. We are looking for submission of
full research papers and reports on field studies (up to 8 pages). All
track papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through
the Easychair website
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dct2cm2011 and should use
the IEEE US letter format. Every submitted paper will be evaluated by
at least three members of the program committee. Accepted papers will
be published along with the WETICE 2011 proceedings by the IEEE
Computer Society Press. Note that at least one author from each
accepted paper should register to attend WETICE 2011 for the paper to
be published in the proceedings.
