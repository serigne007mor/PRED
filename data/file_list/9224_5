Extension of submission deadline

*5th International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI???2015)
September 26-28, 2015, Rhodes Island, Greece

**http://delab.csd.auth.gr/medi2015/*


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges. Authors are invited to submit original unpublished work that is not currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

Invited Speaker
*Christian Jensen, Aalborg University, Denmark
Oscar Pastor Lopez, Polytechnical University of Valencia, Spain*

General Chairs
Yamine Ait Ameur, ENSEEIHT/IRIT, France
Athena Vakali, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece

Program Committee Chairs
Yannis Manolopoulos, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece
Ladjel Bellatreche, University of Poitiers, France

Proceedings
Springer Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer Science

*Special issues
International Journal of Intelligent Information and Database Systems
International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer, Springer*
