The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital
EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse
community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested
in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to the
resource management of Digital Ecosystems.
The conference seeks to address how current approaches and
technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end and
will include an informative and interactive session for the
presentation of demonstrations and industrial papers describing
original industrial applications, experiences and challenges.

Proposals should be focused on the conference topics and related techniques.

Proposals must be no more than four pages long. This page limit
includes all parts of the paper: title, abstract, body, and
bibliography.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 peer reviewers.
Selection criteria will include relevance, significance, impact,
technical soundness, and quality of presentation.
At least one author should attend the conference to present the proposal.
Accepted proposals will appear in the final proceedings of the main
conference published by ACM and indexed by the ACM Digital Library.

Demonstration proposals must clearly describe what will be

being demonstrated.

Optionally, proposals can include a URL that shows a preliminary
version of the demonstration such as screenshots
or another interactive program.
