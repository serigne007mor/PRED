CALL FOR PAPERS

The Fourteenth International Symposium on
Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2015)

October 22 - October 24, 2015, Saint-Etienne, France

Paper submission deadline: 8 May 2015

www.ida2015.org

--- FOCUS ---

The traditional focus of the IDA symposium series is on end-to-end 
intelligent
support for data analysis. In 2010, the series re-focused to support papers
that go beyond established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-
changing" ideas.

The symposium aims to provide a forum for inspiring research contributions
that might be considered preliminary in other leading conferences and 
journals,
but that have a potentially dramatic impact. To facilitate this, IDA 
2015 will
feature two tracks: a regular "Proceedings" track, as well as a 
"Horizon" track
for early-stage research of potentially ground-breaking nature. 
Submissions to
this latter track will not be published in the proceedings, to allow 
authors
to present their most adventurous and controversial research ideas without
running the risk of compromising any subsequent publications.

The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to ERA, is open to all 
kinds of
modeling and analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is 
expected to
be an interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that cut across
domains.

--- FRONTIER PRIZE ---

The IDA Frontier Prize will be awarded to the most visionary contribution.
Submissions considered for this award must present novel and surprising
approaches to data analysis. Last years' winners can be found on the IDA 
2015
website. The award consists of a plaque and a prize of 1000 euros.

Both Proceedings and Horizon track submissions are eligible for the 
Frontier
prize.

--- KEYNOTE SPEAKERS ---

Along with the contributed presentations, the symposium schedule will 
feature
three exciting keynote talks by renowned researchers, the details of 
which will
be announced in due course on our website:
http://www.ida2015.org/invited-speakers/

--- CALL FOR PAPERS ---

IDA solicits papers on all aspects of intelligent data analysis, including
papers on intelligent techniques to modeling and analyzing data from 
complex,
dynamical systems. IDA 2015 particularly encourages innovative papers 
about:

- Applications of IDA techniques to complex systems.
- Concepts and principles for the analysis of complex, inter-linked, and 
heterogeneous data.
- Human-computer interaction and cooperation for data analysis.
- The interplay between data analysis and visualization.
- Robustness and scalability issues of intelligent data analysis 
techniques.

The conventional reviewing process has a tendency to favor low risk 
incremental
contributions over inspiring high risk contributions. This can 
discourage the kind
of papers that IDA hopes to publish. For this reason, similar to IDA 
2014, IDA 2015
will have two paper tracks, the combination of which addresses this issue.

A] Proceedings Track

Papers submitted to this track will be reviewed and, if accepted, 
published in the
proceedings. Submitted papers should consist of at most 11 pages in LNCS 
format.
Papers may be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.

To ensure that the papers sought by IDA get accepted, referees will 
evaluate
papers against the stated goals of the symposium, and if at least one 
program
chair advisor writes an informed, thoughtful, positive review for a 
paper, this
may outweigh non-substantial or subjective criticisms of other reviewers.

We strongly encourage all authors to upload their Proceedings track 
submission onto
a preprint server such as arxiv, prior to submission. After acceptance 
uploading
your paper onto a preprint server will no longer be optional but 
mandatory, and we
will require all authors to do this by the camera-ready deadline.

Following IDA's tradition, the proceedings of IDA 2015 will be published 
as a
volume in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

B] Horizon Track

The Horizon track, which is a fine-tuned version of last year's First 
Look track,
aims to provide a forum for potentially ground-breaking research that is 
however
not yet mature enough for archival dissemination. You may have a great 
idea that
needs to be investigated in more detail, or you may have a long-term 
vision that
you would like to share. In these cases, it may be impossible or 
undesirable to
publish a preliminary version of your paper in the proceedings, but 
presenting
and discussing it at IDA may be of interest to both you and the community.

To be considered for a Horizon Track presentation, you are required to 
submit a
title and a short abstract (<250 words) and optionally any other 
material (e.g.
an extended abstract, a partial manuscript, a presentation, a movie, a 
website…)
that may help us to review the submission against the stated criteria. 
Titles and
abstracts of contributions accepted for the Horizon track will be listed 
on the
website and included in the proceedings front matter, but any other 
material submitted
will be used for reviewing only, and will not be publicly divulged in 
any form.
Horizon Track contributions may be accepted for either oral or poster 
presentation.
