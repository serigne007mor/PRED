Call for Participation in the 2014 Retrieving Diverse Social Images Task su=

MediaEval 2014 Multimedia Benchmark
http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2014/


*About MediaEval*
MediaEval (http://www.multimediaeval.org) is a benchmarking initiative dedi=
cated to evaluating new algorithms for multimedia access and retrieval. It =
emphasizes the 'multi' in multimedia and focuses on human and social aspect=
s of multimedia tasks. MediaEval attracts participants who are interested i=
n multimodal approaches to multimedia involving, e.g., speech recognition, =
visual analysis, music and audio analysis, user-contributed information (ta=
gs, comments, tweets), viewer affective response, social networks, geo-coor=
dinates and non-linear video access.

The MediaEval 2014 season kicks off with the MediaEval 2014 Survey. The sur=
vey is used to collect your opinion about which tasks should be offered by =
the MediaEval multimedia benchmark in 2014:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/mediaeval2014

The survey will take you about 5 minutes if you fill in only the main quest=
ions. There are 13 main questions, which are multiple choice questions that=
 collect your opinion on each of the 13 tasks that have been proposed for M=
ediaEval 2014. However, we encourage you to answer the additional questions=
 on the tasks that most interest you =97 your answers contribute to decisio=
ns than are made about the design and implementation of the tasks.

The MediaEval 2014 task list will be finalized in mid February and sign up =
for participation will open at the beginning of March. Please be sure to fi=
ll your email address in on the first page of the survey if you would like =
to receive an email when sign up opens.

Our goal is to have the survey filled out by as many researchers as possibl=
e in the next three weeks =97 please pass the survey link along to colleagu=
es in the field of multimedia who might be interested.

Note that the deadline for results submissions this year will be early to m=
id-September and the workshop will be held in October in Barcelona.


*About 2014 Retrieving Diverse Social Images Task*
This task is a follow-up of last year=92s edition. The task addresses the p=
roblem of result diversification in the context of social photo retrieval. =
The task this year is build around the same use case scenario as in 2013 (w=
e use a tourist use case). The participating systems are expected, given a =
ranked list of location photos retrieved from Flickr using text and GPS que=
ries, to refine the results by providing a set of images that are in the sa=
me time relevant to the query and provide a diversified summary of it (init=
ial results are typically noisy and redundant). The refinement and diversif=
ication process will be based on the social metadata associated with the im=
ages and on the visual characteristics of the images.

In particular, this year's novelty will be in exploring the effect of user =
annotation credibility on relevance and diversity. Credibility is determine=
d as an automatic estimation of the quality (correctness) of a particular u=
ser's tags (a specifically designed dataset will be used to train this meas=
ure). Participants will be encouraged to exploit this provided credibility =
estimation in addition to classical retrieval techniques.

Moreover, another novelty for this year will consist of introducing a more =
adequate diversification scenario by considering the annotation of up to 30=
0 images per location - compared to 150 last year.

Target communities involve both machine and human media analysis such as im=
age retrieval (text, vision, multimedia communities), re-ranking, relevance=
 feedback, crowd-sourcing and automatic geo-tagging. To solve the challenge=
, participants are free to choose from any approaches, from human oriented,=
 machine-based to hybrid machine-human; as well as to take advantage of any=
 additional data sources, e.g., the Internet. To encourage participation of=
 groups from different research areas, additional resources such as general=
 purpose visual descriptors and textual models will be provided for the ent=
ire collection. Evaluation of performance is going to be carried out by com=
parison with human generated ground truth.
