The Second International Workshop on Mining Complex Data - MCD'06 -

In Conjunction with IEEE ICDM'06

Hong Kong, 18 - 22 December 2006

This workshop is supported by IASC
Call for papers
Data mining and knowledge discovery can today be considered as stable fields
with numerous efficient methods and studies that have been proposed to
extract knowledge from data. Nevertheless, the famous golden nugget is still
challenging. Actually, the context evolved since the first definition of the
KDD process and knowledge has now to be extracted from data getting more and
more complex. The structure of the data, for instance, doesn’t match the
attribute-value format when considering the web, texts or videos.

In the framework of Data Mining, many software solutions were developed for
the extraction of knowledge from tabular data (which are typically obtained
from relational databases). Methodological extensions were proposed to deal
with data initially obtained from other sources, like in the context of
natural language (text mining) and image (image mining). KDD has thus
evolved following a unimodal scheme instantiated according to the type of
the underlying data (tabular data, text, images, etc), which, in the end,
always leads to working on the classical double entry tabular format.

However, in a large number of application domains, this unimodal approach
appears to be too restrictive. Consider for instance a corpus of medical
files. Each file can contain tabular data such as results of biological
analyzes, textual data coming from clinical reports, image data such as
radiographies, echograms, or electrocardiograms. In a decision making
framework, treating each type of information separately has serious
drawbacks. It appears therefore more and more necessary to consider these
different data simultaneously, thereby encompassing all their complexity.
Many examples of complex data can thus be found in potential knowledge
extraction processes. These data can be:

  a.. Semi-structured or unstructured
  b.. Sensor data such as scientific or medical data
  c.. Representing the same information at different periods
  d.. Grouping different kinds of information (images, text, ontologies,
etc.)
Hence, a natural question arises: how could one combine information of
different nature and associate them with a same semantic unit, which is for
instance the patient? On a methodological level, one could also wonder how
to compare such complex units via similarity measures. The classical
approach consists in aggregating partial dissimilarities computed on
components of the same type. However, this approach tends to make superposed
layers of information. It considers that the whole entity is the sum of its
components. By analogy with the analysis of complex systems, it appears that
knowledge discovery in complex data can not simply consist of the
concatenation of the partial information obtained from each part of the
object. The aim would rather be to discover more « global » knowledge giving
a meaning to the components and associating them with the semantic unit.
This fundamental information cannot be extracted by the currently considered
approaches and the available tools.

The new data mining strategies shall take into account the specificities of
complex objects (units with which are associated the complex data). These
specificities are summarized hereafter:

  a.. Different kind. The data associated to an object are of different
types. Besides classical numerical, categorical or symbolic descriptors,
text, image or audio/video data are often available.
  b.. Diversity of the sources. The data come from different sources. As
shown in the context of medical files, the collected data can come from
surveys filled in by doctors, textual reports, measures acquired from
medical equipment, radiographies, echograms, etc.
  c.. Evolving and distributed. It often happens that the same object is
described according to the same characteristics at different times or
different places. For instance, a patient may often consult several doctors,
each one of them producing specific information. These different data are
associated with the same subject.
  d.. Linked to expert knowledge. Intelligent data mining should also take
into account external information, also called expert knowledge, which could
be taken into account by means of ontology. In the framework of oncology for
instance, the expert knowledge is organized under the form of decision trees
and is made available under the form of “best practice guides” called
Standard Option Recommendations (SOR).
  e.. Dimensionality of the data. The association of different data sources
at different moments multiplies the points of view and therefore the number
of potential descriptors. The resulting high dimensionality is the cause of
both algorithmic and methodological difficulties.
The difficulty of Knowledge Discovery in complex data lies in all these
specificities.

The aim of this workshop is to address issues related to the concept of
mining complex data. The whole knowledge discovery process being involved,
our goal will be to attract papers dealing with each step of this process.
Actually, managing complex data within the KDD process implies to work on
every step, starting from the pre-processing (e.g. structuring and
organizing) to the visualization and interpretation (e.g. sorting or
filtering) of the results, via the data mining methods themselves (e.g.
classification, clustering, frequent patterns extraction, etc.). Papers are
invited in all KDD fields that involve complex data, including, but not
limited to:

  a.. Pre-processing, structuring and organizing complex data
  b.. Handling missing or wrong values
  c.. Data fusion, result fusion
  d.. Methods and algorithms for mining complex data
  e.. Mining heterogeneous data
  f.. Knowledge integration into the KDD process
  g.. Post-processing, visualization and interpretation support
  h.. Applications and experience feedback
  i.. Information retrieval in complex data bases
  j.. Ontology and metadata
The workshop will consist in a series of communications (oral presentations
or poster). A reasonable time will be left for the discussion after each
presentation. All the articles will be reviewed by at least two references
with a double aim of improving quality and giving advice to the authors. A
dedicated place will be given to the young researchers with a session
(Position paper) grouping the works in progress in various teams. This can
be a good occasion for a PhD student or a young researcher to present
his/her starting project. This session will be particularly significant for
works on their beginning and for the establishment of research groups on
shared topics. Demonstrations of research results could be associated with
the poster presentations.

The submitted manuscript should closely reflect the final paper as it will
appear in the Proceedings.

Papers should not exceed 8 pages (pdf or MS-Word) in the IEEE 2-column
format (see the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines at
the Conference Publishing Service )

Submitted papers will be evaluated by at least two reviewers. Any submission
that exceeds length limits or deviates from formatting requirements may be
rejected without review.
