Subject: [liste-egc] 18-month postdoc position at ETIS Lab

18-month full-time Postdoc research position
in mining and analysis of sentiments
at the ETIS Lab UMR 8051, CY Cergy Paris University, in Paris, France

The ETIS Lab (UMR 8051) of the CY Cergy Paris University has an
immediate opening for a post-doctoral researcher. The position is funded
by the H2020 EU-funded research project ANIMA (www.anima-project.eu/)
and has secured funding for 18 months. The post-doctoral researcher will
work under the supervision of Professor Dimitris Kotzinos and in
collaboration with other researchers in his respective group.
This postdoctoral project will take an innovative multidisciplinary
approach by developing Data Science (Big Data, Machine Learning and/or
AI) based techniques to mine opinion models and do sentiment analysis
around quality of life around airport regions and classify their aspects.

CONTEXT
Traditionally, opinion of people about different aspects of their lives
were obtained through various types of surveys either made by person or
online or more recently with the use of mobile apps. These kinds of
surveys are though expensive and the researchers can reach only a
limited amount of people. On the other hand, the recent explosion on
social media content both in terms of volume and variety but also in
timeliness, made platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram an
excellent source of people’s opinions and sentiments towards various
subjects. But data collected from these platforms carry an inherent bias
(not everybody is using them) and this is sometimes amplified by the use
of bots and other automated posting agents.
In order to further focus our research, data from additional platforms,
where people post comments on their experiences (like TripAdvisor, Yelp
or AirBnB), will be also used to collect opinions on some of the aspects
of the quality of life. Additionally, data from external sources like
land use and land value data sets will be crossed with the opinions
collected in order to understand what is the actual impact of the
opinions in the economy of the area.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
Modelling and capturing opinions and their evolution in a
quality-of-life context is a new exciting area of interdisciplinary
research. The work will combine properties arising from the online
social networks with text analytical functions in order to form a model
of opinions and then track the evolution of this model through
subsequent interactions. We plan to do this through a series of learning
and mining tasks over dynamic data, understand the boundaries of the
existing algorithms for such tasks and propose new ones when needed.
Besides the evolution of the opinions, we are interested in identifying
the dynamics and correlations that affect the changes that will be
observed. We would like to push the boundaries of the opinion mining and
dynamics works while applying them to better understand the opinions and
the sentiments of people around the specific subjects of quality of life
and airport noise.

Key Responsibilities and Tasks:
•	Developing new measures and methods for gathering opinion related data
streams
•	Developing new opinion mining methods, opinion models as well as
algorithms to track their evolution
•	Develop or extend methods for sentiment analysis, classification and
aspect characterization with a focus on data related to quality of life
and noise
•	Co-authoring one or two project deliverables
•	First-authoring top-tier peer-reviewed journals and conference
proceedings
•	Presenting findings at national/international scientific conferences
•	Develop a toolkit that can be used for subsequent opinion mining studies

Qualifications and Skills/Experience:
•	Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning, or a related field. Applicants that will
defend their PhDs before or around the beginning of the post-doc
(04/2020) are also welcome to apply.
•	Strong analytical and programming skills. Experience in tools used for
big data analytics (in R, Python, Java or all) and in Cloud Computing
environments is a plus
•	Strong oral and written communication skills
•	Demonstrated experience preparing conference presentations, research
findings, and manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals
•	Language: the working language will be English

LOCATION
Cergy-Pontoise (suburb of Paris France).
The post-doctoral researcher will be located at the ETIS Lab (UMR 8051)
at the CY Cergy Paris University.

TENTATIVE STARTING DATE:
As soon as possible.

APPLICATION
If interested, please send your application (including a detailed CV,
university transcripts, a copy of the PhD thesis and/or scientific
papers if available, as well as a list of personal references and a
motivation letter) in PDF format to Professor Dimitris Kotzinos
(Dimitrios.Kotzinos@u-cergy.fr) with title “Postdoc ANIMA”. Further
informal inquiries are also welcome.
