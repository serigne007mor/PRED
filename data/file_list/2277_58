Bonjour,



*The 4th Special Session on High Performance Services Computing and 
Internet Technologies (SerCo 2020)**
**http://hpcs2020.cisedu.info/2-conference/special-sessions/session05-serco**
**
**As part of The 18th International Conference on High Performance 
Computing & Simulation (HPCS 2020)**
**http://hpcs2020.cisedu.info**
**
**26 - 30 October 2020**
**Barcelona, Spain*


*Best Papers of the Special Session will be Invited for Extended 
Submissions to Top-Quality Journals*


*SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES*

Since its establishment as a software design style, Service Oriented 
Architectures have taken the ICT world by storm. The Lego pieces logic 
thrived through Cloud Computing and it is now considered the standard 
approach in practically every application framework. The keyword for 
this success is adaptivity: Service Oriented Architectures are 
implemented through a wide range of technologies and tools leading to 
numerous combinations that meet the application requirements in the 
desired way.

But there is a specific combination of application characteristics and 
requirements that seemingly put SOAs to the test: data-intensive tasks 
coupled with performance and temporal requirements. The challenge is 
justified because SOAs are simply not meant to deal with shifting large 
data volumes between nodes. And unfortunately this is a common problem 
nowadays: IoT and big data applications are simply two general 
application categories that come with exactly those characteristics and 
-more often than not- with the said temporal requirements. To a certain 
extent the problem is mitigated through the increase of the SOA 
infrastructures’ computing and storage node density while “stretching” 
them at the same time. Edge and fog computing as well as lambda services 
are emerging trends that validate the concept.

This special session invites research communities from a diverse set of 
scientific areas such as cloud, distributed, parallel and 
high-performance computing to publish their work and share opinions 
about applications, challenges and viable solutions to the potential new 
systems emerging from the need to deal with data intensive application 
tasks within a SOA and services computing framework.

The SerCo Session topics include (but are not limited to) the following:
