Subject: [liste-egc] Postdoc position: Event prediction for dialogue
 modelling

Postdoc position available at GREYC - University of Caen Basse-Normandie=20
- France

Event prediction for dialogue modelling in embodied conversational agent

Location: Caen (France)
Duration: 18 months
Keywords: sequence mining, knowledge discovery, event prediction,=20
dialogue modelling

Description of the task:

Designing a model of dialogue is a difficult and often
multidisciplinary task. Whether it is dedicated to interactive
storytelling or not, it involves many algorithms: multi-modal input
recognition (utterances, gestures, gazes, vocal inflections), natural
language understanding and generation, dialogue management, planning
and cognitive capacities, emotion modelling, prosodic speech
generation, non-verbal behavior.

In this context, the post-doc fellow=92s research will focus on
designing algorithms for modelling the interactions (turn of speech)
during the conversation, starting from real data gathered during
dialogues between adult (or Wizard of Oz) and child, that are
annotated by psychologists. This task can be viewed as predicting a
particular event in a sequence of itemsets. The model of the dialogue
will be implemented in an embodied conversational agent.

Application:
