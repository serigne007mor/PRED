*Q4APS Call for Papers*

Workshop on =E2=80=9CQuestion Answering And Activity Analysis in Participat=
ory Sites=E2=80=9D collocated with the international World-Wide Web Confere=
nce 2016 in Montreal
https://project.inria.fr/q4aps2016/


User-generated content and social media are increasingly exploited to suppo=
rt content mining, recommendation, social structure analysis, etc. However,=
 for some kinds of online community sites such as question-and-answer sites=
 and forums there is no explicit social network structures but instead spec=
ific discussion structures (e.g. threads) and contribution types (e.g. ques=
tions, answers, edits) that are traces of the activity of often implicit co=
mmunities of interest. Community Question Answering sites (CQA) and questio=
n-answering services (Q&A) are now an important part of the information sou=
rces searched and accessed by users today to solve problems and take decisi=
ons. A famous example is the StackOverFlow website. Question-answer sites a=
nd services serve millions of users and generate an important and popular p=
art of the Web content. In this context, being able to efficiently analyze,=
 structure, search, automate and reuse question-answering data is an import=
ant challenge.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners of Qu=
estion Answering sites and services on the Web to present and discuss lates=
t advances in analyzing, supporting and automating tasks of the life-cycle =
of such applications. The goal is to cover and bring together the different=
 approaches existing in managing and answering natural language questions o=
f users on the Web. This includes methods, models and algorithms from autom=
ated question-answering to question-answering forums mining, monitoring and=
 management automation. In this context, the workshop welcomes submissions =
of original, high-quality papers focused on question-answering site and ser=
vices.

Topics covered by the workshop include the following:
- question routing, question answering
- question and answer recommendation
- question and need analysis, question modeling
- expert finding, expertise categorization, expertise labeling
- debate analysis, argument mining, argument schemes
- moderating support and automation
- animation fostering, targeted solicitation and notification
- answer generation, multiple and/or heterogeneous answer sources
- answer detection and ranking, best answer identification
- answer building and answer improving
- questions and expert topic labeling
- role detection (questioner, answerer, editor, etc.), user modeling
- social aspects of question answering
- fact checking, cross-validation, supporting evidence
- spam or abuse prevention in questions and answers
- answer personalization
- challenges, datasets, benchmarks for question-answering evaluation

Paper Submission:
The submission and reviews will follow a classical peer-review process usin=
g EasyChair. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members.
We solicit full research papers (6-8 pages), and short papers (3-4 pages) b=
oth in the ACM conference paper style. Papers should be submitted to the Q4=
APS2016 EasyChair account:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dq4aps2016

All submitted papers must be written in English, be formatted according to =
the ACM SIG Proceedings template and be in a PDF format that can be viewed =
on any platform.
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates=20

Submissions should be non-anonymous; they will be peer-reviewed by at least=
 three independent reviewers. Accepted papers will be presented at the work=
shop and included in the workshop proceedings.
Accepted workshop papers will be published in the WWW companion proceedings=
 and will be available from the ACM Digital Library. This may be regarded a=
s prior publications by other conferences or journals.
For inclusion in the proceedings, at least one author of the accepted paper=
 has to register for the conference and to attend the workshop.
Presenters are encouraged to bring demos to the workshop to enhance oral di=
scussions and presentations.

Schedule
- Due date for full workshop papers submission: January 11th 2015
- Notification of paper acceptance to authors: February 2nd 2016
- Camera-ready of accepted papers: February 8th 2016
- Workshop: April 11, 12 or 13, 2016
