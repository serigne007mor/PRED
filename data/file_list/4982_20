With the emergence of the Internet of Things and complex networked =
systems, safety and security in such complex application contexts is =
becoming critical. In particular, this relates to such industrial =
domains providing critical infrastructures, but also in the context of =
initiatives such as Industry 4.0. Here, network analysis provides for an =
emerging research field to be applied for safety and security analytics, =
e.g., for anomaly and threat detection and risk assessment.

This special session aims at providing a forum for the discussion of =
this emerging research field. The meeting targets both researchers and =
practitioners interested in applying network analysis methods for =
investigating safety and security aspects in the industrial domain. A =
non-exhaustive list of targeted topics includes:

- Complex/multiplex networks models for industrial settings
- Feature-rich networks in complex industrial domains
- Dynamic network analysis for risk estimation
- Link prediction for risk and security issues
- Multiplex and attributed networks evolution
- Community detection for risk estimation
- Hotspot detection
- Anomaly detection
- Multiplex network mining
- Applications of all of the above
