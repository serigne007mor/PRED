===================================================================
                            CALL FOR PAPERS

                              EvoCOP 2011

        The 11th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation
            and Metaheuristics in Combinatorial Optimization

                   27-29 April 2011 - Torino, Italy

               (New submission deadline: 30 November 2010)

                        http://www.evostar.org
===================================================================

Topics
------

Metaheuristics are used to solve difficult combinatorial optimization
problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific
domains. Prominent examples of metaheuristics include: evolutionary
algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, scatter search and path
relinking, memetic algorithms, ant colony and particle swarm
optimization, variable neighborhood search, iterated local search,
greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, estimation of
distribution algorithms, and hyperheuristics. Successfully solved
problems include scheduling, timetabling, network design,
transportation and distribution problems, vehicle routing, traveling
salesman, graph problems, satisfiability, packing problems, planning
problems, and general mixed integer
programming.

The EvoCOP series, started in 2001 and held annually since then, was
the first event specifically dedicated to the application of
evolutionary computation and related methods to combinatorial
optimization problems. Following the general trend of hybrid
metaheuristics and diminishing boundaries between the different
classes of metaheuristics, EvoCOP broadened its scope in 2006, and now
explicitly invites submissions on any kind of metaheuristic for
combinatorial optimization. All accepted papers will be presented
orally at the conference and printed in the proceedings published by
Springer in the LNCS series (see LNCS volumes 2037, 2279, 2611, 3004,
3448, 3906, 4446, 4972, 5482, 6022 for the previous proceedings).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems
- Novel application domains for metaheuristic optimisation methods
- Representation techniques
- Neighborhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them
- Variation operators for stochastic search methods
- Constraint-handling techniques
- Hybrid methods and hybridization techniques
- Parallelization
- Theoretical developments
- Search space analyses
- Comparisons between different (also exact) techniques
- Automated tuning of metaheuristics using machine learning,
evolutionary and other approaches

The conference will be held in conjunction with EuroGP2011 (the 14th European
Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoBIO 2011 (the 8th European
Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data
Mining in Bioinformatics), and EvoWorkshops 2011 (including specialist
workshops on a range of evolutionary computation topics and
applications), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar 2011.


Submission
----------

New submission deadline: 30 November, 2010

Submissions will be done electronically using the online submission service.
More details will be available at the conference website

http://www.evostar.org

Papers must be formatted following Springer LNCS guidelines, with no
more than 12 pages.

IMPORTANT: The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit
information about the authors in the submitted paper. The submissions
will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program
committee.
