About WIMS=E2=80=9914 Conference
--------------------------------------
WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science conference=
s. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to  present their state-=
of-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to  examine performance cha=
racteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent information tec=
hnology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of Web-based=
 intelligent information management solutions across different domains.

Objectives
--------------
The purpose of the WIMS series is:
- To provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to prese=
nt their contributions to the state of the art research and development in =
Web technology and applications
- To give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research  to a =
friendly and knowledgeable audience and receive valuable feedback
- To provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and =
practitioners can meet

Call for Research Papers/Posters
--------------------------------------------
WIMS=E2=80=9914 is intended to foster the dissemination of state-of-the-art=
 research in the area of Web intelligence, Web mining, Web semantics  and t=
he fundamental interaction between them. Authors are invited to  submit reg=
ular (12 pages) or short (6 pages) research papers or  posters (4 pages) on=
 all related areas. Papers exploring new  directions or areas will receive =
a thorough and encouraging review.

More details on the nature of the different submission types can be found a=
t:
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/?page_id=3D23

The papers in all the categories should describe original results that have=

ors, industry leaders, and practitioners to present and  exchange ideas, re=
sults, and experiences in the applications of Web Intelligence, Mining, and=
 Semantics (WIMS). The Application & Case Studies Track invites submissions=
 describing implementations of Web Intelligence, Mining, and Semantics in i=
ndustrial or government or other =E2=80=98real world=E2=80=99 settings. Pap=
ers must include descriptions of how the applications have been conceived, =
developed, and (probably)  deployed.
