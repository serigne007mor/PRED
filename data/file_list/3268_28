> WNAPC brings together academics, administrators and professors from Latin

,
> there is a need to

f
> the Computing area.
> The event aims at identifying specific content differences in
> undergraduate computing careers
> across several Latin American countries, as well as at strengthening
> existing de facto standards.
> The workshop organisers consider it very important that undergraduate
> programs be coherent in
> their content, the set of skills they foster, the degrees they award and
> the training of the
> faculty. The organisers believe that that coherence would increase the
> mobility of professionals
> within the region and also outwards, greatly increasing the level of

>CLEI XLVIII calls for papers reporting results of a theoretical nature and=
/or practice <br>that advance the state of the art or present relevant appl=
ications or cases in the areas <br>of interest of the symposia or associate=
d events. CLEI XLVIII will be held in Armenia, Colombia, <br>from October 1=
7 to 21, 2022, in a hybrid edition, allowing the participation of exhibitor=
s <br>and attendees both in person and virtually. This year the Journal Fir=
st format is incorporated, <br>seeking to expand communication within the s=
cientific community. <br><br>The Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI)=
 is an annual event organised by the Latin American <br>Center for Computat=
ional Studies (CLEI), and since 1974, it is a travelling event between <br>=
Latin American countries. CLEI is the main Latin American forum for exchang=
ing ideas, experiences <br>and research results between researchers, profes=
sionals and students in informatics and computer <br>science and engineerin=
g, as well as its technological applications, through conferences, workshop=
s, <br>tutorials and panels. <br><br><b>Venue: Universidad del Quind=C3=ADo=

dentifying specific content differences in undergraduate computing careers =
<br>across several Latin American countries, as well as at strengthening ex=

ortant that undergraduate programs be coherent in <br>their content, the se=
t of skills they foster, the degrees they award and the training of the <br=
>faculty. The organisers believe that that coherence would increase the mob=
ility of professionals <br>within the region and also outwards, greatly inc=
reasing the level of understanding of who we form <br>in our programs. Indu=
stry&#39;s medium-term interest is also contemplated, as it will simplify <=
