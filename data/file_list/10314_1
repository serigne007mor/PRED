*********************************************************************************

CFP – -- ACM/IEEE ASONAM 2013

The 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social
Networks Analysis and Mining
Niagara Falls, Canada, August 25-28, 2013
http://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca

Do not miss the opportunity to participate in the premier conference in 
social network analysis and mining. You have one week to complete your 
submission to the main conference.

Full paper submission deadline: April 15, 2013 (Please note that the 
deadline is final and the submission site will be closed at 11:59pm PST 
on April 15, 2013)

ACM IEEE ASONAM 2013 is jointly sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and 
ACM SIGKDD
The proceedings will be published by the prestigious IEEE CS – CPS; and 
will be indexed in IEEE and ACM digital libraries.
Extended versions of the best papers will be invited for publication in 
the SNAM journal by Springer.

The study of social networks originated in social and business
communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced
significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social
Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the
online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging
systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine
learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social
medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences
and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution.
This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics,
homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known
entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which
actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.

The ACM/IEEE international conference on Advances in Social Network
Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2013) will primarily provide an
interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and
researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations
and exchange of ideas and practices. IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2013 is intended
to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging
trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis
and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works
on social network analysis and mining along with their application to
real life situations.

General areas of interest to IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2013 include information
science and mathematics, communication studies, business and
organizational studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied
linguistics, biology and medicine.

More specialized topics within ASONAM include, but are not limited to:

* Adoption of new services on social network platforms
* Agent based social simulation, agent based computational models
* Anomaly detection in social network evolution

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining to 
the above topics are solicited (Proceeding indexed by EI). Full paper 
submission deadline is April 15, 2013. These papers will follow an 
academic review process. Full paper manuscripts must be in English with 
a maximum length of 8 pages (using the IEEE two-column template).

Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s), e-mail 
address(es), tel/fax numbers, abstract, and postal address(es) on the 
first page. Papers should be submitted to the Conference Web site: 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=asonam2013,

attachment via email to ozyer@etu.edu.tr by April 15, 2013. The 
attachment must be in PDF or Word .doc format.

Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, 
significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Authors should 
certify that their papers represent substantially new previously 
unpublished work. Paper submission implies that the intent is for one of 
the authors to present the paper if accepted and that at least one of 
the authors will register for a full conference fee.
