CALL FOR PAPERS

IEEE Multimedia
Special Issue on Multimedia Data Management in Mobile Computing

Submission Deadline: 20 Dec 2012
Publication: Jan=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=93Mar 2014

Thanks to the widespread availability of network-enabled portable multimedi=
a devices, able to capture, share, and access vast amounts of multimedia co=
ntents, there is an ever-increasing interest in new technologies providing =
improved multimedia data management in mobile environments. Some ofthe open=
 challenges in this field include dealing with computational andstorage lim=
itations of mobile terminals, overcoming the strong limitation of batteries=
, achieving better bandwidth/latency in network access, enabling mobile acc=
ess to large multimedia repositories, and providing more effective user int=
eraction. Most of these problems can be attacked from different viewpoints,=
 for instance, increasing the capacity of devices versus reducing the consu=
mption of resources, increasing the efficiency of software tools versus str=
engthening hardware architectures, and maximizingthe network throughput ver=
sus representing more efficiently the information. Technological breakthrou=
ghs are fos!
   tered in all such fields, in a research context that is largely cross-di=
sciplinary.

Although most of the aforementioned technologies have been studied for year=
s within the broader multimedia community, mobility introduces some peculia=
r features that make the problem particularly challenging and, at thesame t=
ime, attractive for research. Fitting a rich multimedia applicationinto a s=
mall-screen device with limited interactivity, dealing with users with part=
ial attention/interaction (who might be walking or driving a car, for examp=
le), adapting the huge amount of data available on the Internet to the seve=
rely limited capabilities of a mobile device, managing thevariability in lo=
cation or proximity to places or other users, or seamlessly handling the un=
predictable variation of network coverage, are just some examples of the pr=
oblems to be solved to achieve effective mobile multimedia solutions.

This special issue focuses on the management and exploitation of multimedia=
 data in mobile computing environments. Progress in this area would be valu=
able in a number of different scenarios. A noncomprehensive list might incl=
ude event capturing and sharing, where users can exploit handhelds to spot =
any interesting situation and distribute it in real time; vehicular network=
s, where a car equipped with cameras might transmit multimedia data to othe=
r drivers or to a remote center, sharing traffic information or advertiseme=
nts; TV broadcasting/multicasting, where mobile cameras could be managed an=
d any mobile user with a smartphone could potentially become a source of mu=
ltimedia data for a newspaper or news agency if they are located in an area=
 where something interesting is happening; emergency management, where mult=
imedia data can be captured and transmitted by different types of devices t=
o help the emergency services to get ready to assist people in the best pos=
sible way; and!
    mobile social networks, where users can exchange multimedia information=
 among friends or people located in a certain area, possibly georeferenced =
or enriched with geospatial data related to maps and/or points of interest =
(POI).

The main goal of the special issue is to collect papers reporting the lates=
t advances in the technologies, algorithms, models, standards, and applicat=
ions for managing and exploiting multimedia data in mobile computing enviro=
nments. Although all relevant technologies are potentially of interest, spe=
cial attention will be given to papers providing specific insighton the joi=
nt mobile-multimedia research. The following list of topics further stresse=
s this by highlighting some of the expected fields of contribution =C3=A2=
=C2=80=C2=94 specifically, technologies for multimedia management in mobile=
 environments, use of semantic technologies in mobile multimedia, profiling=
 and personalization of mobile users, mobile multimedia and multimodal inte=
rfaces, and applications and scenarios for mobile multimedia technologies.

Topic

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Beyond current limitations of multimedia in mobile computing
- Semantic and context-aware management of multimedia in mobile environments
- Sharing multimedia contents in mobile environments
- Mobile multimedia search and retrieval
- Management of mobile generated multimedia contents
- Multimedia in vehicular networks
- Multimedia multimodal interaction for mobile users
- Multimedia in mobile social networks
- Multimedia and geo-location services
- Mobile user profiling and personalization
- Standards for multimedia data in mobile computing
- Innovative architectures, applications and services for mobile multimedia

All the papers submitted should be clearly related to multimedia mobile com=
puting and deal with issues considered from the perspective of data managem=
ent, rather than from a networking point of view.
