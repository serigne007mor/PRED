Analogical proportions, i.e., statements of the form "A is to B as C is to =
D", are the basis of analogical inference and they are closely related to c=
ase-based reasoning and transfer learning.
They are have been used on NLP tasks such as automatic machine translation,=
 semantic and morphological tasks, as well as visual question answering wit=
h competitive results.
Moreover, analogical reasoning can support several machine learning tasks s=
uch as classification, decision making, or dataset augmentation.
However, other less explored applications could be envisioned such as knowl=
edge discovery and management (e.g., knowledge graphs refinement, data set =
completion, and alignment), recommender systems, and other AI-related tasks=
 such as explainable AI.

The purpose of this workshop is thus to explore both foundational and appli=
cative aspects of analogical reasoning in various fields, e.g., machine lea=
rning, knowledge representation, discovery, and reasoning, as well as in in=
dustry practice with real-world data, applications, and associated challeng=
es, for instance, scalability issues.

Themes and topics

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We invite submissions of research papers on the foundational theory of anal=
ogies, on interactions between case-based reasoning and analogies, as well =
as on applicative use-case studies.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Foundational theory of analogies:
    - Axiomatic approaches to analogical proportions;
    - Analogy-preserving functions;
    - Interactions between case-based and analogical reasoning.

* Applications:
    - Analogical reasoning in machine learning;
    - Analogical reasoning in visual domains;
    - Analogical reasoning in Natural Language Processing;
    - Analogical reasoning in healthcare;
    - Analogy based explanations;
    - Analogies in software engineering;
    - Analogies in knowledge management.
