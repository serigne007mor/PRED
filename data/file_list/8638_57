=====================================================
                 Workshop AMLaGAP
  Analysing and Mining Large Graphs and Networks : Algorithms and 
Performance
                 19-20 May 2014 Orléans (France)

https://sites.google.com/site/amlagap/

Aims and scope:

Graphs and networks have been studied for a long time in many domains
of computer science since they are suitable to model irregular
problems. For example, they are widely used in computational science
to run simulations on river networks, bloodstream or vehicular traffic
but they also are used to model and analyse interactions between
people like in social networks. With the improvements of data
capturing, the increasing complexity of mathematical models and
the growth of social networks, all the domains where they are used
require to compute on increasingly large graphs and networks. The
object of AMLaGAP is to bring together researchers on various domains
using large graphs and networks to exchange ideas on the recent
advances to compute and mine such data structures but also on current
locks they encounter. AMLaGAP invites the submission of presentations
on all topics including (but not limited to) the following aspects of
large graph and networks:

- Parallel algorithms for large graphs
- Social network analysis
- Data mining in large graphs
- Exploration and visualization of large graphs
- Scientific simulation using large graphs
- Programming models and tools for large graphs

Invited speakers:
     Rob Bisseling (Utrecht University, Netherland)
     Jean-François Boulicaut (LIRIS, INSA Lyon, France)

Program committee:

Rob Bisseling (Utrecht University, Netherlands)
Zhenjiang Hu (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)
Sébastien Limet (University of Orléans, France)
Frédéric Loulergue (University of Orléans, France)
Antony Perez (University of Orléans, France)
Christel Vrain  (University of Orléans, France)


Presentation submission:

Submitted talks can be original, ongoing work or recently published
work. Submission should include a cover page with authors' names,
affiliation addresses, fax numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses
and an abstract that covers 4 pages.  Only PDF files will be accepted.
Proposals will be evaluated on their scientific quality and their
adequacy to the topics of workshop. Authors will be notify one week
after their submission.

Submission URL https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=amlagap2014

Authors of original work will be invited to submit a full paper for a
special issue of the electronic journal Scalable Computing: Practice
and Experience
