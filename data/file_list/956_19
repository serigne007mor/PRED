Call for workshop proposals

The 2011 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence
and Intelligent Agent Technology

22 – 27 August 2011, Lyon, France

http://wi-iat-2011.org

The Program Committees of the 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint
Conference on Web Intelligence and
Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT’11) invite proposals for Workshops.
The Workshops will be held within the Conference,
August, 22, 2011 at Lyon, France.

The main goal of the WI-IAT’11 workshops is to stimulate and facilitate
active exchange, interaction and comparison of approaches,
methods and ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and
applied, in the general areas related to Web Intelligence and
Intelligent Agent Technology. The workshops will provide an informal
setting where participants will have the opportunity to
discuss specific technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active
exchange of ideas.

The workshop organizers will be responsible for advertising the workshop,
forming the program committees, reviewing and selecting
the papers, and guaranteeing a high quality worthy of the prestige and
range of the Conference. All papers accepted for workshops
will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by IEEE Computer
Society Press and will be available at the workshops.

The workshop organizers will also have the discretion of editing selected
papers (after their expansion and revision) into books or
special journal issues. Workshops may be full-day or half-day. A full-day
workshop should select 10-14 regular papers, while a half-day
workshop should select 5-7 regular papers, from a large number of
submissions. Submissions accepted as workshop papers will be
allocated 4 pages in the proceedings. The workshop organizers should
ensure the presence of authors of accepted papers at the
workshops. Optionally, the workshop may be started or concluded by a panel
focusing on interesting aspects, controversial issues, or
unsolved problems to stimulate lively, thoughtful, and thought-provoking
debate; we expect the workshop organizers to actively
engage the audience and help them gain a deeper understanding of the
issues. The goal of a panel is to debate and thus panels
should always reflect more than one point of view.


Workshop Proposals Submission:

Workshop organizers should submit their proposals (PDF) directly to the
three Workshop Chairs
via e-mail (see their email addresses below).

Workshop proposals should include the following elements:

- Title of the workshop
- Names of workshop organizers, affiliation, mailing address and e-mail
address
- Short CV of organizers
- A description of the topics of the workshop (not exceeding 200 words)
- Type of the workshop (full-day or half-day)
- A description of how the workshop will contribute to the field of Web
Intelligence and/or Intelligent Agent Technology
- A short description on how the workshop will be advertised so as to
ensure a sufficiently wide range of authors and high quality papers
- Information about previous offerings of the proposed workshop.

Topics of Interest

Each workshop subject will focus on new research challenges and
initiatives in Web Intelligence (WI) and
Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT). The workshops should provide an
informal and vibrant forum for researchers
and industry practitioners to share their research results and practical
development experiences in
these two fields. Suggested, workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

- Intelligent e-Technology (including e-Science, e-Business, e-Things and
e-Activities, e-Learning, e-Finance, e-Medicine, e-Government,
e-Community)
- Intelligent Human-Web Interaction
