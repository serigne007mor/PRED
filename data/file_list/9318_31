IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2015
====================

*** The 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social
Network Analysis and Mining ***

Paris, France, August 25-28, 2015
http://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2015/

====================================

Dear Colleague,

The study of social networks originated in social and business communities.
In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the
development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and
Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites,
email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely
analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People
perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction
among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities,
community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of
SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and business. This follows
the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into
networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural
embedding.

The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and
Mining (ASONAM 2015) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that
will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM
fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices.
ASONAM 2015 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus
on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking
analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical
works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to
real life situations.

Papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a "Best
Paper Award" ceremony will be organized at the banquet.
