OVERVIEW

DAS 2022 is the 15th international IAPR-sponsored workshop dedicated toward=
s system-level approaches and related challenges in document analysis and r=
ecognition. This includes models, methods, and relevant applications satisf=
ying real-world engineering requirements. The workshop provides an exciting=
 platform for interactions and high-level technical exchanges between indus=
trial and academic communities. The DAS 2022 program will include invited t=
alks, oral and poster paper presentations, tutorials, demonstrations, and w=
orking group discussions. =20

DAS 2022 will be held in the historical city of La Rochelle located on the =
French Atlantic coast. La Rochelle is famous for its old port, stunning sea=
side views, urban beaches, and for the second largest private aquarium in E=
urope. Online/virtual participation will also be available for DAS 2022 aut=
hors and participants.

DAS 2022 will accept both full papers (up to 15 pages, presented orally or =
by poster) and short papers (up to 4 pages, presented as posters or demonst=
rations). All paper submissions will undergo a rigorous review process that=
 will consider the originality, quality of work, and presentation of ideas,=
 and relevance to document analysis system research. Springer will publish =
accepted full papers as part of the workshop=E2=80=99s LNCS proceedings, wh=
ile short papers will be published separately in a companion booklet.

 not apply to unpublished technical reports or papers included in self-arch=
ive repositories (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) that are not peer-reviewed.

Short papers
Short papers provide an opportunity to report on research in progress, to p=
resent demos and novel positions on document analysis systems. Authors may =
submit short papers (up to 4 pages in length). Short papers will also under=
go review and will appear in an extra booklet, not in the official DAS2022 =
