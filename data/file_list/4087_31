PhD thesis subject:=20
A generative AI is a machine learning algorithm that can generate =
content such as images or text. They are used in many fields and some of =
them have received a lot of attention from the scientific and general =
public communities. Face image generative AIs can be considered to edit =
an existing face, i.e., to modify the characteristics of a person=E2=80=99=
s face. In this thesis we propose to investigate the editing of facial =
attributes for biometric recognition. The editing of facial attributes =
of the searched person could then allow to improve the performance of =
face recognition by adding or removing facial attributes. The thesis =
work will focus on the de- velopment of new methods for editing facial =
attributes of faces with guarantees regarding the preservation of =
biometric properties. These methods will be applied to improve the =
search for people in databases, by counte- racting possible changes in =
the appearance of faces.

Qualifications:
Candidates must have an MSc or engineering degree in a field related to =
computer science, electrical engineering, or applied mathematics, with =
strong programming skills (in particular with deep learning frameworks). =
Experience with image processing and/or biometrics will be a plus. =
Candidates are expected to have abilities to write scientific reports =
and communicate research results at conferences in English.

Information and application:=20
Applications should include the following documents in electronic format =
: i) A short motivation letter stating why you are interested in this =
thesis, ii) A detailed CV describing your experience / research =
background related to the position iii) The transcripts for master =
degrees. iv) The contact information for three references (do not =
include the reference letters with your applications as we will only ask =
for the reference letters for short-listed candidates). Please send your =
application package by email to the co-advisors.

Location:
The position will start in October 2023, and will be located in Caen, =
France. Ideally located in the heart of Normandy, two hours from Paris =
and just 10 minutes away from the beaches, Caen, William the =
Conqueror=E2=80=99s hometown, is a lively and dynamic city.
