CFP IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2012: Istanbul Turkey 26-29 August 2012 http://asonam2012.etu.edu.tr

Let's socialize where the continents meet!

Full paper submission deadline:   April 15, 2012

IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2012 is jointly sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and ACM SIGMOD
The proceedings will be published by the prestigious IEEE CS â€“ CPS; and will be indexed in IEEE and ACM digital libraries.
Extended versions of the best papers will be invited for publication in the SNAM journal by Springer.

The study of social networks originated in social and business
communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced
significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social
Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the
online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging
systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine
learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social
medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences
and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution.
This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics,
homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known
entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which
actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.

The IEEE/ACM international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis
and Mining (ASONAM 2012) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary
venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a
variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas
and practices. IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2012 is intended to address important aspects
with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs
associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference
solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis
and mining along with their application to real life situations.

General areas of interest to IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2012 include information science
and mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational
studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics,
biology and medicine.

More specialized topics within ASONAM include, but are not limited to:

* Adoption of new services on social network platforms
* Agent based social simulation, agent based computational models
* Anomaly detection in social network evolution
* Application of social network analysis
* Application of social network mining
* Communities discovery and analysis in large scale online social networks
* Communities discovery and analysis in large scale offline social networks
* Connection between biological similarities and social network formulation
* Contextual social network analysis
* Contextual social network mining
* Crime data mining and network analysis
* Cyber anthropology

Important Dates:
April 8, 2012  : Abstract submission deadline (optional, preferred)
April 15, 2012 : Full paper submission deadline
May 20, 2012   : Notification of acceptance
May 31, 2012   : Camera-ready papers due
May 31, 2012   : Presenting author registration due

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining
to the above topics are solicited (Proceeding indexed by EI). Full
paper submission deadline is March 15, 2012. These papers will follow
an academic review process. Full paper manuscripts must be in English
with a maximum length of 8 pages (using the IEEE two-column template).
Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s),
e-mail address(es), tel/fax numbers, abstract, and postal address(es)
on the first page. Papers should be submitted to the Conference Web
site: asonam2012.etu.edu.tr. If Web submission is not possible,
manuscripts should be sent as an attachment via email to
ozyer@etu.edu.tr by March 15, 2012. The attachment must be in PDF or
Word .doc format.

Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness,
significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Authors should
certify that their papers represent substantially new previously
unpublished work. Paper submission implies that the intent is for one
of the authors to present the paper if accepted and that at least one
of the authors will register for a full conference fee.
