The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems
(MEDES 2009)
           Technically sponsored by both ACM SIGAPP and ACM SIGAPP.fr Chapter
                           Technically sponsored by IEEE France & IEEE SMCS
                             with the cooperation of IFIP WG 2.6
                                http://sigappfr.acm.org/medes
                                     October 27-30, 2009
                                        Lyon - France

Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet, the rapid growth and exponential use of digital
medias leads to the emergence of
virtual environments namely digital ecosystems composed of multiple and
independent entities such as individuals,
organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several
missions and focusing on the interactions
and inter-relationships among them. The digital ecosystem exhibits
self-organizing environments, thanks to the
re-combination and evolution of its digital components, in which resources
provided by each entity are properly
conserved, managed and used. The underlying resources mainly comprehend data
management, innovative services,
computational intelligence and self-organizing platforms. Due to the
multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems
and their characteristics, they are highly complex to study and design. This
also leads to a poor understanding as to
how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative and
value-creating. The application of Information
Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities
request resources and ultimately interact to
create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and knowledge.
These technologies can be improved through
novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as data management,
web technologies, networking, security,
human-computer interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and
self-organizing systems to support the establishment
of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems (EDES)
aims to develop and bring together
a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested
in exploring the manifold challenges
and issues related to resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current
approaches and technologies can be
evolved and adapted to this end. The conference seeks related original research
papers, industrial papers and proposals
for demonstrations, and tutorials and workshops.

Topics
-------

We solicit original research and technical papers not published elsewhere. The
papers can be theoretical, practical and application oriented on the following
themes (but not limited to):

- Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
- Web Technologies
- Social Networks
- Data & Knowledge Management Systems
- Multimedia Information Retrieval
- Ontology Management
- Services systems and Engineering
- E-Services , E-Learning, E-Humanities and E-Government
- Emergent Intelligence
- Game Theory
- Networks and Protocols
- Security & Privacy
- Standardization and Extensible Languages
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Business Intelligence
- B2B, B2C, B2A, E-Commerce, E-Business, E-Marketing and E-Procurement
- Digital Library
- Open Source

Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploaded
using the conference website.
Submissions should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail
to comply with length limit
will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer
reviewers. Selection criteria will
include: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and
quality of presentation.
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging
positions on important emergent topics
related to Digital Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference
to present the paper.
The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM
Digital Library.

Important Dates
----------------

- Full Paper submission: June 15, 2009
- Notification of Paper Acceptance: September 5, 2009
- Camera Ready Papers Due and Registration: September 15, 2009
- Conference Dates: October 27-30, 2009

Special issues and Journal Publication

following reviewed journals:

- International Journal on Subject-Centric Computing (IJSCC)
- Journal of Organizational and Collective Intelligence (IJOCI)
- Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence (JETWI)
- International Journal  of Bio-Inspired Computation (IJBIC)
