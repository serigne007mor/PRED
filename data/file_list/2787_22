Artificial Intelligence as a pedagogical tool: Knowledge extraction and 
decision support for the analysis of learners' trajectories in Computer 
Science

******
Context:

In 2018, the University of New Caledonia set up an innovative research 
and teaching centre containing high-tech infrastructure and equipment 
for university training and research. This institutional dynamic 
accompanies and encourages a profound transformation of teaching 
practices in the digital age. While digital tools are nowadays a 
valuable asset for the transmission and evaluation of knowledge, their 
use in the processes of acquisition of this knowledge by the learner 
remains very limited. Indeed, these processes are part of the expertise 
and pedagogical know-how of each teacher whom it would be utopian to 
want to replace with a machine. On the other hand, the real challenge in 
terms of pedagogical innovation consists in designing new digital tools 
that place the teacher at the heart of the system and that facilitate 
the adaptation and individualization of his pedagogy, particularly in 
situations of teaching in large groups or even at a distance.

******
PhD subject:

The thesis takes place in the field of Artificial Intelligence and will 
contribute to the development of fundamental methodologies for knowledge 
extraction and decision support applied to digital humanities for 
education. This will involve exploiting learners' productions in the 
field of computer programming (scripts). These data are by nature very 
complex because of their temporality/sequentiality, their potential 
volume (Big Data) or their polymorphic nature (multiple 
representations). This thesis will seek to remove several major 
scientific obstacles to their analysis with a view to their exploitation 
for the purpose of assisting pedagogical "piloting".

A first work will necessarily focus on the representations of learners' 
productions by the construction or even the automatic extraction of 
descriptors from different levels of analysis (syntactic, semantic, 
structural, etc.). In particular, deep-learning techniques may be 
considered to build a semantic representation space (embedding) on these 
data. The second step will be to define and exploit learners' 
"trajectories" (production sequences) by reconsidering certain 
well-chosen techniques for analyzing classical or even symbolic data in 
a particularly multi-represented context and in a user-centered process. 
Particular attention will be paid to methodologies for clustering 
analysis, detection of atypical trajectories (outliers), projection for 
visualization (dimensionality reduction) or characterization of 
trajectories oriented towards "skills and know-how" (supervised learning).
