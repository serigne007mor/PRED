**** Call for Paper ****

ECML-PKDD 2019 workshop on Advances in Managing and Mining Large Evolving
Graphs
http://leg-ecmlpkdd19.loria.fr
September 20, 2018
W=C3=BCrzburg, Germany

The aim of this third edition of the International Workshop on Advances on
Managing and Mining  Large Evolving Graphs (LEG) is to bring together
active scholars and practitioners of dynamic graphs. Graph models and
algorithms are ubiquitous of a large number of application domains, ranging
from transportation to social networks, semantic web, or data mining.
However, many applications require graph models that are time dependent and
continuously evolving. For example, applications related to urban mobility
analysis employ a graph structure of the underlying road network, where the
travel time is highly dynamic. Indeed, the nature of such networks are
spatiotemporal. Therefore, the time a moving object takes to cross a path
segment typically depends on the starting instant of time. So, we call
time-dependent graphs, the graphs that have this spatiotemporal feature.

In this workshop, we aim to discuss the problem of mining large evolving
graphs, since there are many real world applications dealing with the
volume and the velocity of the graph structure and/or labels. Managing and
analyzing large evolving graphs is very challenging since this requires
sophisticated methods and techniques for creating, storing, accessing and
processing such graphs in a distributed environment, because centralized
approaches do not scale in a Big Data scenario.

Contributions will clearly point out answers to one of these challenges
focusing on large-scale evolving graphs.

*Aims and Scope:*

Many research questions related to mining large scale evolving graphs, will
be at the heart of this workshop such as:

*1. *How to build a LEG using spatio-temporal data or temporal traces in
general, such as to favor the mining process ?
*2. *How to inter-link and enrich LEG with semantic resources during the
mining process ?
*3. *How to allow scalable mining tasks over a LEG ?
*4.* How to organize and maintain a LEG in distributed architecture, such
as to scale the mining process ?

This full-day workshop aims at bringing together scholars and practitioners
active in dynamic graphs, to present and discuss their research, share
their knowledge and experiences, and discuss the current state of the art
and the future improvements.

*Workshop topics:*

We encourage papers with important new insights and experiences on
knowledge discovery aspects with dynamic and evolving graphs. Those
contributions should shed light on one of the questions mentioned above,
related to the knowledge discovery process. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to, the following inter-linked topics, with regards to
mining process:

- Large scale graph analysis
- Theoretical foundation of time-dependent and large scale graphs (LEG)
- Construction and maintenance of LEG
- Algorithms on LEG
- Theoretical foundation of LEG
- Construction and maintenance of LEG
- Data quality in LEG
- Data integration in LEG
- Indexing techniques for LEG
- Distributed algorithms & navigational query processing
- LEG data mining: frequent pattern mining, similarity, cluster analysis,
predictive learning
- Trajectory mining in LEG
- Probabilistic LEG
- Applications related to LEG


*Submission:*

The workshop accepts two types of submissions:
- Long papers (full research papers / ECML-PKDD format). The maximum length
of long papers is 15 pages.
- Short papers of 2-4 pages (for work in progress)
Papers must be formatted and submitted according to the Springer LNCS
guidelines available on:
http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-gui=
delines.

Submissions should be made through EasyChair at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlegecmlpkdd2019.
We also invite the submission of 2-4 pages extended abstracts as highlight
papers or late breaking research papers. Highlight papers should summarize
full papers that have been published, or accepted for publication, between
June 14, 2018 and the submission deadline.

*Review Process:*

Papers will be subject to three (3) blind peer reviews. Selection criteria
include originality of ideas, correctness, clarity and significance of
results and quality of presentation.
Papers will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation. However, no
distinction will be made between accepted papers in the workshop
proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to
attend the conference, as well as the workshop to present the work. Authors
will be required to agree to this requirement at the time of final
submission.

*Workshop Proceedings:*

Workshop proceedings will be published by Springer.

*Important dates:*
- Paper Submission Deadline: June 14, 2019
- Author Notification: July 12, 2019
- Camera Ready Deadline: July 26, 2019

*Workshop registration:*

If a paper is accepted, at least one author must register for the workshop,
and present the paper at the workshop.

*Organizers:*
- Sabeur Aridhi, LORIA, University of Lorraine, Nancy (France)
- Jose Fernandes de Macedo, Universidade Federale do Ceara, Fortaleza
(Brazil)
- Engelbert Mephu Nguifo, LIMOS, University Clermont Auvergne (France)
- Karine Zeitouni, DAVID, Universit=C3=A9 de Versailles Saint-Quentin (Fran=
