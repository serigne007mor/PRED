Call For Papers
---------------

The 12th International ACM Conference on Management of Digital =
EcoSystems (MEDES'20)=20
In-Cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
http://medes.sigappfr.org/20/ <http://medes.sigappfr.org/20/>
November 2nd - 4th, 2020
Abu Dhabi, UAE=20


COVID-19 Announcement
Due to safety and public health concerns, and in order to adapt to the =
newly instated safety measures we announce the following:
1. The submission deadline for MEDES 2020 has been extended (new =
deadline: September 18th 2020).
2. The situation is monitored and appropriate arrangements will be =
considered for the presentations of accepted papers.=20



Description and Objectives
--------------------------
In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and =
exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of =
intelligent environments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the =
web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as =
individuals, organisations, services, software and applications sharing =
one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and =
inter-relationships among them. With the help of the computational =
intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties =
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) =
environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital =
components", in which resources provided by each entity are properly =
conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly =
comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* =
properties platforms. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital =
ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads =
to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower =
digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The =
application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the =
understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact =
to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and =
knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, =
models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web =
technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, =
artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organising systems to =
support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their =
resources. The International Conference on Management of Digital =
EcoSystems (MEDES),previously named "The International Conference on =
Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems", aims to develop and bring =
together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and =
industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues =
related to resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current =
approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end. =
MEDES 2018 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results =
or novel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems. At the same =
time, the conference calls for short papers presenting interesting and =
exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not =
quite ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.

Paper Submission
------------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be =
uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at =
most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with =
length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at =
least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary notification date, authors =
rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiries and their =
comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with =
the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, =
significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of =
presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong =
or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital =
Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present =
the paper. The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and =
indexed by the ACM Digital Library and DBLP. Kindly submit your papers =
by clicking https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020>.
=20

Poster Submission
-------------------

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to present =
early-stage or ongoing research, and to receive valuable feedback from =
conference attendees. We also strongly encourage student and industry =
submissions. Topics of interest are the same as those listed in the main =
conference and special session call for papers. A Best Poster Award will =
be assigned by an independent review committee according to the quality =
of research work and the quality of poster presentation. Authors are =
required to submit a short paper describing the poster content. =
Specifically, this paper should clearly state: (a) the research problem =
being addressed including the current state of the art, (b) what makes =
this problem relevant, important, and challenging, (c) the approach to =
the problem, (d) the key contribution, and (e) the expected results. =
Submitted papers must present original unpublished research that is not =
currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts =
should be prepared in 10-point font using the 2-column ACM conference =
format https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template =
<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template> and may not =
exceed 2 pages, including figures tables (references may extend beyond =
this limit up to 1 more page). All papers should be written in English =
and submitted electronically in PDF format via the submission site =
posted on this page. Notice that authors do not submit the poster, but =
only the short paper describing in text what the poster would present. =
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by a technical program committee and =
will be judged based on their novelty, relevance, technical strength as =
well as the potential to generate discussions. Papers not following =
these guidelines may be rejected without review. Also, submissions =
received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not =
appropriately structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact =
the program chairs for further information or clarification. Papers =
should be submitted electronically by the deadline to =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020>. All accepted =
papers will appear in the conference proceedings. At least one of the =
authors of every accepted poster must register at the conference and =
present the poster at the poster session. The recommended poster size is =
A0 (33.1 x 46.8 in, portrait orientation). The conference does not =
provide any support for printing posters. Typically, authors print their =
posters ahead of the conference.

Special Issues
----------------

Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their =
work to appear in the Internet of Things and WWW journals (more =
information is available on the following link: =
https://medes.sigappfr.org/20/special-issues =
<https://medes.sigappfr.org/20/special-issues>).
