Title of the proposal: Learning from Graph Structure and Node Content
in Large-Scale Random Networks


Keywords: Machine learning, random networks, probabilistic graphical
models, spectral methods, graph mining


Scientific Supervision: Antonino Freno, Marc Tommasi


About Inria and the job:

Inria, with its academic, institutional and industrial partners, is
commited to major research and innovation projects in the field of
computational sciences. The institute disseminates across France
thanks to its eight research centres.

The Inria Lille - Nord Europe research centre, inaugurated in 2008,
employs 357 people, including 250 scientists, in its seventeen
research teams. Recognised for its significant contribution to the
social and economic development of the Nord - Pas-de-Calais region,
the Inria Lille - Nord Europe research centre promotes a policy of
close cooperation with major businesses and small enterprises. By
encouraging synergies between researchers and industrial partners,
Inria contributes to the transfer of skills and expertise in
computational technologies and provides access to top-level European
and international research in order to support innovation and
businesses, particularly in the region of Lille.

Whether designing innovative software for business or logistics,
modelling living cells or fusion plasma, or developing medical
simulators or interfaces to facilitate human-computer interaction, our
research opens up new possibilities that can revolutionise common
practice and contribute to a better understanding of the natural
phenomena which surround us.

The Magnet project aims to design new machine learning based methods
geared towards mining information networks. Information networks are
large collections of interconnected data and documents, such as
citation networks and blog networks among others. For this, we will
define new structured prediction methods based on machine learning
algorithms for graphs. Applications include node classification, link
prediction, clustering and statistical analysis of graphs in browsing,
monitoring and recommender systems, and more broadly large-scale
network mining. Target domains cover social and communication
networks, e-commerce, and bioinformatics. For more information, you
can visit the project homepage athttp://team.inria.fr/magnet/.



Mission:

Due to recent developments of the Web, huge amounts of structured data
are becoming increasingly available, most notably in the form of
random networks [3]. Online exchange of information often tends to
organize itself through some sort of network, where relevant examples
include friendship networks (Facebook), customer-product networks
(Amazon), co-authorship and citation networks (DBLP, Google Scholar).
Massive application of statistical methods is a crucial element of Web
technologies such as search engines, spam filters, or recommender
systems. But although statistical machine learning has achieved a
solid understanding of uncertain and noisy data whenever they can be
formalized as fixed-length feature vectors, we are still far from
reaching a general consensus on the correct way of modeling networks
as statistical objects. As a consequence, a large variety of
statistical models have been proposed recently, but none of them has
been generally adopted as a standard reference.

This project focuses on a novel statistical approach to large-scale
network analysis, based on the Fiedler delta statistic. The Fiedler
delta statistic has been used to develop models of conditional and
joint probability distributions over (large) undirected networks [1,
2]. However, the proposed models only take into account the graphical
structure of the network, ignoring instead the information which is
often enclosed in the nodes. Such information is typically stored as a
vector-space representation of node (text or multimedia) content. The
main goal of the project is to extend the approach based on the
Fiedler delta statistic so as to account both for graph structure and
node content through a unified formalism. In particular, the resulting
model will have to support inference not only at the level of network
links, but also at the level of node features. In other words,
possible uses of the developed model will be not just in link
prediction and graph generation, but also prediction of local
properties of nodes based on partially specified profiles and
connections.


Job offer description:

While the first part of the project will be devoted to investigating
the problem and designing one or more candidate models, a second part
will consist in applying the developed techniques to real-world
challenges such as social network analysis, modeling user profiles and
linking behavior in telecommunication services, and mining
protein-protein interaction data. Large-scale data from renowned ICT
industry labs will be made available to possibly explore the impact of
our results in a real-world setting.

necessary (ideally Java, but not necessarily). Fluency in spoken and
written English is required.


Benefits :
Duration : 16 months
Salary:  2.620,84 Euros gross/month
Monthly salary after taxes : around 2.138 Euros (medical insurance=20
included).
Possibility of French courses
Help for housing
Participation for transportation
Scientific Resident card and help for husband/wife visa

Security and defence procedure : In the interests of protecting its
scientific and technological assets, Inria is a restricted-access
establishment. Consequently, it follows special regulations for
welcoming any person who wishes to work with the institute. The final
acceptance of each candidate thus depends on applying this security
and defense procedure.

For the first selections, please apply before March 2013, 22nd.
