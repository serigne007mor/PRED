Terminology for a networked society:  Recent advances in multilingual knowl=
edge-based resources

Paris, 28-29-30 octobre 2013

http://flores.lipn.univ-paris13.fr/tia2013/

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission: 			21 June 2013
Paper submission (long and short papers): 	28 June 2013
Notification to authors: 			3 September 2013
Final camera-ready paper due: 		23 September 2013
Conference: 				28-30 October 2013



INTRODUCTION and MOTIVATION

TIA 2013 will be the 10th in a series of successful events which, for the m=
ost part, initially took place in the francophone world. Over a period of a=
lmost 20 years =E2=80=93 the first conference was held in 1995 =E2=80=93 TI=
A has increasingly attracted the attention of many researchers and practiti=
oners all over the world, and its work has become truly international.
The aim of TIA 2013 is to provide an overview of the new ways in which mult=
ilingual terminology is present in an ever-increasing networked society, an=
d to pay special attention both to the methods applied in the conceptualiza=
tion of domain knowledge and to the applications and tools that will meet t=
he requirements of e-society. In this way, terminology, linguistics and kno=
wledge engineering provide the basis on which many other disciplines develo=
p their applications such as domain ontologies, natural language processing=
 tools, multilingual knowledge-based tools and web-based linguistic applica=
tions. New approaches to the standardization and to the reuse and integrati=
on of different tools designed to facilitate work in institutions, companie=
s and society in general will be welcome.

The TIA 2013 Conference aims to promote interdisciplinary research focusing=
 on the intersection of different disciplines that deal with terminological=
 aspects and knowledge engineering resources. Papers may address both theor=
etical questions and methodological aspects on these issues, as well as int=
erdisciplinary approaches developed to facilitate convergence and co-operat=
ion in terminological aspects of importance to society.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Terminology and ontology acquisition and management
- Applying pattern recognition to enriching terminological resources
- Lexicons, thesauri and ontologies as semantic resources
- Lexicons and ontologies as means for knowledge transfer
- Reusing, standardizing and merging terminological or ontological resources
- Multilingual terminology extraction
- Multilinguality and multimodality in terminological resources
- Management of language resources

Terminology and knowledge representation
- Ontological semantics and linguistics
- Ontology localization
- Development of multimedia terminological resources
- Terminology alignment in parallel corpora and other lexical resources
- Representation of terms and conceptual relations in knowledge-based appli=
cations
- Comparative studies of terminological resources and/or ontological resour=
ces from different languages, domains and approaches
- Terminological resources in the 21st century
- Harmonization of format and standards in terminological resources

Terminology and ontologies for applications
- Interoperability and reusability in knowledge-based tools and applications
- Models and metamodels in annotating semantic and terminological resources
- New R &D directions in terminology for industrial uses and needs


SUBMISSIONS

TIA 2013 solicits both regular papers, which present significant work, and =
short papers, which typically present work in progress or a smaller, focuse=
d contribution. The program committee may decide to change the category of =
a paper before acceptance. Papers can be written either in English or Frenc=
h.
Regular papers should not exceed 8 pages in ACL-HLT 2011 format (see below =
for LaTeX and MS Word style files), including figures, examples and referen=
ces. The mode of presentation of long papers (orally or as posters) will be=
 decided based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.
Short papers should not exceed 4 pages in the same format as regular papers=
. They will also be presented orally or as posters at the conference depend=
ing on the nature of the work.
Authors should submit the papers in PDF through the TIA submission page at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtia2013=20=20
At the submission page, the author(s) must provide the following informatio=
n:
1. name(s) of author(s)
2. affiliation(s), addresses, fax and e-mail
3. title of the paper
4. 5 to 10 key words in English or in French (in both languages if possible)
5. abstract in English or in French (in both languages if possible) (200 wo=
rds maximum for each)
As the reviewing will be blind, the paper itself must not include the autho=
rs' names and affiliations at submission time. Furthermore, self-references=
 that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 199=
1) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously =
showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Reviews of full papers (long and short) will be =
performed by three reviewers.

STYLES FILES

Authors are required to use the following style files so that the papers fo=
llow the conference format.
Latex: tia2013latex.tgz
MS Word: tia2013word.zip
IMPORTANT: Remove authors=E2=80=99 information from your manuscripts when s=
ubmitting them for blind review (see above)!
