CALL FOR PAPERS

15th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems

NLDB’10

June 23-25, 2010, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, UK

(www.nldb.org)

*******************Important Dates**************************************

Paper submission: January 29, 2010
Notification of acceptance: April 5, 2010
Camera-Ready papers: April 19, 2010

************************************************************************


Since 1995, the NLDB conference has aimed at bringing together researchers, industrials and potential users interested in various applications of Natural Language in the Database and Information System area.
Natural Language Processing has become an important factor in the field of Information and Communication systems in the last years. It has contributed to both improving the development process from the viewpoints of the developers (e.g. the process of requirements engineering, conceptual modelling, validation etc.) and the usability of applications (e.g. natural language query interfaces, retrieval, semantic web etc.)
To underline these inspiring connections, NLDB 2010 will take place from June 23 to June 25 in Cardiff (Wales).


Topics of Interest

NLDB 2010 invites researchers to submit papers on recent, unpublished research on all aspects of Natural Language Processing related to information systems. The Program Committee also encourages people from the industry to submit papers reporting on industrial Natural Language projects. Contributions are welcome in,
but not limited to the following topics:

* Natural Language for Web Information-Intensive Services:
Semantic Information Retrieval, Semantic Web, Semi-structured Models and Associated Languages, Web Usage, Content and Structure Mining for Discovering Semantics, Concept Taxonomies and Web Mining, Learning Taxonomies and Ontologies from the Web, Information Extraction with Machine Learning, Document Classification and Indexation
* Natural Language in Conceptual Modelling:
Analysis of Natural Language Descriptions, Requirement Engineering, Terminological Ontologies, Paraphrasing, Dynamic Modelling, Verification, Consistency Checking, Metadata Harvesting
* Natural Language Interfaces for Data Base Querying/Retrieval:
Natural Languages Interfaces for Database Querying, Verification of Database Queries by Paraphrasing, Semantic Analysis for Information retrieval, NL Interaction with Databases
* Natural-Language-Based Integration of Systems:
Linguistic Aspects of View Integration, Linguistic Aspects of Data Warehouses, Natural Language Queries to Multi-databases systems, Data Integration and Data Cleansing, Ontology driven Integration, Ontology Management
* Large-Scale Online Linguistic Resources:
Electronic Dictionaries, Question-Answer Corpora, Informal Ontologies, Linguistic Databases, Digital Libraries
* Applications of Computational Linguistics in Information Systems:
Multilingual Information Systems, NLP in Requirements Engineering, NLP in Knowledge Management, Ontology driven NLP, Semiotics and Fundamentals
* Management of Textual Databases:
