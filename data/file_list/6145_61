Subject: [liste-egc] PhD position in the AIstroSight team, Lyon, France,
 from November 2023.

{Sorry for multiple receptions: the deadline is approaching but your 
application is still possible and welcomed}

Dear all,

A funded PhD position is available in the AIstroSight team, INRIA, Lyon, 
France (https://team.inria.fr/aistrosight/), starting in November 2023. 
Our interdisciplinary team aims at developing innovative numerical 
methods for the search of new drug candidates to treat brain diseases, 
targeting neurons as well as glial cells. We value diversity, trust, 
growth, equity and creativity.

Project title: Partial differential equation discovery for 
spatio-temporal simulations in cells.

The goal of this PhD project is to develop a data-driven partial 
differential equation (PDE) discovery method for complex dynamical 
systems such as brain cells. The algorithm will be evaluated on its 
ability to robustly and accurately learn cell function at the 
macroscopic scale from data simulated at the nanoscopic level.

See subject details here: 
https://team.inria.fr/aistrosight/files/2023/06/PDE_Discovery_AIstroSight_2023.pdf

Candidate profile
We are looking for a student with a Master degree who has experience in 
at least one of the following areas: data science/machine 
learning/mathematical modeling as well as an interest in cell 
biology/neuroscience. Proficiency in written and oral English is 
required. No knowledge of French is needed. Most importantly, we are 
looking for future colleagues who are eager to learn and grow, and who 
are driven by scientific curiosity.

If you want to apply, please reach out to thomas.guyet@inria.fr, 
audrey.denizot@inria.fr, and hugues.berry@inria.fr with a one-page 
statement presenting your interests and goals, a CV and the contact 
information of at least 2 referees.

Application deadline: June 26th 2023.

Do not hesitate to transfert this announce to anybody who could be 
interested.


Audrey, Hugues and Thomas
