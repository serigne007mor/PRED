Special Issue on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems

Guest Editor: Abdelkader Hameurlain, IRIT, Paul Sabatier University, France
E-mail: hameur@irit.fr            



Scope

The Grid and P2P systems hold a more and more important position in the 
landscape
of the reserach on large scale distributed systems and the applications 
that require
effective management of voluminuos, distributed,and hetergeneous data. 
This important
comes out of characteristics offered by these systems: the autonomy and 
the dynamicity
of peers, the decentralization of control, and the effective and 
transparent sharing of
large-scale distributed resources. Today, the Grid and P2P 
systems,intended initialy for
the intensive computing and sharing files, open towards the management 
of voluminuos,
distributed, and hetergeneous data on a large scale environment. The 
management of these
data on these systems raises new problems and presents new challenges.

The objective of this special issue on Data Management in Grid and P2P 
Systems
is to collect information on cutting-edge research, to identify new 
issues, and
to shape future directions.
