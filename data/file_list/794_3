Second Call for Workshop Proposals

The 8th International Conference on
Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'07) Nancy, France, December 4-8 2007 http://wise2007.loria.fr/ 

The Program Committee of the The 8th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'07) invites proposals for workshops.  The Workshops will be held at the beginning of the conference, December 4, 2007 at Nancy, France. 

The workshop organizers will be responsible for advertising the workshop, forming the program committee, reviewing and selecting the papers, and guaranteeing a high quality workshop, worthy of the prestige and range of the conference. Workshop organizers need to make sure that each submitted paper will receive at least two reviews. The proceedings of WISE 2007 will be published in two separate volumes by Springer in its Lecturer Notes in Computer Science series (which is indexed by SCI): one volume for the papers accepted by the main conference and one volume for all papers accepted by WISE workshops. 

The workshop organizers will also have the discretion of editing selected papers (after their expansion and revision) into books or special journal issues.  Workshops may be full-day or half-day. A full-day workshop should select 12-15 regular papers, while a half-day workshop should select 6-8 regular papers, from a large number of submissions.  The workshop organizers ensure the presence of authors of accepted papers at the workshops.

I. Workshop Topics

Workshop subjects will focus on new research challenges and initiatives in Web Information Systems Engineering, as mentioned in the WISE’07 CFP. The workshops should provide an informal and vibrant forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their research results and practical development experiences in the relevant fields.   

II. Workshop Proposal Submission

Workshop proposals should include the following elements: 

- Title of the workshop
- Your name, affiliation, mailing address and e-mail address
- A description of the workshop topic (not exceeding 200 words)
- Type of the workshop (full-day or half-day)
- A description of how the workshop will contribute to the field of
  Web Information System Engineering
- A short description on how the workshop will be advertised so as
  to ensure a sufficiently wide range of submissions and high quality contributions

Please send your workshop proposal to both Workshop Co-Chairs

After the acceptation of a workshop proposal the organizer(s) should:

- Create a "Call for papers/participation" for the workshop
- Create a Web page for the workshop, the link of which will be published on the WISE’07 Conference Web site
- Create a Board of Reviewers (Workshop Program Committee)
- Review and select papers
- Organize the creation of the final versions
- Schedule the workshop activities
