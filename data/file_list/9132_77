Subject: [liste-egc] The 1st Summer School on Smart Cities and Linked Open
 Data


The 1st Summer School on Smart Cities and Linked Open Data (LD4SC-15)
Cercedilla (near Madrid, Spain), June 7-12, 2015

http://smartcity.linkeddata.es/LD4SC/

*Registration deadline: 15th March*

The 1st Summer School on Smart Cities and Linked Open Data (LD4SC-15)
will be held from June 7th to 12th 2015 at Residencia Lucas Olazabal of
Universidad Politecnica de Madrid in Cercedilla, a municipality of the
autonomous community of Madrid in central Spain.

The LD4SC-15 summer school has the main goal of teaching people from
industry and academia in an easy and guided way how to use Linked Open
Data technologies in the domain of smart cities, facilitating through a
simple approach a first contact with these technologies. This summer
school is the first one organized in this topic worldwide and is
supported by the READY4SmartCities (http://www.ready4smartcities.eu/)
FP7 Coordination and Support Action.

By the end of the summer school, students will:
* Understand the role of Open Data and Linked Open Data in Smart cities.
* Know how to generate and publish Open Linked Data from some existing
data source.
* Know how to define and reuse vocabularies that can be used to
represent Linked Data.
* Know about the different existing open data portals and be able of
using them.
* Know the different alternatives for using Linked Data in the context
of smart cities.
* Have followed the whole process of generating and publishing Open
Linked Data with some existing data set.

With the objective of avoiding passive learning, the summer school will
contain three types of lessons:

* Keynotes to show novel aspects and discuss selected topics.
* Theoretical lessons to introduce the basic foundations of each topic,
methods, and technologies.
* Hands-on sessions where students will follow the whole process of
generating and publishing Open Linked Data with some existing data set.

Students are encouraged to bring to the summer school some data set
produced by their organizations in order to leave the summer school with
the data set transformed into Linked Data.
