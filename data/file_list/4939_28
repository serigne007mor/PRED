First International Workshop on Latest Advances in Enterprise Architectures=
 in the IoT Era (EAIoT'2021)

http://eaiot2021.connect.rs

In conjunction with IEEE EDOC'21 (http://ieee-edoc.org/2021/)

Gold Coast, Australia, October 25, 2021

Note : We have assured SI in Springer Cluster Computing journal (Q1 in info=
rmation science, Q2 in computer science) after Workshops..

CALL FOR PAPERS

Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and Commun=
ication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all perspective=
s (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and competitiveness) forcing them t=
o review their functional and non-functional practices. According to the In=
ternational Data Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compo=
und annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 tri=
llion within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT devic=
es by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the Internet by 2023=
.

To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design principles and=
 foundations of organizations' enterprise architectures are expected to adj=
ust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into these architectures' foundat=
ions namely organization, business, information, application, and technolog=
y. Aiming at examining these foundations separately and then collectively, =
this workshop is an open forum for discussions between academics and indust=
ry partners about the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field=
 of enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the lack=
 of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to integrate Io=
T into the life cycle of designing, developing, and deploying enterprise ar=
chitectures. This integration should lead to a new generation of enterprise=
 architectures that would foster not only a deeper retrospect on the involv=
ed interactive digital resources inside the life cycle covering data collec=
tion, information analysis, knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but =
also a better understanding of potential threats as well as the development=
 of new ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the=
 competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial Inte=
lligence (AI) trend.

Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that enterprises cou=
ld tap into, there are also obstacles that could undermine these opportunit=
ies, on the other hand. Some of these obstacles are lack of standards that =
cover both enterprise architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially=
 exist in IoT devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security,=
 and privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational capabili=
ties, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT in a machine-u=
nderstandable manner, just to mention some.

Topics of Interest

This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both discipli=
nes enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise architecture) and IoT te=
chnologies to discuss how enterprises could capitalize on these technologie=
s so, that, a new generation of business processes could spread over the em=
ergent network of IoT. Topics for discussions include, but are not limited =
to:
-- Standards for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
-- Enterprise architecture for Industry 4.0.
-- Data science for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
-- Semantic technologies for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
-- Agentification of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
-- Interoperability inside and between IoT-based enterprise architecture.
-- Guidelines and best practices for IoT-based enterprise architecture
-- Privacy, trust, and security of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
-- Context management and awareness for IoT-based enterprise architecture
-- Case studies related to IoT-based enterprise architecture.
