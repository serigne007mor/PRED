The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of =
Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) includes a PhD student Forum o=
n machine learning and data mining.=20

The purpose of this forum is to provide an environment specifically for jun=
ior PhD students to exchange ideas and experiences with peers in an interac=
tive atmosphere and to get constructive feedback from senior researchers in=
 machine learning, data mining, and related areas.=20

The focus of the discussion at the PhD Forum would be the work in progress =
of junior PhD students, with 1-3 years of research experience towards their=
 dissertation.=20

During the forum, researchers with experience in supervising and examining =
doctoral students will participate and provide constructive feedback and ad=
vice to the participants.=20

It is an excellent opportunity for developing person-to-person networks to =
the benefit of the PhD students in their future careers.=20

Tentative Schedule=20

- Invited =E2=80=9Cexperience sharing=E2=80=9D talks by senior researchers.=
=20
- Topic-based sessions with lightning talks from the students, and feedback=

The ECMLPKDD PhD Forum spans various topics of data mining, machine learnin=
g, and work in related fields such as databases, artificial intelligence, s=
tatistics, information retrieval, multimedia and the Web. Topics in specifi=
c domains such as bioinformatics and the more general science informatics a=
re also encouraged. Participants with interdisciplinary work across the are=
as are particularly welcome.=20

mportant, 3) why existing solutions in literature are insufficient, 4) how =
your approach works, and 5) optionally some preliminary experiments (4 page=
s, max 6 pages).=20

The purpose is to obtain feedback regarding future plans, and technical fee=
dback on topic and writing.=20

Note that:=20

- For work in progress papers, the only criterion for acceptance is that th=
e submission is clearly structured and written in English language, and tha=
t it is of sufficient maturity to enable the audience of the PhD forum to p=
rovide constructive feedback.=20

ut, they will be made publicly available through the conference website.=20
- All accepted papers will be presented in short format (5 minutes) + quest=
ions.=20
- The first author must be a PhD student who is less than 4 years into his =
PhD. Co-authors may include the research advisors, committee members, and o=
ther collaborators as needed.=20
- The PhD student must register for the conference and be present at the Ph=
D Forum.=20
- We will ask each PhD student to participate in the review process by revi=
ewing one paper.=20
