Subject: [liste-egc] First Call for papers - Special Issue "Predictive
 Analytics and Illicit Activities" - May 2021

Call for papers : a special issue of Information journal (ISSN 2078-2489)
"Predictive Analytics and Illicit Activities"
https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/predictive_anallytics_illicit

Deadline for manuscript submissions: 31 May 2021.

This Special Issue focuses on the use of advanced techniques to mine and 
exploit heterogeneous digital data on illicit activities for descriptive 
or predictive analyses.

Digital technologies as well as digital information and communication 
networks facilitate illicit activities such as illicit financial flows, 
illicit art and drug markets, forbidden posts and comments on social 
media, and recruitment or incitement of illicit activities such as any 
form of radicalization, etc. New models, methods and tools need to be 
developed to prevent, detect or warn, and possibly mitigate or hinder 
these illicit actions.

These methods encompass machine learning or data mining models as well 
as visualization models to help in detecting or mitigating possible 
illicit activities.

This Special Issue aims to gather both research papers reporting new 
scientific results and technical papers reporting project results, 
demos/prototypes/tools.

This Special Issue invites submissions covering, but not limited to, the 
following topics:

- Crime detection and investigation;
- Risk analysis;
- Misinformation and misbehavior analysis and detection;
- Trend detection, analysis and tracking;
- Weak signal detection;
- Information / opinion / knowledge spread and modelling;
- Information quality in social network;
- Community detection, expertise and authority discovery;
- Social influence, recommendation and media;
- Behavior analysis in social networks;
- Sentiment analysis;
- Network visualization and modeling;
- Data mining and machine learning;
- Real-world case studies;
- Ongoing projects based on social media and/or social networks;
- Ethics.

published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be 
listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review 
articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned 
papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the 
Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be 
under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference 
proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a 
single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant 
information for submission of manuscripts is available on the
