Context:
This PhD is in a joint project of the Laboratoire Hubert Curien 
(Saint-Etienne University) and the LIRIS laboratory (INSA Lyon). It is 
the subject of an application for ANR (French national research fund) 
and a cooperative action within the Web Intelligence project supported 
by the cluster ISLE of the Rhône Alpes region.

Funding:
The subject is likely to be funded by the cluster ISLE of the Rhône 
Alpes region
Amount: about 1700 euros gross monthly for 3 years

Candidate profile:
Having a MSc or a Master in engineering degree in computer science at 
the end of the academic year 2008-2009. Skills in data mining, 
information retrieval, graph based representation network analysis would 
be appreciated. An excellent level in English or French is also required.

Summary of the subject:
The recent explosion of Web 2.0 opens up new perspectives for sharing 
and managing information, allowing the collaborative construction of 
content and development of open social networks. It is based on graph 
theory that the analysis of social networks is first studied including 
the participants and their interactions. But, in the context of the web, 
these approaches turn out to be insufficient because of the new network 
features.
In this PhD thesis, we intend to exploit the contextual information to 
enrich the description of both the actors and their relationships. In 
this perspective, data mining techniques can be used to extract 
knowledge from the graph itself but also textual information produced by 
the actors. The aim of this thesis is firstly to represent the social 
scientific network in an optimized way to exploit different linked 
information. After, based on the research we have carried out in text 
mining to develop knowledge extraction methods to better understand the 
network. The results will allow to construct indicators characterizing 
the actors, groups of actors or the network itself and to monitor their 
evolution. These indicators will be integrated into a scientific 
community management framework.
