CALL FOR PAPERS
1st INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL & DATA ENGINEERING (MEDI’2011)
September 28-30, 2011
ÓBIDOS MEDIEVAL OLD VILLAGE CENTER
ÓBIDOS – Portugal

IMPORTANT DATES
Abstract submission: April 10th
Full-paper submission: April 20th
Acceptance notification: June 15th

The First International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held from 28 to 30 September 2011 in Óbidos – Portugal. The main 
objective of our conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination 
of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and 
collaboration between the models and data research communities. 
MEDI’2011 provides an international platform for the presentation of 
research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies 
related to models and data and their advanced applications. This 
international scientific event, initiated by researchers from 
Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of 
north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.
All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
Topics on interest include but not limited to:
  Models Engineering
* Design of General-purpose Modelling Languages and Related Standards
* Model Driven Engineering, Modelling Languages, Meta-modelling, Model 
Transformation, Model Evolution,
* Formal Modelling, Verification and Validation, Analysis, Testing
* Ontology Based Modelling, Role of Ontologies in Modelling Activities
* Model Manipulation
Data Engineering
* Data Integration, Interoperability
* Distributed, Parallel, Grid, Peer to Peer, Cloud Databases
* Data Warehouses and OLAP, Data Mining
* Database System Internals, Performance, Self-tuning  Benchmarking and 
Testing
* Database Security, Personalization, Recommendation
* Web Databases, Ontology Based Databases, PDMS
  Modeling for Data Management
* New Models and Architectures for Databases and Data Warehouses
* Modeling and Quality of Data
* Modeling for Enhancing Sharing Data
* Models for Explicit and Implicit Semantics based Data Optimization
* Model Reification, Model Repositories
* Modeling Non Functional Properties of Systems
* Urbanization of Database Applications
Applications and tooling
* Industry transfer, case studies, experiences
* Data and Model manipulation and tooling
PAPER SUBMISSION DETAILS
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers 
representing original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be 
submitted in PDF or Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's 
LNCS format and should not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, 
references and appendices). Authors who want to buy extra pages may 
submit a paper up to 15 pages with the indication that the authors will 
purchase extra pages if the paper is accepted. Submissions which do not 
conform to the LNCS format and/or which do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 
pages with the extra page purchase commitment) will be rejected without 
reviews. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on 
originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of 
exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
Duplicate submissions are not allowed. A submission is considered to be 
a duplicate submission if it is submitted to other 
conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already accepted to be 
published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions 
thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require 
explicit consent from all listed authors.

LOCATION
Óbidos is a Medieval walled town where time has passed it by. Within the 
extensive walls there are narrow cobbled streets, houses painted white 
with blue or yellow trim, flower boxes and old lamp lights. There are 
many churches and chapels among the houses. The castle is located at the 
highest point. Once the wedding present of a queen, the preserved 
medieval town of Óbidos and the surrounding land was always the property 
of the queens of Portugal.  Encircled by a ring of medieval walls and 
crowned by the Moorish castle.  Inside the walls, which at sunset take 
on a golden coloring, one can sense a cheerful medieval ambience of 
winding streets, old whitewashed houses bordered with blue or yellow, 
Manueline embrasures and windows. Óbidos is located about 80 km north of 
Lisbon.
Besides its material heritage of the past, Óbidos, a melting pot of 
historical tradition is still today one of the main jewels of the 
country. More information about Óbidos, 
http://bit.ly/obidos_information. Welcome to Óbidos!
Selected conference hotels are located inside the old fort walls.
Conference sessions will be organized along different municipal 
buildings inside the medieval wall ring, allowing to participants to 
enjoy the villa costumes.
