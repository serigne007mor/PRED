SCOPE

During the last decades Computational Intelligence (CI) has emerged and 
showed its contributions in various broad research communities (computer 
science, engineering, finance, economic, decision making, etc.). This 
was done by proposing approaches and algorithms based either on turnkey 
techniques belonging to the large panoply of solutions offered by CI 
such as data mining, genetic algorithms, bio-inspired methods, Bayesian 
networks, machine learning, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, 
etc. or inspired by CI techniques to develop new ad-hoc algorithms for 
the problem under consideration.

The main objective of our special issue is not to cover the 
contributions of the CI in all domains, but in the particular field of 
computer science which is Information Systems (IS). ISs are repositories 
where sensitive and crucial data are recorded to support day-to-day 
company applications and decision making processes. Building such 
systems usually passes through several complex steps: (a) requirement 
analysis, (b) design, (c) implementation, (d) testing, (e) evolution and 
(f) tuning. Moreover, two other crucial aspects should be taken into 
account when building IS: (1) the big data dimension and (2) the 
advanced deployment platforms such as cloud that comes with interesting 
economical aspects and models. Under these situations, SI building is a 
time consuming process. To reduce this complexity and to propose 
companies and organization IS with a high quality, the incorporation of 
CI techniques in the lifecycle of IS may represent a key issue for 
researchers and industrials.

This special issue is open to researchers from both academia and 
industry consumer of CI. The aim of this special issue of the Computing 
Journal, Springer is twofold. The first one is to present new and 
challenging issues in the contribution of CI for designing high quality 
and efficient IS. The second one is to present new research and 
technological developments that use CI all over the life cycle of IS.
