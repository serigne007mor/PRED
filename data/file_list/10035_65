*Session on "Ontologies for Decision Making" at KES 2012*

This session is part of KES-2012 (http://kes2012.kesinternational.org/), 
the 16th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent 
Information & Engineering Systems, that will be held in San Sebastian, 
Spain, the 10, 11 & 12 September 2012.

Decision making can be regarded as a cognitive process resulting in the 
selection of a course of action among several alternative scenarios. 
Every decision making process produces a final choice. The output can be 
an action or an opinion of choice.
More and more software intended to assist decision-making processes is 
being developed on the formal description of concepts and relationships 
among concepts in the domain; that is, developed with an underlying 
ontology to have a formal model of the domain, or to assist the decision 
process.
The objective of this session is to present and compare different 
approaches to real applications of ontologies at the heart of 
decision-making systems.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to presentation of 
developments in the following areas:
.    intelligent diagnosis systems (medical, organizational, ... )
.    image analysis systems
.    enterprise information systems
.    geographic information systems,
.    industrial applications of ontology extraction from DB or from texts,
.    industrial problems where ontology alignment is needed,
.    among others ..

The papers will be reviewed by the KES International Program Committee. 
The best submissions will be selected for presentation and will be 
included in the symposium proceedings. The papers should present 
original and unpublished research. The symposium proceedings are planned 
to be published and distributed by Springer-Verlag in series LNCS/LNAI. 
Submitted papers for session should be prepared in LNCS/LNAI style and 
should be limited to 10 pages. All submissions must be sent 
electronically using the PROSE software review system 
(http://kes2012.kesinternational.org/).
A selected number of accepted and personally presented papers will be 
expanded and revised for possible inclusion in special issues in the 
several prestigious international journals.

*Important dates*
.    Submission of papers : April 1st
.    Notification of acceptance: May 1st
.    Receipt of publication files : June 1st
.    Early / Authors Registration Deadline: June 11th
Every paper must have at least one author who has registered for the 
conference with payment by the Early Registration Deadline for the paper 
to appear in the proceedings. Any paper that does not have at least one 
author who has registered and paid by the Early / Authors Registration 
Deadline will be withdrawn from the Springer proceedings.
