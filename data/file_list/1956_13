/GIA : GeoInformation Analysis/

/Technical track at the 36th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing
Gwangju, Korea
March 22-March 26, 2021
/

*IMPORTANT DATES:*

Sept 15, 2020 : Submission of regular papers and SRC research abstract

/Track Description:
The production and use of geo-referenced digital resources is expanding 
rapidly. In order to exploit their contents, the documents are 
annotated, indexed and analyzed according to data models dedicated to 
the description of particular domains. The multiple dimensions of data 
descriptors can be divided into three categories: location (spatial 
dimension), date/time (temporal dimension), and theme (thematic 
dimension). Data consisting of these multi-dimensional characteristics 
are considered as geographical data.
In recent years, a variety of works have highlighted the potential of 
the extraction, analysis and retrieval of geographic information in 
corpora composed of textual documents, images and maps. A number of 
engines and services dedicated to the search for geographical 
information have been proposed: they mostly cover spatial information 
but some include spatio-temporal and thematic information.
The purpose of this Track is to bring together the growing community of 
professionals and researchers in the field of geographic information 
extraction, retrieval and analysis, and of the corresponding 
applications. The GIA track is at the crossroads of several disciplines: 
of course, geomatics, but also Knowledge Engineering (KE), natural 
languages processing (NLP), data mining (DM), information extraction 
(IE) and data visualization (Dataviz).
/

/Topics:
How to effectively exploit the power of geographical information 
available on the Web, through the
thematic, spatial and temporal dimensions? How to use the 
complementarity of external knowledge
resources? These questions highlight a non-exhaustive list of themes 
considered for GIA track:
• Preparation of Geographical Data
o Identification of resources and of data (texts, images, etc.);
o Data Modeling (spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal and thematic data);
o Considering specific characteristics: heterogeneity, volumetry, mono 
or multidimensionality.
• Geographical knowledge Extraction
o Construction and Acquisition of spatial/temporal/thematic Knowledge;
o Qualitative approaches (expert annotation, etc.) and quantitative 
approaches (data mining, NLP, etc.).
• Geographical Data Analytics
o Single or multi-Dimensional Data Analysis (interpretation and data 
enrichment),
o Quality measurements on spatial and temporal data;
• Geovizualisation
o Tools and techniques supporting the analysis of geospatial data 
through the use of
interactive visualization;
• Evaluation of spatial and temporal tools, resources and knowledge;
• Uses, methods and issues in Humanities and Social Sciences topics: 
geography, health,
history, archeology, sociology, etc./

/
/

/Submission guidelines:
Regular papers: Original papers addressing any of the listed topics of 
interest (or related topics) will be considered. Each submitted paper 
will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least 
three referees. Paper size is limited to 8 pages.   All reviews will be 
double-blind: authors'names and affiliations must not appear in the 
paper, self-citations should be in the third person, and authors must 
avoid disclosing their identity by any means. /
/
/

/Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the 
paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy 
attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the 
paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show of 
registered papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM 
digital library./

/Paper submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via the SAC 
2021 website: http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/.
Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed.
Student Research Competition: Graduate students are invited to submit 
research abstracts (maximum 4 pages) to the Student Research Competition 
(SRC).  The details Student Research Competition can be found on the SAC 
website: http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/.
