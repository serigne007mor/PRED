THE 11TH SEMANTIC WEB SUMMER SCHOOL - SSSW 2015
Now in Bertinoro, near Bologna, Italy.
5-11 July, 2015
http://sssw.org/2015, contact@sssw2015.org<mailto:contact@sssw2015.org>, Tw=
itter: @sssw2015

(Provisional) programme: http://sssw.org/2015/programme/
New deadline for applications: 2nd April 2015

The groundbreaking SSSW series of summer schools started in 2003. It is now=
 a well-established event within the research community and a role model fo=
r several other initiatives. After 10 years in Cercedilla, Spain, SSSW is c=
oming back in 2015 to a new location =E2=80=93 Bertinoro, Italy =E2=80=93 a=
nd a new programme centred on research and the open challenges facing the s=
emantic web and the related technologies. As always, the summer school incl=
udes lectures, invited talks, practical research work and projects, led by =
a set of tutors comprising leading researchers in the community and prestig=
ious invited speakers. SSSW also represents a unique opportunity for networ=
king with research and industry leaders, including of course, an exciting s=
ocial programme in one of the most beautiful locations in Italy.

Applications to attend SSSW 2015 will close on the 27th March 2015. To appl=
y, please follow the instructions at http://sssw.org/2015/how-to-apply/. To=
 ensure a high ratio between tutors and students the school will be limited=
 to 60 participants.

In 2013, SSSW celebrated its 10th edition and its 10 year anniversary, demo=
nstrating through the quality of the content, the great environment and the=
 amazing engagement of the some of the brightest young researchers in the a=
rea as students that it remains the premier educational event in our resear=
ch community. In 2015, SSSW is entering a new phase: As the technologies ev=
olved and the Semantic Web is getting mature, the focus of the school is al=
so evolving to cover the open research challenges that are being faced by t=
he scientific community related to the Semantic Web.

Keeping the =E2=80=9Cmixed=E2=80=9D approach pioneered in the previous edit=
ions of SSSW, invited talks and lectures by some of the greatest researcher=
s in the area are now complemented with =E2=80=9CResearch in Practice=E2=80=
=9D sessions where key research questions are being investigated and collec=
tively discussed. A wide range of skills are required when working in this =
area. Therefore the summer school also includes a =E2=80=9Chackday=E2=80=9D=
, as a break from the research focus where participants will be able to app=
ly and show off their technical skills too. SSSW 2015 will provide a stimul=
ating and enjoyable environment in which participants will benefit not only=
 from the formal and practical sessions but also from informal and social i=
nteractions with established researchers and the other participants to the =
school. To further facilitate interaction and exchange of ideas, a poster s=
ession will also take place, which will provide an opportunity for attendee=
s to present and obtain feedback on their research.

HOW TO APPLY

Please follow the instructions http://sssw.org/2015/how-to-apply/
When filling up the application form, it is important to keep in mind that =
the main selection criterion is motivation to attend the summer school.

We welcome applicants from anywhere in the world. Normally, but not exclusi=
vely, applicants will be postgraduate students in relevant disciplines with=
 some knowledge of semantic and web technologies. Some basic acquaintance w=
ith knowledge representation languages for the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, etc.=
) is required.

The deadline for applications has been extended to 2nd April 2015.

Accepted candidates are expected to arrive on Sunday, July 5th, between 3pm=
 and 6pm and to participate fully in the activities of the school until its=
 conclusion, at 2pm on Saturday, July 11th. Applicants should keep in mind =
that we will not consider applications from students who cannot commit them=
selves to a full participation for the whole duration of the school. Studen=
ts are also required to bring and present a poster at the summer school, de=
scribing their own research. Please also be aware that most students will b=
e required to share a room with one other student.

Apart from activities directly related to lectures, the summer school sched=
ule is rightly famous for its unrivalled social programme, which enables in=
formal interaction between all participants to the school - i.e., students,=
 tutors, invited speakers, school staff, etc. These events include a gala d=
inner, picnic at the swimming pool, a disco, and sport activities.

STUDENT GRANTS

We expect to provide a number of grants for students who would not otherwis=
e be able to attend the school. More details about student grants will be p=
ublished at a later date.

VENUE AND ACCOMMODATION

SSSW 2015 will be at the University Residential Center located in the small=
 medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro. This town is in Emilia Romagna, about =
50km east of Bologna at an elevation of 230m above sea level. It can easily=
 be reached by train and taxi from Bologna.

Bertinoro is picturesque, with many narrow streets and walkways winding aro=
und the central peak. Sessions of the summer school will be held in an arch=
iepiscopal castle that has been converted by the University of Bologna into=
 a modern conference centre with computing facilities and Internet access. =
From the castle you can enjoy a beautiful vista that stretches from the Tus=
can Apennines to the Adriatic coast and the Alps over the Po Valley.

More information about the location will be available at http://sssw.org/20=
15/venue-details/
