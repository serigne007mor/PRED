W1: Statistical and Relational Learning and Mining in Bioinformatics
(StReBio'09)

Organizers: Jan Ramon, Fabrizio Costa, Christophe Costa Florencio,
Joost Kok

Submission deadline: 20-Apr
Challenge: Yes
URL: http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/events/StReBio09/

Summary: Bioinformatics is an application domain where information is
naturally represented in terms of relations between heterogenous
objects. Modern experimentation and data acquisition techniques allow
the study of complex interactions in biological systems. This raises
interesting challenges because the amount of data is huge,some
information can not be observed, and measurements may be noisy. The
StReBio'09 workshop invites contributions concerning applications of
statistical relational learning and mining methods in bio-informatics
domains. In particular, the workshop invites both regular papers,
problem statements and problem solution papers.

Summary: The goal of Visual Analytics is to derive insight from
massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting data; detect the
expected and discover the unexpected; provide timely, defensible, and
understandable assessments; and communicate the assessment effectively
for action. The goal of this workshop is to raise the awareness of the
KDD community for the importance of Visual Analytics and bring
together researcher from the underlying fields to bridge the gap
between them—to write a KDD research roadmap on Visual Analytics.

Ipeirotis, Edith Law, Foster Provost, Anton Mityagin, Luis von Ahn

Submission deadline: 18-Apr
URL: http://www.hcomp2009.org/

Summary: Human computation is a new research area that studies the
process of channeling the vast internet population to perform tasks or
provide data towards solving difficult problems that no known computer
algorithms can yet solve perfectly and efficiently, e.g. digitize
books, recognize objects in images and songs, translate sentences,
summarize news articles, annotate videos etc. The goal of HCOMP 2009
is to bring together academic and industry researchers in a
stimulating discussion of existing human computation applications,
such as Games With A Purpose (e.g. the ESP game), Mechanical Turk and
CAPTCHAs, and future directions of this new subject area. Included in
the workshop are invited talks, presentations, posters, and a demo
session where participants are invited to showcase their human
computation applications.
