Subject: [liste-egc] Young investigator positions at the Institute for
 Computational Biology of Montpellier (France)

Objet : Young investigator position at the Institute for Computational
Biology of Montpellier (France)

The Institute for Computational Biology (IBC) will hire five young
investigators for each of the five work-packages, typically with a PhD plus
3-year post-doc and solid experience in international research, a high level
of publishing, strong communication abilities, and a taste for
multidisciplinary research. Working full-time at IBC, these young
researchers will play a key role in Institute life. They will actively
participate in receiving foreign researchers and organizing seminars and
events (schools, conferences...). They will help coordinate work within the
work-packages and will be at the forefront of producing deliverables. In
exchange, these young researchers will benefit from an exceptional
environment thanks to the presence of numerous leading international
researchers, not to mention significant autonomy for their work. These
positions are open for up to 4 years, with a net monthly salary of 2,350
Euros/month, which is approximately 300 Euros more than a standard post-doc
salary in France, and clearly enough to live in the Montpellier area.


Work-package Biological data and knowledge integration:

This project aims at the design and implementation of a data management
framework for plant genomics. Addressing the problem of data and knowledge
integration at a large scale, with high numbers of distributed data sources
and processes, is a major challenge. The project plans to address this
challenge by pursuing two complementary research directions: (1) data
integration using metadata and ontologies to merge data coming from
different sources, with different formats and semantics. (2) distributed
workflow execution involving distributed processes and large amounts of
heterogeneous data, with support of data provenance (lineage) to understand
data results.=20
The basis for the project will be the BioSemantic
(http://southgreen.cirad.fr/?q=3Dcontent/BioSemantic) and WebSmatch
(http://websmatch.gforge.inria.fr) prototypes.

We are seeking a candidate with strong experience in distributed data
management, in particular data integration, a good grasp on implementation
aspects and interest for biology applications.

Key-words: data integration, (bio) ontologies, semantic web, semantic
indexing, linked data, plant genomics data
