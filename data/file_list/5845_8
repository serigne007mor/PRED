13th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems=
 (FOIS 2023)
     September 18-20, 2023 (Online)

Definition and scope
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The FOIS conference is a meeting point for all researchers with an inte=
rest in formal ontology. Formal ontology is the systematic study of the=
 types of entities and relations making up the domains of interest repr=
esented in modern information systems. FOIS 2023 will have distinct tra=
cks for foundational issues, ontology applications and methods, and dom=
ain ontologies. FOIS aims to be a nexus of interdisciplinary research a=
nd communication for researchers from many domains engaging with formal=
 ontology. Common application areas include conceptual modeling, databa=
se design, knowledge engineering and management, software engineering, =
organizational modeling, artificial intelligence, robotics, computation=
al linguistics, the life sciences, bioinformatics and scientific resear=
ch in general, geographic information science, information retrieval, l=
ibrary and information science, as well as the Semantic Web.

FOIS is the flagship conference of the International Association for On=
tology and its Applications (IAOA: http://iaoa.org/), which is a non-pr=
ofit organization promoting interdisciplinary research and internationa=
l collaboration in formal ontology.
