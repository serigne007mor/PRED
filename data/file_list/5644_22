SYMPOSIUM HISTORY
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The 1st Foundations & Practice of Security (FPS) Symposium was held in
2008, following the Canada-France Meeting on Security held at the
Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, on December 06-08, 2007.

Since then, the FPS Symposium has been held annually, alternating
Canadian and French locations. After the previous meetings took place
in Grenoble, Toronto, Paris, Montr=C3=A9al, La Rochelle, Montr=C3=A9al,
Clermont-Ferrand, Quebec City, Nancy, Montr=C3=A9al, Toulouse, Montr=C3=
=A9al and
Paris, this 15th edition of the FPS symposium will be held in Ottawa,
Canada.

Protecting the communication and data infrastructure of an
increasingly inter-connected world has become vital to the normal
functioning of all aspects of our world. Security has emerged as an
important scientific discipline whose many multifaceted complexities
deserve the attention and synergy of the mathematical, computer
science, and engineering communities.

The aim of FPS is to discuss and exchange theoretical and practical
ideas that address privacy and security issues in inter-connected
systems. It aims to provide scientific presentations as well as to
establish links, promote scientific collaborations, joint research
programs, and student exchanges between institutions involved in this
important and fast-moving research field.

We welcome submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and
applied work including user research, methods, tools, simulations,
demos, and practical evaluations. Submissions should be 16 pages for
full technical papers and 8 pages for short, position papers or demos
including references. We also invite papers from researchers and
practitioners working in security, privacy, trustworthy data systems,
and related areas to submit their original papers. Moreover we are
interested in data sharing, data disclosure, individual tracking, and
fake news regarding their impacts on security and privacy.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Papers must be written in English and
must be submitted electronically in PDF format.

The papers that will be selected for presentation at the conference

the papers should be revised according to the review comments).
Pre-proceedings will appear at the time of the conference.

Maximum paper length will be 16 printed pages for full papers and 8
pages for short, position papers or demos in LNCS style
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).

Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be
presented at the conference.

All paper submissions will be handled through the Easy Chair
conference management system:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfps2022.
