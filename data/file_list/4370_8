NetSci 2020 Computer Science Track - Call for papers

This year, NetSci 2020 will feature a track on Computer Science
(https://netsci2020.netscisociety.net/calls-papers/) which is
dedicated to original unpublished works in the areas of network
models, algorithms, and applications. We welcome papers on algorithmic
and application topics related to networks and graph mining. Accepted
papers will be published in a major Computer Science Proceeding
series.

Topics include but are not limited to:

* Networks Analysis
* Social Recommender Systems
* Fairness, Trustworthiness and Transparency in Social Media
* Influence, viral marketing and information propagation
* Sampling, experiments, and evaluation in social networks
* User activity modelling and exploitation
* Interpretable models of individual and social behaviour
* Network models and algorithms
* Large-scale graph analysis
* Deep learning and graph embeddings
* Centrality, Community detection and Link prediction
* Probabilistic, temporal and spatial networks
* Multilayer networks

We also welcome submissions from biological, ecological and financial
networks to study collective and individual behaviours of new
phenomena.

Important Dates:
Deadline for submission: March 6, 2020 (23:59 CET)
Notification to authors: April 20, 2020

Submission format:
Submissions must represent new and original work. Concurrent
submissions, that is, papers under review to other conferences or
journals, are not allowed. However, submissions that are available
online or have been previously presented orally or as posters with no
formal proceedings, are allowed.
The Computer Science track accepts two types of submissions, regular
papers and posters. During submission you will be asked to indicate
your preference for one of these options.

Papers
Papers must be submitted in PDF in A4 or letter paper format using
11pt fonts, at least 1inch margins. Submissions should not exceed 12
pages including any diagrams or appendices, plus up to 3 additional
pages of references.
The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions
must be self-contained and in English. After uploading your
submission, please verify the copy stored on the submission site
properly. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines, or do not
view or print properly, may be rejected without review. Upon request
of the authors, the paper can be considered for oral/poster
presentation if not accepted for full paper publication in
proceedings.

Posters
Posters must be submitted in PDF in A4 or letter paper format using
11pt fonts, at least 1inch margins. Submissions should not exceed 5
pages including any diagrams or appendices, plus up to 1 additional
page of references.
The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions
must be self-contained and in English.

Review Process
Each paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members. The
acceptance decisions will take into account paper novelty, technical
depth, elegance, practical or theoretical impact, and presentation.

Reproducibility
The algorithms, resources and methods used within a paper should be
described as completely as possible. Authors may reference
supplementary material, including detailed descriptions, test datasets
or code. However, this information is not part of the submission
proper, and will be read only at the discretion of the reviewers.
Wherever appropriate, the authors are encouraged to use publicly
available test collections and state-of-the-art baselines. Please
consider sharing your intermediate/final experimental results and code
with the research community.

Publication and Presentation
We are currently in the process of negotiating publication with some
of the most relevant publishers in the field.
