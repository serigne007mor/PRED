CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS


Call for Tutorials

The 2009 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and
Data Mining (KDD'09)

June 28 - Jult 1st, 2009. Paris, France.

http://www.kdd.org/kdd2009/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

KDD'09 will host tutorials covering topics in data mining of interest to
the research community as well as application developers. The tutorials
will be part of the main conference technical program, and are free of
charge to the attendees of the conference.

We invite proposals for half-day tutorials from active researchers and
experienced tutors. Ideally, a tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art
research, development and applications in a specific data mining
direction, and stimulate and facilitate future work. Tutorials on
interdisciplinary directions, novel and fast growing directions, and
significant applications are highly encouraged. Accepted tutorials will
receive one free registration to the conference and an honorarium of $500.

A tutorial proposal should be formatted in the following sections.

1. Title

2. Abstract (up to 150 words)

3. Target audience and prerequisites. Proposals must clearly identify the
intended audience for the tutorial (e.g., novice users of statistical
techniques, or expert researchers in text mining). What background will be
required of the audience? Why is this topic important/interesting to the
KDD community? What is the benefit to participants?

4. Outline of the tutorial. Enough material should be included to provide
a sense of both the scope of material to be covered and the depth to which
it will be covered. The more details that can be provided, the better (up
to and including links to the actual slides). Note that the tutors should
NOT focus mainly on their own research results. A KDD tutorial is not a
forum for promoting one's research or product.

5. A list of forums and their time and locations if the tutorial or a
similar/highly related tutorial has been presented by the same author(s)
before, and highlight the similarity/difference between those and the one
proposed for KDD'08 (up to 100 words for each entry)

6. A list of tutorials on the same/similar/highly related topics given by
other people, and highlight the difference between yours and theirs (up to
100 words for each entry)

7. A list of other tutorials given by the authors, please list the titles,
the presenters and the forums only.

8. Tutors' short bio and their expertise related to the tutorial (up to
200 words per tutor)

9. A list of up to 20 most important references that will be covered in
the tutorial

10. (Optional) URLs of the slides/notes of the previous tutorials given by
the authors, and any specific audio/video/computerrequirements for the
tutorial.

Important dates for the tutorials:

• Proposals due: March 15

• Notification of Acceptance: May 25

Please send your submission to bart.goethals@ua.ac.be
