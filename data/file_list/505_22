CALL FOR PAPER

There is a growing interest in learning data topology, 
from theoretical results to real-world applications. 
Topological learning is an emerging field which is expected to 
bring new insights in all the areas of the data 
mining and knowledge discovery process. 

Data mining and knowledge discovery (KDD), 
as stated in their early definition, can today 
be considered as stable fields with numerous efficient 
methods and studies that have been proposed to extract 
knowledge from data. In every data mining task, 
understanding the structure of multidimensional patterns, 
in supervised or unsupervised cases, is of fundamental importance. 
Topological learning aims at finding hidden structures (usually low-dimensional manifolds) 
in order to better understand and exploit data.

The aim of this workshop is to address 
issues related to the concepts of learning 
data topology. Our goal is to attract papers dealing with 
each step of this field. Actually, learning data topology 
within the KDD process implies to work on every step, 
starting from the pre-processing (e.g. structuring and 
organizing) to the visualization and interpretation of 
the results, via the data mining methods themselves. 

There are still big practical and 
theoretical challenges dealing with data topology, among 
which: how to deal with noisy, high-dimensional, 
multi-scale or complex data (times series, images, 
graphs, trees, texts, etc.)? How to interpret and qualify the results? 
How to select the models complexity? How to design efficient algorithms with theoretical 
guarantees? When is topological learning beneficial against usual methods? Etc. Papers dealing with these 
issues and reporting applications on real data will be of fundamental interest for 
this emerging field, and will take high priority for the selection process. 
KDD fields which involve topological learning, include, but are not limited to:

	- Topology learning
	- Manifold learning
	- Spectral clustering and embedding
	- Spectral feature selection
	- Linear and non linear dimensionality reduction
	- Computational topology
	- Mathematical morphology
	- Geometric Inference
	- Topological learning and complex data
	- Applications and experience feedback
 
More and more people approach the field of topological learning from different and 
interesting angles. They come from various communities such as data mining, statistics, 
geometry, topology, physics, medicine or engineering. We believe that now is the 
right time to establish and enhance cross fertilization between these communities. 
During this workshop, researchers will have the opportunity to bring new ideas, 
discuss their experiences and contribute to the theoretical and practical maturation of topological learning. 

The workshop will consist in a series of communications (oral presentations or poster). 
A reasonable time will be left for the discussion after each presentation. 
All the articles will be reviewed at least twice with a goal to 
improve their quality and give advice to the authors. A dedicated place will 
be given to the young researchers with a session (Position paper) grouping 
the work in progress in the various European teams. That can be the occasion 
for a PhD student or a young researcher to present his/her starting project. 
This session will be particularly significant for work on the beginning and the 
installation of research groups on shared topics. Demonstrations of research 
results could be associated with the poster presentations.

INTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS 

The submissions should be written in English and should not exceed 10 pages in the Springer Verlag format.

Submitted papers will be evaluated by at least three reviewers. 
Any submission that exceeds length limits or 
deviates from formatting requirements may be rejected without review.
