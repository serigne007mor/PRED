============== COMPUTER SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM IN AUSTECH 2015 | Call for 
Papers ===============

The Computer Science Symposium (CSS) is a platform to explore and 
facilitate dissemination of the most recent advancements
in the theories, technologies and applications of computational systems 
for development (with special emphasis on Sub-Saharan Africa).

Computational systems are a dominating part of daily lives and a 
required support for most of the Engineering sciences.
High Performance clusters, Big data, Databases and information systems, 
integrated and embedded hardware/software components,
smart devices, mobile and pervasive networks, cyber physical systems and 
other computing technologies are seeing explosive growth of services to 
all user domains worldwide;
public or private, military or government, educational or industry, 
healthcare or finance, science or entertainment.

Theoretical, methodological, technical, scaling (i.e., bridging the gap 
between research and application) and many other important issues need
be studied, monitored, and predicted to the use of these technologies 
for development; a way to save costs, time, and/or lives and to add 
value to social capital.

The symposium will bring together researchers, experts, educators, 
developers, managers, entrepreneurs, students, professionals in Industry 
and government
to publish and share original findings, innovations, success stories, 
and challenges faced in the pursuit of advancing the focused 
technologies with their peers in a forum dedicated to this field.

PROGRAM TOPICS

The symposium is organized in 5 specific computational paradigms-focused 
workshops and a PhD colloquium:

=== Scientific Computing ===
•    Modeling & Simulation
•    Scientific tools
•    Operations Research
•    Numerical methods

=== Pervasive Computing ===
•    Web/Mobile applications
•    Smart/Wireless devices & networks
•    Embedded systems
•    Cyber physical systems

=== Massive Computing ===
•    Big Data
•    High Performance Clusters
•    Cloud computing

=== Graphics Computing ===
•    Games
•    Virtual/Augmented reality
•    Vision

=== Domain-specific Computing ===
Healthcare, Security, Education, Entertainment, Telecom, Industry…

=== PhD Colloquium ===
All computing paradigms: theory, methodology, technologies, tools and 
applications

You are invited to submit a position paper (12-15 pages) to one or more 
workshops.
All position papers are reviewed, and the authors invited to give 
presentations in the corresponding workshops.
The best position papers will be published in the “Theories, 
Technologies and Applications of Computational Systems for Development” 
book.
The others will appear in the conference Proceedings and their authors 
will be invited to submit a version to a special issue of an 
International Journal.

You are also invited to submit an extended abstract (2-4 pages) to the 
PhD colloquium.
An extended abstract can describe a summary of a thesis recently 
defended by a post graduate student, or a work in progress paper 
presented by a PhD student.
All extended abstracts will be reviewed and published in the Proceedings 
of the conference, and the authors will be invited to prepare a poster.
One or more sessions will be organized to allow authors present their 
posters.
Authors of the best extended abstracts will be invited to give a 
presentation in one of the workshops and to prepare a full paper to be 
submitted to a special issue of an International Journal as well.

Contributions are expected in:
--- Theory and methodology ---
     Specification languages for computational systems
     Verification, validation, testing and quality assurance of 
computational systems
     Advanced features including cooperation, intelligence, 
interoperability, and social and cultural aspects.
--- Technology, tools, toolkits and environments ---
     Engineering technologies for computational systems
     Advanced and integrated infrastructures for computational systems.
--- Applications ---
     Application of computational systems in various development sectors.
     Innovations in Computational systems for development.
