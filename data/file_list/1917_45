23rd International Workshop on Design, Optimization, Languages and =
Analytical Processing of Big Data - DOLAP 2021=20
Website: https://sites.google.com/view/dolap-2021/=20

Held in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Extending =
Database Technology and the 24th International Conference on Database =
Theory - EDBT/ICDT 2021
Website: https://edbticdt2021.cs.ucy.ac.cy=20

Announcements=20
--------------------=20
The best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a special issue of =
Information Systems.=20
A Best Paper Award will be presented to the authors written the best =
paper according to the Program Committee reviews.
A session will be devoted to Data Exploration and their impact on novel =
Big Data Management and Analytics approaches.=20

Call for Papers=20
--------------------=20
Nowadays, due to the advent of Big Data, Decision Support Systems (DSS) =
embrace a wider range of systems, in which novel solutions combining =
advanced data management and data analytics, (semi-)automating the data =
lifecycle (from ingestion to visualization). Yet, the DSS principles =
remain the same: these systems acknowledge the relevance to manage data =
in an efficient way (by means of data modeling and optimized data =
processing) to serve innovative data analysis bringing added value to =
organizations. The trend is to move from current systems that are "data =
presenting" to more dynamic systems that allow the semi-automation of =
the decision making process. This means that systems partially guide =
their users towards data discovery, management and system-aided decision =
making via intelligent techniques and visualization. In the back stage, =
the advent of the big data era, requires that new methods, models, =
techniques and architectures are developed to cope with the increasing =
demand in capacity, data type diversity, schema and data variability and =
responsiveness.

Special Theme: Data Exploration=20

Additional research topics include, but are not limited to:
Design and Language
Data management fundamentals: architectures, design, ETL/ELT, modeling, =
data integration, database design for big data, query processing, =
maintenance, evolution, security, personalization and privacy in =
decision support systems.
Data Variety: unstructured data (e.g., text), semi-structured data =
(e.g., XML), multimedia, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal data, =
stream and sensor data, semantic Web & deep Web, data lakes, data =
spaces, data quality, graph data.
Optimization
Coping with Volume: physical organization, performance optimization and =
tuning, scalability, MapReduce and Spark for data analytics, performance =
optimization of ETL/ELT.
Coping with Velocity: Deployment on parallel machine, database clusters, =
cloud infrastructures, smart grid, active/real-time analytics, real-time =
queries.
Analytical Processing and Applications
Analytics and Value: OLAP, data exploration through visualization, =
recommendation, reformulation, approximate query-answering, =
personalization, result presentation, data storytelling, graph =
analytics, process mining, advanced visualization for business contexts.=20=

Analytics and Veracity: heterogeneous data integration for analytics, =
quality aspects of data analysis, exploration outcome and end-user =
experience, fairness of data analysis, analytics and data driven =
decision making for the data enthusiasts.
Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, information =
retrieval, search engines, predictive and prescriptive analytics.
Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, smart energy.

DOLAP accepts long (10 pages) and short (5 pages) paper submissions in =
ACM format (please use this template: =
http://www.essi.upc.edu/dtim/DOLAP/files/acmart-edbt2020.cls). Long =
papers include novel and mature research, industrial or survey work. =
Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might be accepted to =
the workshop as short papers. Short papers include:
On-going: novel research works with preliminary results.
Vision: position papers outlining research issues for future work.
DOLAP includes a second review round for uncertain cases where either =
there is no agreement among the reviewers, or they ask for a =
clarification prior to accepting the paper.

The proceedings of the workshop will be published online as a volume of =
the CEUR Workshop Proceedings.
