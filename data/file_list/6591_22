Call for Papers
===============

The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Network
Analysis and Mining (ASONAM) provides a premier interdisciplinary
forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from all social
networking analysis and mining related fields for presentation of
original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of
innovative, practical development experiences. ASONAM 2014 seeks to
address important challenging problems with a specific focus on the
emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking
analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and
theoretical findings along with their real-world applications.

General areas of interest to ASONAM 2014 include the design, analysis
and implementation of social networking theory, systems and
applications from information science, mathematics, communications,
business administration, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied
linguistics, biology and medicine. More specialized topics within
ASONAM include, but are not limited to:

  * Agent based social simulation and computational models
  * Anomaly detection in social network evolution
  * Application of social network analysis and mining
  * Community discovery and analysis in large scale online/offline
    social networks
  * Connection between biological similarities and social network
    formulation
  * Contextual social network analysis and mining
  * Crime network analysis
  * Crowd sourcing
  * Cyber anthropology
  * Dark Web
  * Data models for social networks and social media
  * Data protection inside communities
  * Economical impact of social network discovery
  * Evolution of communities/patterns on the Web and in large organizations
  * Impact of social networks on recommendations systems
  * Incorporating social information in query processing and query
    optimization

Paper Submissions
*****************

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining
to the above topics are solicited. The papers will reviewed by a
minimum of two subject experts. Full paper manuscripts must be in
English with a maximum length of 8 pages using the IEEE CPS two-column
template. Papers should be submitted to the Conference Web site:
https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2014/asonam14/cbc_index.php. IEEE will
retain the copyright for accepted papers and the IEEE copyright form
found at
http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/copyrightmain.html
will therefore have to be completed. Papers will be accepted for the
conference based on the reviewers comments on their originality,
timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. If
the paper is accepted, the paper will appear in the proceedings of the
conference if one author presents the paper at the conference and at
least one author register as a full conference participant.

Publications
************

Accepted and presented papers will be included in the ASONAM 2014
Conference Proceedings and forwarded for inclusion in IEEE Computer
Society Digital Library (CSDL), IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital
Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for EI indexing
through INSPEC by the IEEE.
