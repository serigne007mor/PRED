Subject: [liste-egc] 20th anniversary of KDID (knowledge discovery in
 inductive databases) Workshop @ECML/PKDD 2022

KDID2022:  20th anniversary of KDID Workshop

23 September 2022

KEY DATES
Paper submission deadline: June 20, 2022
Paper acceptance notification: July 13, 2022
Paper camera-ready deadline: July 26, 2022
Workshop date: September 23, 2022

CONTEXT
During the 20 years since the first international workshop on knowledge dis=
covery in inductive databases (co-located with ECML/PKDD 2002 in Helsinki),=
 the inductive discovery of knowledge from data has been enriched with new =
concepts and methods. By leaving more room for interaction with the user, o=
r on the contrary by being more automatic (less dependent on the arbitrarin=
ess of values that are difficult to set), pattern mining has explored diffe=
rent directions, both principled and applied. The workshop will cover all t=
he areas that were born, more or less, from the concept of inductive databa=
ses, a term little used today but whose concepts are nevertheless very frui=
tful.
The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practition=
ers of data mining and machine learning interested in principle-based metho=
ds for data analysis. We welcome submissions focusing on recent advances an=
d latest developments in this area of research. Submissions describing prel=
iminary, promising studies and recently accepted papers are also welcome.

TOPICS:
=E2=80=93 Foundations on pattern mining, pattern usage, and pattern underst=
anding
=E2=80=93 Pattern mining for Data Science
=E2=80=93 Interpretable Data Mining
=E2=80=93 Subgroup discovery
=E2=80=93 Incorporating domain knowledge into pattern mining
=E2=80=93 Interactive pattern mining
=E2=80=93 Mining stream, time-series and sequence data
=E2=80=93 Mining networks and graphs=20


SUBMISSION
We welcome original contributions, either theoretical or empirical, describ=
ing ongoing projects or completed work. Contributions can be of two types: =
either short position papers (up to 6 pages including references) or full r=
esearch papers (up to 16 pages including references). Papers must be writte=
n in LNCS format, i.e., accordingly to the ECML-PKDD 2022 submission format=
. Accepted contributions will be made available electronically through the =
Workshop web page. Post-proceedings will be also published on the CEUR-WS p=
latform.
