Deadline Extension (January 20th) and Final Call for Papers
GRAPHOLINGUISTICS IN THE 21ST CENTURY=E2=80=94FROM GRAPHEMES TO =
KNOWLEDGE
Palaiseau, France, June 8-10, 2022
<https://grafematik2022.sciencesconf.org>
*****************************************************************
G21C (Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century, also called /g=CA=81afematik/=
)
is a biennial conference bringing together disciplines concerned with
grapholinguistics and more generally the study of writing systems and
their representation in written communication. The conference aims to
reflect on the current state of research in the area, and on the role
that writing and writing systems play in neighboring disciplines like
computer science and information technology, communication, typography,
psychology, and pedagogy. In particular it aims to study the effect of
the growing importance of Unicode with regard to the future of reading
and writing in human societies. Reflecting the richness of perspectives
on writing systems, G21C is actively interdisciplinary, and welcomes
proposals from researchers from the fields of computer science and
information technology, linguistics, communication, pedagogy,
psychology, history, and the social sciences.

G21C aims to create a space for the discussion of the range of
approaches to writing systems, and specifically to bridge approaches in
linguistics, informatics, and other fields. It will provide a forum for
explorations in terminology, methodology, and theoretical approaches
relating to the delineation of an emerging interdisciplinary area of
research that intersects with intense activity in practical
implementations of writing systems.

The Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century Conference is kindly endorsed
by ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and by ATypI
(Association Typographique Internationale).

The first edition of G21C was held in Brest, France, on June 14-15, 2018
and the second edition was held online on June 17-19, 2020. It is
sponsorized by the LabSTICC CNRS laboratory (UMR 6285)
