2nd International Workshop on Education through Advanced Software 
Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (EASEAI)
Co-located with ESEC/FSE '20 in Sacramento, California, United States.
On November 9, 2020.
Website: https://easeai.github.io

** DESCRIPTION **

In the past years, with the development and widespread of digital 
technologies, everyday life has been profoundly transformed. The general 
public, as well as specialized audiences, have to face an 
ever-increasing amount of knowledge and learn new abilities. The EASEAI 
workshop addresses that challenge by looking at software engineering, 
education, and artificial intelligence research fields to explore how 
they can be combined. Specifically, this workshop brings together 
researchers, teachers, and practitioners who use advanced software 
engineering tools and artificial intelligence techniques in the 
education field and through a transgenerational and transdisciplinary 
range of students to discuss the current state of the art and practices, 
and establish new future directions.

** TOPICS OF INTEREST **

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- New and unexpected usage of established software engineering practices 
in education environments.
- Integration of agile methods principles in education environments.
- Integration of software quality standards and methods dedicated to 
continuous improvement in education environments.
- Application to serious game and gamification in the context of education.
- Advances in automated grading of assignments.
- Advances in automated feedback and recommendations to provide support 
to students.
- Visualization of technical and/or scientific information in various 
fields (chemistry, software engineering, physics, history, sociology, 
etc.).
- Efforts related to the improvement of the usability of advanced tools 
for non-experienced users.
- Dropout prediction in learning environments using machine learning.
- Feedback on case studies using cutting edge techniques, methods, and 
tools applied to educational environments.
- Improvement of computational thinking skills and digital literacy 
through software engineering.
- Integration of software engineering and artificial intelligence 
research into teaching and training.
- Introduction to artificial intelligence and machine learning 
principles for younger audiences.

** TYPES OF SUBMISSIONS **

We invite original papers in the conference format (two columns ACM 
sigconf publication format) describing positions and new ideas, as well 
as new results and reporting on innovative approaches (up to 6 pages). 
All accepted papers will be published in the ACM digital library, 
together with the other ESEC/FSE 2020 workshops proceedings. The review 
process is single-blind. Each contribution will be reviewed by at least 
three members of the program committee.

The workshop also welcomes presentations of previously peer-reviewed 
published papers. We will invite authors to submit a one-page extended 
abstract that will not be included in the proceedings. As previously 
published papers have been already reviewed and accepted, they will not 
be reviewed again for technical content. If needed, the presentation 
propositions will be prioritized, based on the content and structure of 
the sessions.

** IMPORTANT DATES **

Submission of full papers: July 8th, 2020
Notification of acceptance: August 26th, 2020
Camera-ready: September 18th, 2020
Workshop date: November 9th, 2020
Submission: see https://easeai.github.io/#call

** WORKSHOP CHAIRS **

Benoît Vanderose, PReCISE, University of Namur (Belgium)
Julie Henry, PReCISE, University of Namur (Belgium)
Benoît Frénay, PReCISE, University of Namur (Belgium)
Xavier Devroey, Delft University of Technology (Netherlands)
