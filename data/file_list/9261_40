Creating activities to enhance identification, preservation, and use=20=20
of this knowledge is a powerful mean to improve the level of=20=20
economical performance of the organization. Thus, companies invest on=20=20
knowledge management programs, in order to develop a knowledge sharing=20=
=20
and collaboration culture, to amplify individual and organizational=20=20
learning, to make easier accessing and transferring knowledge, and to=20=20
insure knowledge preservation.  Several researches can be considered=20=20
