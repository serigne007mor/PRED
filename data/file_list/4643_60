AIMLAI@CIKM2020: International Workshop on Advances in Interpretable 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Website: https://project.inria.fr/aimlai/
Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aimlaicikm20
Submission deadline: July 22th, 2020

** Description **

The purpose of AIMLAI (Advances in Interpretable Machine Learning and 
Artificial Intelligence) is to encourage principled research leading to 
the advancement of explainable, transparent, ethical and fair data 
mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. AIMLAI is a 
workshop that seeks top-quality submissions addressing uncovered 
important issues related to explainable and interpretable data mining 
and machine learning models. Papers should present research results in 
any of the topics of interest for the workshop as well as application 
experiences, tools and promising preliminary ideas. AIMLAI asks for 
contributions from researchers, in academia or industry, working on 
topics addressing these challenges primarily from a technical point of 
view, but also from a legal, ethical or sociological perspective. 
Besides the central topic of interpretable algorithms and explanation 
methods, we also welcome submissions that answer the following two 
research questions: (i) "how to measure and evaluate interpretability 
and explainability?" and (ii) "how to integrate humans in the machine 
learning pipeline for interpretability purposes?".

** Topics **

     Interpretable ML
         Supervised ML (classifiers, regressors, …)
         Unsupervised ML (clustering, dimensionality reduction, 
visualisation, …)
         Explaining recommendation systems
     Transparency in AI and ML
         Ethical aspects
         Legal aspects
         Fairness issues
     Methodology and formalization of interpretability
         Formal measures of interpretability
         Interpretability/complexity trade-offs
         How to evaluate interpretability
     User-centric interpretability
         Interpretability modules: generating explanations for ML and AI 
algorithms
         Semantic interpretability: how to add semantics to explanations
         Human-in-the-loop to construct and/or evaluate interpretable models
         Integration of ML algorithms, infovis and man-machine interfaces


** Submission Guidelines **

Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the ACM 
proceedings format. Overlength papers will be rejected without review 
(papers with smaller page margins and font sizes than specified in the 
author instructions and set in the style files will also be treated as 
overlength).

Authors who submit their work to AIMLAI 2020 commit themselves to 
present their paper at the workshop in case of acceptance. AIMLAI 2020 
considers the author list submitted with the paper as final. No 
additions or deletions to this list may be made after paper submission, 
either during the review period, or in case of acceptance, at the final 
camera ready stage.

Condition for inclusion in the post-proceedings is that at least one of 
the co-authors has presented the paper at the workshop. Pre-proceedings 
will be available online before the workshop.  All papers for AIMLAI 
2020 must be submitted to the on-line submission system at 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aimlaicikm20.


** Program Chairs **

- Adrien Bibal, University of Namur, Belgium
- Tassadit Bouadi, University of Rennes/IRISA, France
- Benoît Frénay, University of Namur, Belgium
- Luis Galárraga, Inria/IRISA, France
- José Oramas, University of Antwerp, Belgium


** Venue **

The conference will be co-located with the conference CIKM, which will 
be held online on October 19th-23rd, 2020. The exact date of the 
workshop has not yet been defined, but it will take place on either 
October 19th or 20th.


** Publication **

All accepted papers will be published as post-proceedings and included 
in a CIKM companion volume published by http://ceur-ws.org/.


** Contact **

All questions about submissions should be emailed to 
aimlaicikm20@easychair.org.
