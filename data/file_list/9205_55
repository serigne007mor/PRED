*Call for participation *

*One-day Workshop on Emerging Trends in Clustering*
                     Centre Universitaire de Recherche
                             Hotel Dupanloup - Orléans
                                 June 12th 2015

                 https://sites.google.com/site/etclustering/

*The registration is free, but mandatory for organization reasons. It 
will be open until May 29th. Please register as soon as possible. The 
workshop venue is close to many restaurants.*

*For those interested in making an oral presentation, the deadline for 
submission is May 29th*.

Clustering techniques are essential for knowledge discovery in many 
applications. This one day workshop aims at providing an overview on 
some emerging trends within the research area of clustering including 
declarative formulations, multi-objective, multi-view and 
constraint-based clustering.

The main objectives are to:  1) further increase interest on such 
important topics in the wider research community; and 2) provide a forum 
for researchers to present and discuss research results and 
state-of-the-art ongoing work.


Plenary Speakers:
* *Ian Davidson - Department of Computer Science, University of 
California/Davis, USA*
Title: Declarative Formulations for Machine Learning and Data Mining

* *Julien Velcin - ERIC, Université Lyon 2*
Title: Structuring temporal sparse data with application to opinion 
mining in the social media.

**Marcilio de Souto and Guillaume Cleuziou - LIFO, Université d'Orléans*
Title: Discovering multiple clusterings


In order to allow fruitful discussions, besides the plenary talks, 
during the Workshop, we invite submissions describing recently completed 
work, highly relevant results of research in progress, or successful 
systems and applications. The works will be presented in oral sessions 
(one or two). Since they will not be formal publications, they are 
eligible for future publication in other venues.

Submissions must be in English and must include a 2-page abstract and a 
short CV of the authors in PDF format. They must be sent to 
christel.vrain<at>univ-orleans.fr

In addition to the quality of the work, the submissions received will be 
selected taking into account that they meet the topics of the Workshop.
