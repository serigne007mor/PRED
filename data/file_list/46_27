The IFIP TC8/WG8.3 conferences present the latest innovations and
achievements of academic communities on Decision Support Systems (DSS).
These advances include theory, systems, computer aided methods, algorithms,
techniques, and applications related to supporting decision making.

This conference is supported by the Euro Working Group on DSS (see
http://www.euro-online.org/).

The main theme for the 2008 edition of the conference is Collaborative
Decision Making and in particular, addressing the question of how to support
Collaboration in Decision Making? Welcome answers will incorporate key
elements to deal with the complexity of supporting collaborative decision
making. Expected contributions will try to answer to some of the following
questions:
Where does the data for collaborative decision making come from and how is
it assembled?
Who is, or should be, involved in making the decision?
How do teams collaborate to build up common understanding?
How to Tackle Complexity in decision making and decision support?
A special focus on Data, Models and Actors will be taken into account.

Topics: The topics of interest for the conference include, but are not
limited to:
- Facilitation of team coordination and data collection and exchange
- Logistics knowledge collaboration model
- Impact of introducing new technology on collaboration
- Spontaneous collaborations
- Evaluation of the most appropriate collaboration level
- Coordination of distributed supply chain partnerships
- Machine intelligence coupled with human intelligence
- Collaboration across supply networks using intelligent agents
- Knowledge-intensive collaborative design
- On-demand business process-based collaboration
- Utilizing context in knowledge management and collaborative systems
- Collaboration among entities in a network such as schedulers
- Social collaboration systems
- Intellectual capital as a resource network for collaborative decision
making.

Papers focused on other areas linked to DSS area are also welcome, for
example:
- Data-driven DSS (including data mining types of problems)
- Model-driven DSS
