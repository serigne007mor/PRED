The 2010 Workshop on Social Interactions Analysis and Services Providers (S=
IASP)
In conjunction with the IEEE ICDM 2010
December 13th, 2010, Sydney, Australia
http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/~siasp/


CALL FOR PAPERS


With the emergence of Web 2.0, the user became the heart of various technol=
ogies that compose this new era such as mashups, collaborative environments=
, social networks, etc. The main added ingredient is certainly the social d=
imension with the aim of linking users together to facilitate their interac=
tion and make it richer and more productive. The social Web is increasingly=
 becoming the most interesting part of the Web and is at the point of chall=
enging well established Web players such as the traditional search engines,=
 e.g., Google. This is a huge step forward from a user perspective but also=
 opens up great prospects for research in an environment that becomes incre=
asingly complex, less structured and more hostile considering the great mas=
s of knowledge generally hidden from the user.
Social networks are the focus of most of the work being done around the soc=
ial Web. Works in this area address in particular the structural properties=
, e.g., the strength of social connections, characterization of key players=
, etc. Apart from social networks, the social dimension may be found in oth=
er forms and other locations on the Web: social media such as YouTube and F=
lickr, social news like Digg or Twitter, or social bookmarking as Delicious=
 (del.icio.us). All these forms constitute a huge container of social infor=
mation with knowledge that may be useful to the user. This knowledge may be=
 leveraged by, e.g., offering new value added services exploiting that know=
ledge, which otherwise is very poorly exploited by users and service provid=
ers today.
This workshop aims to bring together researchers and young researchers from=
 both academia and industry around issues related to the social interaction=
s analysis through mining social data for providing users added value servi=
ces. On the other hand, it is necessary to study and understand how service=
s providers could leverage this huge mass of hidden knowledge for, e.g., bu=
siness purposes, an issue facing all services providers in this area. Concr=
etely, this includes confronting ideas in order to have a clearer view of t=
he elements that surround this new phenomenon, to build a clear overview of=
 advances in the various tracks related to the new Web era and then examini=
ng the scientific and industrial short, medium and long terms to rise aroun=
d this hot topic.
The workshop includes the following topics (but not limited to):
o       Knowledge discovery from social data;
o       Social networks (personal/professional) analysis;
o       Service providers and the social Web;
o       Applications of social knowledge;
o       Social analysis for content and services personalization;
o       Business models of the social Web;
o       Information retrieval and filtering in the social Web;
o       Community extraction and analysis;
o       Privacy in the social Web;
o       New challenges in social interactions analysis for services provide=
rs;
o       etc.

Submission must be written in English and should not exceed 10 pages using =
the IEEE format. All the submissions will be reviewed by at least three rev=
iewers. Authors should submit their articles electronically through the sub=
mission platform using the workshop website.
