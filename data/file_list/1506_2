                       The 10th International Workshop on 
                    Nature Inspired Distributed Computing 
                                  (NIDISC'07)

                           held in conjunction with
                     The 21th IEEE/ACM International 
   Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium  (IPDPS 2006)
                     26th March - Friday, 30th March 2007
                        Renaissance Long Beach Hotel
                        Long Beach, California, USA

**********************************************************************

Workshop Theme :
=============

Techniques based on metaheuristics and nature-inspired paradigms can
provide efficient solutions to a wide variety of problems. Moreover,
parallel and distributed metaheuristics can be used to provide more
powerful problem solving environments in a variety of fields, ranging,
for example, from finance to bio- and health-informatics. This
workshop seeks to provide an opportunity for researchers to explore
the connection between metaheuristics and the development of solutions
to problems that arise in operations research, parallel computing,
telecommunications, bioinformativs, and many others. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Nature-inspired methods (e.g. ant colonies, GAs, cellular automata,
DNA and molecular computing, local search, etc) for problem solving
environments.
* Parallel and distributed metaheuristics techniques (algorithms,
technologies and tools).
* Applications combining traditional parallel and distributed
computing and optimization techniques as well as theoretical issues
(convergence, complexity, etc).
* Other algorithms and applications relating the above mentioned
research areas.

Prospective authors of high quality research contributions are invited
to submit an electronic copy of their manuscript not exceeding 8
two-column pages including figures and references in the traditional
IEEE format used in IPDPS. Please, use Postscript or PDF when
possible. In your email, please indicate paper title, author(s), and
the corresponding author.

A selected group of authors from the workshop will be invited to
submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of an
international scholarly journal. Further announcements will be made
during the workshop.
