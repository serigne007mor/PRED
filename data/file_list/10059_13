CFP ASONAM 2012:  Istanbul Turkey 26-29 August 2012

March 15, 2012 : Full paper submission deadline

Proceedings will be published by the prestigious IEEE CS -- CPS.

The study of social networks originated in social and business
communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced
significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social
Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the
online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging
systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning
techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that
fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge,
group activities, community formation and evolution.
This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics,
homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities
of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are
increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.

The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and
Mining (ASONAM 2012) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue
that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of
SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas
and practices. ASONAM 2012 is intended to address important aspects with a
specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with
social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits
experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining
along with their application to real life situations.

General areas of interest to ASONAM 2012 include information science and
mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational studies,
sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology and
medicine.

More specialized topics within ASONAM include, but are not limited to:

   * Adoption of new services on social network platforms
   * Agent based social simulation, agent based computational models
   * Anomaly detection in social network evolution
   * Application of social network analysis
   * Application of social network mining
   * Communities discovery and analysis in large scale online social networks
   * Communities discovery and analysis in large scale offline social
networks
   * Connection between biological similarities and social network
formulation

    August 26-29, 2012 : Conference

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining to
the above topics are solicited (Proceeding indexed by EI). Full paper
submission deadline is March 15, 2012. These papers will follow an
academic review process. Full paper manuscripts must be in English with a
maximum length of 8 pages (using the IEEE two-column template).
Submissions should include the title, author(s), affiliation(s), e-mail
address(es), tel/fax numbers, abstract, and postal address(es) on the
first page. Papers should be submitted to the Conference Website:
asonam2012.etu.edu.tr. If Web submission is not possible, manuscripts
should be sent as an attachment via email to ozyer@etu.edu.tr by March 15,
2012. The attachment must be in PDF or Word .doc format.

Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness,
significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Authors should
certify that their papers represent substantially new previously
unpublished work. Paper submission implies that the intent is for one
of the authors to present the paper if accepted and that at least one of
the authors register for a full conference fee.
