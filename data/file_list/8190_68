Call for papers
CWC 2013: 2nd Workshop on Cooking with Computers
3 August 2013 - Beijing, China
Held during IJCAI 2013
http://liris.cnrs.fr/cwc
**********************************************************************

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=3D Presentation

Can computers help cooking? Can "machine learning'" help cooking? Can
"knowledge representation" help cooking? Can "reasoning" help cooking? Can
"planning" help cooking?
Can "natural language processing" help cooking? Can any other field of AI
help cooking?

The Cooking with Computers workshop aims at gathering researchers from as
many fields of AI as possible. The main objective of this
workshop is to show how some existing AI approaches could be used to solve
problems in the cooking and eating domain.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=3D Submission topics

This workshop is widely open to all AI researchers, whatever their
sub-topic of research is. It is an opportunity for AI researchers to
examine their approaches on a
common application and a way to highlight some possible interactions
between AI fields.

Expected submissions include (but are not limited to):
* Machine learning (categorizing cooking elements, e.g. what is a soup?,
prediction of cooking times, ...).
* Classification (organizing recipes, organizing procedures, ...).
* Knowledge representation (representing recipes, cooking procedure, domain
knowledge, flavours and subjective informations, ...).
* Knowledge extraction (extracting cooking knowledge, building ontologies,
building inference mechanisms, ...).
* Natural language processing (extracting cooking knowledge from
unstructured natural language texts, ...).
* Reasoning (using inference mechanisms for adapting recipes, creating new
recipes, dealing with nutritional aspects, ...).
* Semantic Web (sharing cooking resources, ...).
* Sentiment Analysis (detecting cooking preferences, ...).
* Video annotation (identifying in a cooking video what is cooked, or the
sequence related to a given preparation, ...).
* Planning / workflows (improving the presentation of preparation steps to
users, ...).
* Human-Machine Interfaces (designing next generation cooking assistants,
...).

Application domains include (but are not limited to):
* Cooking assistants
* Recipes design
* Cooking and food sustainability
* Cooking for well-being
* Cooking and pedagogy
* Cooking for special regimes
* Interactive recipes visualisation
* Sharing of cooking knowledge
* Cooking and shopping
* Cooking and health
* Cooking and recommendation systems

=3D Submission format

We invite the following kinds of contributions:
* Full research or application papers (10 pages) describing recent research
outcomes, mature work, prototypes, applications, or methodologies.
* Short position papers (up to 6 pages) describing early work and new ideas
that are not yet fully worked out.
* Demo outlines (2 pages) describing the demonstration of a software
prototype in the poster and demo session during the workshop.
Demonstrations are widely open to any kind of contribution: cooking system,
innovative website, personal assistant application, video, cooking robots,
etc.
* Poster descriptions (2 pages) outlining a poster to be presented in the
poster and demo session during the workshop.

All submissions must be written in English, following IJCAI 2013
submissions guidelines.
