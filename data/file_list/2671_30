Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Workshop on Combination of Symbolic and
 Sub-symbolic Methods and their Applications (CSSA) @ ECML/PKDD

***************************************
Call for Papers

Workshop on Combination of Symbolic and Sub-symbolic Methods and their =
Applications (CSSA)
Co-located with ECML/PKDD 2021
=20
Web: https://alammehwish.github.io/cssa_cikm_2020/=20
Deadline: June 23rd, 2021
***************************************
Since the beginning of the 2000s, there has been an increasing number of =
studies and standards proposed for generating large-scale symbolic =
representations of knowledge (known as Knowledge Graphs (KGs)) out of =
heterogeneous resources such as text, images, etc. Moreover, there have =
been many advances in symbolic reasoning as well as their applications =
to various fields. Recently, sub-symbolic methods have gained momentum. =
These methods aim at generating distributed representations from several =
resources such as text or symbolic representations (Graph Neural =
Networks, KG embeddings, etc.). These sub-symbolic methods for symbolic =
representations mainly focus on the task of KG completion. However, =
these have also recently been used for various tasks such as Natural =
Language Processing (NLP). The future of these methods would be a =
combination of these approaches leading to neuro-symbolic reasoning. =
Advances in the real-world applications related to these methods will =
also serve as a stepping stone in the practicality of these methods.
