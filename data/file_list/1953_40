The increasing proliferation of Information and communication
technologies (ICT) in our lives, has facilitated the connectivity
growth between distinct parts of our world. Various types of data are
continuously streaming across many boundaries in the world with
different models, policies, and purposes. Additionally, this data is
usually analyzed or stored on edge or gateways devices which have
highly limited capabilities and are vulnerable to sophisticated
attacks. With the growth of connectivity between various heterogeneous
systems, numerous attack vectors are constantly evolving, that can
potentially be exploited for malicious or criminal purposes (e.g. data
breaches, identity theft, and stealing of intellectual property and
trade secrets, etc.). Recent cyberattacks dangerously aim a broad
array of computing systems varying from data centers and personal
machines to mobile devices and industrial control systems.

There is a growing need for new methodologies, tools, and techniques,
capable of extracting, preserving, and analyzing different evidence
trails in various networked services and devices such as routers,
firewalls, web proxies, and network monitoring tools. Additionally,
there is also a growing need for research in new systems that are
capable of analyzing network traffic, netflows, and systems logs.
Satisfying these demands will aid in reconstructing the timeline of
the cyber-crime/attack under investigation and, possibly, the
identification of the potential actor(s).

The evolution of networked technologies, such as the internet of
things and cyber-physical systems, possess challenges based on the
highly limited capabilities of their infrastructure devices and the
type of data that can be processed by these devices. Complicated
efforts are required in suitable and timely manners against any
detected threats. Moreover, new frameworks are required to collect and
preserve potential evidential data in suitable and timely manners as
well. To guarantee proper cyber-defenses and strategies against the
expanding landscape of criminal activities as well as rapidly
advancing network technologies such as SDN or 5G and 6G.

Papers on practical as well as on theoretical topics and problems in
various topics related to cyber forensics and threat investigations,
are invited, with special emphasis on novel techniques and tools to
collect data from networked devices and services in emerging networks
(such as the ones can be found in cyber-physical systems and Internet
of things). Topics include (but are not limited to):
