     The 25th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2010)
March 22 - 26, 2009, Ecole Polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL)
                       Sierre, Switzerland

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Track on ADVANCES IN SPATIAL AND IMAGE-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ASIIS 10)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/DBconf/ASIIS/

-- Description

Spatial and Image-based information systems are increasingly at the heart of
novel applications, raising new challenges in complex spatial data modeling,
spatial data and image sharing, emergent geo-spatial data semantics. ASIIS is a
track of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2009). For the past twenty
years the ACM SAC symposium has been a primary and international forum for
applied computer scientists, computer engineers and application developers
to interact and present their work. The ASIIS track aims to foster
interdisciplinary discussions and research in various aspects of spatial and
image based information systems.

The topics of interest should be related to spatial and image-based systems,
they include but are not limited to:

* Image-Content indexing and retrieval
* Geographical information systems
* Data modelling
* Multiple representations
* Spatial and spatiotemporal indexing
* Spatial and Image based metadata and ontologies
* Spatial reasoning and AI
* Languages for metadata management
* Novel and challenging applications
* Query processing and optimization
* Image databases
* Similarity search
* Interoperability and standards
* Traffic telematics
* Location-based services
* Visual query languages
* Semantic web and spatial data applications
* Ontologies for spatial information systems
* Grid computing for GIS distributed computing
* Intelligent User Interfaces



-- Submission guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original work, not previously published, and
currently not submitted elsewhere. The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must
NOT appear in the body of the paper,
and self-reference should be in the third person. This is to facilitate blind
review.
Only the title should be shown at the first page without the author's
information."
Authors should submit a full paper via electronic Submission. Each paper MUST BE
"Original, unpublished work"
and will undergo a formal peer review process on the basis of technical quality,
originality,
clarity, and relevance to the track topics above.

Accepted papers will be included in the SAC 10 conference proceedings published
by ACM. The final version of all accepted papers must be within 5 pages
prepared using ACM two-column format. One of the authors of each accepted paper
must attend the ACM SAC 10 symposium.

Papers should be submitted using the electronic submission system
(http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2010/).
Contact Richard CHBEIR if you encounter any problem when submitting.

Selected papers will be considered for possible publication in several journals.
