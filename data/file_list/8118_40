General=20

The first edition of the FCA4AI Workshop at ECAI 2012 in Montpellier=20
showed that many researchers working in Artificial Intelligence are=20
indeed interested by a powerful method for classification and mining=20
such as Formal Concept Analysis (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-939/). We have=20
the chance to organize a new edition of the workshop in Beijing at the=20
IJCAI 2013 Conference.=20

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory=20
aimed at data analysis and classification. FCA allows one to build a=20
concept lattice and a system of dependencies (implications) which can=20
be used for many AI needs, e.g. knowledge processing involving learning,=20
knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, ontology=20
engineering, and as well as information retrieval and text processing.=20
Thus, there exist many ``natural links'' between FCA and AI.=20

Recent years have been witnessing increased scientific activity around=20
FCA, in particular a strand of work emerged that is aimed at extending=20
the possibilities of FCA w.r.t. knowledge processing, such as work on=20
pattern structures and relational context analysis. These extensions=20
are aimed at allowing FCA to deal with more complex than just binary=20
data, both from the data analysis and knowledge discovery point of=20
view and from the knowledge representation point of view, including,=20
e.g., ontology engineering.=20
All these works extend the capabilities of FCA and offer new=20
possibilities for AI activities in the framework of FCA.=20

Accordingly, in this workshop, we will be interested in two main issues:=20

- How can FCA support AI activities such as knowledge processing (knowledge=
=20
discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning), learning (clustering,=
=20
pattern and data mining), natural language processing, information retrieva=
l.=20
- How can FCA be extended in order to help AI researchers to solve new=20
and complex problems in their domain.=20

The workshop is dedicated to discuss such issues.=20

INVITED SPEAKER=20
TBA=20

TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to:=20

- Concept lattices and related structures: description logics, pattern=20
structures, relational structures.=20
- Knowledge discovery and data mining with FCA: association rules,=20
itemsets and data dependencies, attribute implications, data=20
pre-processing, redundancy and dimensionality reduction,=20
classification and clustering.=20
- Knowledge engineering and ontology engineering: knowledge=20
representation and reasoning.=20
- Scalable algorithms for concept lattices and artificial intelligence=20
``in the large'' (distributed aspects, big data).=20
- Applications of concept lattices: semantic web, information=20
retrieval, visualization and navigation, pattern recognition.=20

The workshop will include time for audience discussion for having a=20
better understanding of the issues, challenges, and ideas being=20
presented.=20

IMPORTANT DATES:=20

Submission deadline: May 13, 2013 (**** extended until June 3rd ****)=20
Notification to authors: June 24, 2013=20
Final version: July 08, 2013=20
Workshop: August 03-05, 2013=20


SUBMISSION DETAILS:=20

The workshop welcomes submissions in pdf format in Springer's LNCS style.=
=20
Submissions can be=20
- technical papers not exceeding 8 pages,=20
- system descriptions or position papers on work in progress not=20
exceeding 4 pages=20

 for a special issue of a high-level journal.=20
