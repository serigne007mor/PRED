Author Notification: 8th March 2012

Workshop: 17th April 2012

=3D=3DGoal and Motivations=3D=3D

Semantic Web Collaborative Spaces such as semantic wikis, semantic
social networks, semantic forums, etc. are social semantic software
with the mission to bring together human agents and software agents in
order to foster knowledge-intensive collaboration, content creation
and management, annotated multimedia collection management, social
knowledge diffusion and formalising, and more generally speaking
ontology-oriented content management life-cycle.

The domain spans from multidisciplinary research to deployed
commercial web applications and contributions from all this spectrum
are encouraged. The aim of the SWCS 2012 workshop is to exchange
ideas, to discuss pressing research questions arising from theoretical
studies and practical usage of semantic web collaborative spaces.

=3D=3DTopics=3D=3D


Contributions to this workshop will address one or more of the
following topics:

Representing and reasoning on semantics in social web platforms:
  * reconciling formal semantics and social semantics
  * semantic social network analysis, community detection and community
building
  * analyses of semantic wiki contributors and their contributions
  * combining, transforming, translating formal and informal knowledge
  * coping with disagreement, inconsistencies
  * semantics in social/human computing, and vice versa
  * change management, truth maintenance, versioning, and undoing semantic
changes
  * connecting knowledge and social interaction
  * from asynchronous interactions to real-time/multi-synchronous
interactions in SWCS
  * optimising, distributing, scaling SWCS
  * managing and exploiting the emergence of models and their semantics

Interacting with and within SWCS:
  * browsing, navigating, visualizing
  * editing linked open data, schemas, rules, etc.
  * ergonomics of SWCS, interaction design and usability studies
  * object-centered sociality, knowledge-centered sociality
  * overcoming entrance barriers and giving incentives for contributing
  * provenance, traceability, permissions, trust, licensing, access
control, privacy,
  * making formal knowledge accessible, social knowledge evaluation
  * mobile and multimodal accesses to SWCS

Return on experience and applications of semantic web collaborative spaces:
  * swcs platforms in e-science,  e-learning, e-health, e-governement,
  * enterprise workflows, document flows, business intelligence,
technological watch
  * corporate knowledge management or personal information management
  * expert matching, team creation,

Integration, interoperability and reuse of web collaborative spaces:
  * integrations and interoperability with other semantic applications and
mashups
  * interlinking, distributing, federating SWCS
  * extending non-semantic social web platforms with semantics
  * exporting and reusing semantics gained from SWCS

=3D=3D Submissions and Proceedings =3D=3D

We invite the following different kinds of contributions:
 * full research or application papers (15 pages) describing recent
   research outcomes, mature work, prototypes, applications, or
   methodologies; authors of accepted full papers will be able to
   present their work in a 15 minute talk at the workshop

 * short position papers (5-10 pages) describing early work and new
   ideas that are not yet fully worked out; authors of short papers
   will be able to present their work in a 5-10 minute lightning talk
   at the workshop

 * demo outlines (5 pages) describing the demonstration of a software
   prototype in the poster and demo session during the workshop

 * poster descriptions (2 pages) outlining a poster to be presented in
   the poster and demo session during the workshop

All submissions must be written in English and must be formatted
according to the ACM format
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). Please
submit your contributions electronically in PDF format at:
