ectrical Engineering and Computer Science, Institute of Informatics.

The steering committee chair is Yannis Manolopoulos, Aristotle University o=
f Thessaloniki, Greece. The general chair of ADBIS 2019 is Tatjana Welzer, =
University of Maribor, Slovenia. The program co-chairs of ADBIS 2019 are Jo=
hann Eder, Alpen-Adria-Universit=E4t Klagenfurt, Austria and Vili Podgorele=
c, University of Maribor, Slovenia.

PUBLICATION OF ADBIS PAPERS

Full papers
Full papers will be published in the Special issue of the journal Lecture N=
otes in Computer Science (Springer). Acceptance for publication in the jour=
nal is subject to peer review. Papers should be 12-15+ pages long in the LN=
CS format. For camera-ready papers use Latex or Word style (find here: http=
://preview.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-gui=
delines).
The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if=
 it reports interesting results but does not justify the publication of a f=
ull paper.

Short papers
Accepted short papers of the main conference will be published in Communica=
tions in Computer and Information Science (Springer) series. Acceptance for=
 publication in the journal is subject to peer review. ADBIS short research=
 papers should be 6-8+ pages long in the CCIS format. The best paper author=
ed solely by students will receive an award.
Accepted workshop papers, doctoral consortium papers are also published in =
Springer=92s Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) seri=
es. For camera-ready papers use Latex or Word style (find here: http://prev=
iew.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines=
).

Further publication options
ADBIS 2019 organizing committee is negotiating with different journals for =
the best papers to be invited to be published in an extended format in a pe=
er-reviewed special issue of the journal.

Previous ADBIS proceedings are available at https://link.springer.com/confe=
rence/adbis.

GENERAL RULES

- Papers must be written in English.

 in order to have the paper published. One registered person may present up=
 to 2 contributions with one regular fee, but an additional charge is reque=
sted for publishing expenses.
- If the full paper exceeds 18 pages in LNCS format, additional charge will=
 be applied. A maximum of 22 pages per full paper is allowed.
- Accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors=
.
