General Information.=20

The preceding editions of the FCA4AI Workshop (from ECAI 2012 until ECAI 20=
20) showed that many researchers working in Artificial Intelligence are ind=
eed interested by powerful techniques for classification and data mining pr=
ovided by Formal Concept Analysis. Again, we have the chance to organize a =
new edition of the workshop in Montr=E9al, co-located with the IJCAI 2021 C=
onference.=20

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory aimed=
 at data analysis and classification. FCA allows one to build a concept lat=
tice and a system of dependencies (implications and association rules) whic=
h can be used for many AI needs, e.g. knowledge processing, knowledge disco=
very, knowledge representation and reasoning, ontology engineering as well =
as information retrieval, recommendation, social network analysis and text =
processing. Thus, there are many ``natural links'' between FCA and AI.=20

Recent years have been witnessing increased scientific activity around FCA,=
 in particular a strand of work emerged that is aimed at extending the poss=
ibilities of plain FCA w.r.t. knowledge processing, such as work on pattern=
 structures and relational context analysis, as well as on hybridization wi=
th other formalisms. These extensions are aimed at allowing FCA to deal wit=
h more complex than just binary data, for solving complex problems in data =
analysis, classification, knowledge processing... While the capabilities of=
 FCA are extended, new possibilities are arising in the framework of FCA.=
=20

As usual, the FCA4AI workshop is dedicated to discuss such issues, and in p=
articular:=20
- How can FCA support AI activities in knowledge discovery, knowledge repre=
sentation and reasoning, machine learning, natural language processing...=
=20
- By contrast, how the current developments in AI can be integrated within =
FCA to help AI researchers to solve complex problems in their domain.=20

TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to:=20
- Concept lattices and related structures: description logics, pattern stru=
ctures, relational structures.=20
- Knowledge discovery and data mining with FCA: association rules, itemsets=
 and data dependencies, attribute implications, dimensionality reduction, c=
lassification, clustering, and biclustering.=20
- Pattern mining, subgroup discovery, exceptional model mining, interesting=
ness measures, MDL-based approaches in data mining.=20
- Machine learning and hybridization: neural networks, random forests, SVM,=
 and combination of classifiers with FCA.=20
- Knowledge engineering, knowledge representation and reasoning, and ontolo=
gy engineering.=20
- Scalable and distributed algorithms for FCA and artificial intelligence, =
and for mining big data.=20
- AI tasks based on FCA: information retrieval, recommendation, social netw=
ork analysis, data visualization and navigation, pattern recognition...=20
- Practical applications in agronomy, biology, chemistry, finance, manufact=
uring, medicine...=20

The workshop will include time for audience discussion for having a better =
understanding of the issues, challenges, and ideas being presented.=20

IMPORTANT DATES:=20
Submission deadline: June 13 2021=20
Notification to authors: July 10 2021=20
Final version: July 31 2021=20
Workshop: August 21 2021=20

SUBMISSION DETAILS: The workshop welcomes submissions in pdf format in Spri=
nger's LNCS style.=20
Submissions can be:=20
- technical papers not exceeding 12 pages,=20
- system descriptions or position papers on work in progress not exceeding =
6 pages.=20

Submissions are via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3D=

The workshop proceedings will be published as CEUR proceedings (see precedi=

-1430, Vol-1257, Vol-1058, and Vol-939).=20
