We are happy to announce the opening of the registration for the 2014
Retrieving Diverse Social Images Task of the MediaEval Multimedia
Benchmark.


----------
**About the Retrieving Diverse Social Images 2014 Task**

This task is a follow-up of the 2013 edition. The task addresses the
problem of result diversification in social photo retrieval.

We use a tourist use case where a person tries to find more
information about a place she is potentially visiting. The person has
only a vague idea about the location, e.g., knowing the name of the
location. She uses the name to learn additional information about the
location from the Internet, for instance by visiting a Wikipedia page,
e.g., getting a photo, the geographical position of the place and
basic descriptions. Before deciding whether this location suits her
needs, the person is interested in getting a more complete visual
description of the place.

The participating systems are expected, given a ranked list of
location photos retrieved from Flickr using text information (up to
300 photos per query), to refine the results. The refinement consists
on providing a set of images that are in the same time relevant, e.g.,
depict partially or entirely the target location, and provide a
diversified summary, e.g., around 50 images that depict different
views of the location at different times of the day/year and under
different weather conditions, creative views, etc. Initial results are
typically noisy and redundant.

The refinement and diversification process will be based on the social
metadata associated with the images and/or on the visual
characteristics of the images.

In particular, this year we provide information about user annotation
credibility. Credibility is determined as an automatic estimation of
the quality (correctness) of a particular user's tags. Participants
are allowed to exploit this credibility estimation or to compute their
own approach, in addition to classical retrieval techniques. A
specifically designed dataset will be used to train this measure and
will be provided to the participants.
