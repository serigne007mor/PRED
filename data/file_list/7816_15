POSTDOC OFFER from connected Intelligence team, Hubert Curien Laboratory,
Saint Etienne, France

Title: Big data analyses for intelligent management of water distribution

Keywords: Data modelling, ontology, knowledge reasoning, Cloud computing,
Big Data

Website of the team : https://connected-intelligence.univ-st-etienne.fr

CONTEXT:

Water is a societal challenge at global as well as European level. Water is
a limited resource that must be managed carefully.

Water distribution networks are inherently complex. They are large systems
with feedback loops to maintain satisfactory levels of redundancy. The flow
of water is governed by the non-linear laws of hydraulics with control
devices such as valves and pumps with a wide variety of designs and
characteristics.

It is essential to pay particular attention to their safety: leak
detection, monitoring water quality, response procedures in case of water
contamination, etc. The complexity of water management is high considering
operational requirements related to the control, optimization and the need
for real-time reaction.

Laboratory Hubert Curien wants to propose an ICT based intelligent
management system for water distribution, including analysis of the large
amount of data appearing in the water systems. This project is proposed as
part of the European project (ITEA 2) Water-M. Water-M aims to develop an
architecture for intelligent management of water distribution.

GOAL:

The postdoc will join the team "Connected Intelligence" of Hubert Curien
laboratory / Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet / Telecom Saint-Etienne. The new t=
heme
"Connected Intelligence" in the laboratory consists of specialists in
knowledge representation and reasoning, multi-agent systems and services in
social networks, virtual communities and recommendation. This theme brings
together researchers with expertise related themes including: processing
and data management, cloud architectures, knowledge representation and
reasoning in large scale environments, linking the Internet of Things and
Cloud.

The postdoc will work on the design of an architecture and algorithms for
managing the distribution of water, especially for the tariff negotiation
and distributed coordination. Application complexity and the huge volume of
data to be processed require adaptation strategies of software architecture
at different levels. Tariff negotiation algorithms will be completely
redesigned. Software architecture should be based on the elasticity of
cloud and the generic set of software components.

Ontologies will be created for describing data processing rules, rules of
application and IT resource allocation rules distributed. The architecture
and algorithms that will be defined and prototyped in this work will
exploit the capabilities offered by the intelligent and smart meters and
sensors. The counters and intelligent and communicating sensors to regular
statements or on demand will allow a much better water control by managers
and users. This data flow management platform will also be part of the
architecture.

The architecture and algorithms with the given platforms will help to make
scalable and distributed processing. In addition, they will allow to make
tariff negotiation and coordination in the distribution of energy and
water. An architecture of "Cloud" will adapt to increasing data volumes and
infrastructure needs. This project addresses the needs of cities and
territories that represent the interests of citizens and businesses that
are directly involved in decisions about water networks, as prime
contractor, or live operator of the system. The main objective is to
optimize the functioning of water distribution networks based on Big data
analysis and alerting.

This work will thus provide :
- academic results on the themes of cloud computing, knowledge
representation and reasoning in large scale environments, the connection
between the Internet of Things and cloud.
- applicative results as a prototype in the Water-M project demonstrating
the interest of the defined models and algorithms

CONTRACT:

Contract of 18 months (1 yr with the possibility to extend for 6 more
months) and the starting date is February 1, 2015. Remuneration will be
based on experience.

REQUIRED PROFILE:

PhD in Computer Science with 0-3 years experience
knowledge of topics: Data modelling, ontology, knowledge reasoning, Cloud
computing, Big Data
Java, C / C ++
mastery of English : very good level
ability to work in team, in an industrial and international environment


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR APPLICATION:

Please send the following to kamal.singh@univ-st-etienne.fr and evaluations
will begin starting from mid December 2015:

CV and a list of publications

Cover letter with your research statement detailing your
motivations and research goals related to this postdoc offer

Two letters of references with contact persons
