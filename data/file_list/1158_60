*EUROVIS 2010 Call for Posters & Demos*

We invite you to participate in EuroVis 2010 Poster/Demo session, to be 
held in Bordeaux, France, June 9-11, 2010.

Poster/demo abstract submissions are due April 09 2010.

EuroVis 2010 is the annual Visualization Symposium, jointly
organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization and
the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee. All poster 
presenters are encouraged to bring a laptop to present
demos and/or videos. In addition to the poster session itself, where
all presenters will concurrently discuss their work with EuroVis
attendees, there will be a fast-forward session where presenters will
have 60 seconds each to preview their work to the whole audience.

Posters/Demos is a venue for several kinds of work. We welcome
preliminary findings that are not mature enough for a full paper,
interesting work with a contribution smaller than a typical research
paper (student projects often fall into this category), or
late-breaking research where you would benefit from feedback from the
community before writing it up as a full paper. There is no explicit
research novelty requirement; for instance, we welcome demonstrations
of open-source software even if its research aspects have already been
published in another venue, presentations of commercial visualization
software, or videos showing visualization systems in action. Although
a full literature review is not expected, the most relevant previous
work should be cited, particularly if new research results are presented.

The collection of accepted abstracts will be distributed to conference
attendees (xeroxed, black and white only), but they will not be
included in the archival proceedings or indexed in a digital library.
Thus, posters do not preclude the later submission of work as a full
research paper at EuroVis or another venue.

Each poster abstract will be read and evaluated by the Conference
Chairs. Submissions will be evaluated based on whether the content is
suitable for EuroVis and not a repetition of the work of others.
Authors of posters that are not accepted will receive summary reviews
of their poster from the chairs explaining the decision and providing
feedback.

Suggested topics for posters and demos include, but are not limited to:

  * Visualization Taxonomies and Models
  * Spatial Data in Visualization
  * Non-Spatial Data (Information Visualization)
  * Visualization Techniques
  * Interaction in Visualization
  * Visual Analytics, Visual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
  * Large Data Visualization
  * Hardware for Visualization
  * Visual Design
  * Cognition and Perception
  * Design Studies
  * Novel Algorithms, Applied Mathematics
  * Distributed, collaborative, mobile/ubiquitous visualization
  * Evaluation and User Studies
  * Visualization Systems

We also encourage submission of application oriented posters dealing
with visualization in different domains, e.g.

  * Physical Sciences and Engineering
  * Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences
  * Bioinformatics, Life Sciences, Medical Research and Applications
  * Information Sciences
  * Business and Finance
  * Software Development
  * Humanities, Social Sciences, Education

Before submitting a poster and/or demo abstract, please visit the
Eurovis 2010 website for more details (www.eurovis.org).
