Description & Objectives
The generalisation of digital technology has generated a huge amount of =
data, collected from various sources, and that can be spread out in =
different places.=20
Mining multiple sources of data to discover useful information is of =
critical importance for decision making. Indeed, these data sources can =
represent several dimensions or points of view about a phenomenon. =
However, how to efficiently mine quality information from multiple data =
sources is still a challenging task for current research, as in real =
world applications, data stored in multiple places by different, owned =
by different stakeholder, often conflict: data name, format, value or =
point of view may be different. Furthermore, data can be heterogeneous =
in their structure, sequential or not, ?
The main objective of the1st International Workshop on Multi-Source Data =
Mining (MSDM)  is to discuss promising and recent research, applicative =
problems and results behind current multi data source mining.=20
We invite you to participate in the 1st  edition of the International =
Workshop on Multi-Source Data Mining (MSDM), to be held during the IEEE =
International Conference on Data Mining ? ICDM =
(https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz) =
<https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz/>https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz =
<https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz/>), 2021 in Auckland, New Zealand.
The workshop's aim is to contribute to bringing together approaches =
defined or used, when data sources are multiple, possibly heterogeneous, =
represent multiple points of view, are possibly linked, even through =
time, including from the applicative point of view.

Topics of interest
We welcome contributions of researchers and practitioners, including =
preliminary works and results and position papers, that address (but are =
not limited to) the following topics of interest:
- Algorithms and models for multi-source data mining
- Multi-relational data mining
- Heterogeneous data mining (including graph, structured/semi-structured =
data, text, spatio-temporal, time-series, streaming data)=20
- Multi-dimensional data mining
- Redescription mining
- Temporal multi-source mining
- Big data mining
- Practical applications of multi source data mining, including =
recommender systems, user modelling, prediction and prescription, etc.

Submissions
Authors are encouraged to send their contribution of max 8 pages plus 2 =
extra pages in the IEEE 2-column format, including the bibliography and =
any possible appendices.=20
Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All =
submissions will be peer reviewed by the Workshop Program Committee on =
the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the workshop, =
originality, significance, and clarity.=20
For paper submission, please proceed to the submission website.
