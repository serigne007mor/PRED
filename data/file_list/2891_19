early June 2022.
Comprising a Main Conference, Special Sessions and Doctoral Consortium

*Scope of the conference *
The conference aims to bring together researchers, students and 
practitioners of pattern
recognition and artificial intelligence, to present and discuss new 
advances. The main topics of
interest are gathered in four scientific tracks (but are not limited to):
• Pattern recognition: recognition of different types of patterns, 
feature extraction /
selection and evaluation, structural / statistical approaches
• Computer vision: image processing / analysis, segmentation, object 
recognition, scene
understanding
• Artificial intelligence: machine / deep learning, expert systems, 
system interpretability,
knowledge representation, perception, semantic analysis, intelligent 
systems
• Big data: data visualization, volume / velocity / data variety, small 
sample size,
supercomputing, cloud, data mining and performance evaluation

With applications related to: handwriting, document, text, language 
processing, e-learning,
image processing / analysis, bio-medical imaging, remote sensing, image 
retrieval, 2D / 3D
images and graphics, audio / video, multimedia applications, security 
and forensic studies,
mobile applications, face, fingerprint, iris, brain, strategic objects 
and targets, industrial
applications of PRAI, innovation and technology transfer, financial 
trends and analysis, traffic
analysis and smart transportation systems, robotics and autonomous 
vehicles ...

Special Sessions (SS) that complement the regular program of the 
conference.
We consider two major opportunities:

Intelligence: proofs, new
algorithms and models, …
2. SS focused on application area, e.g. cultural heritage, medical 
applications, remote sens-
ing, ...
5 papers for a Special Session are expected
Researchers willing to submit a proposal for a special session should 
provide a proposition in
a single pdf file. The submission file should be prepared using the 
following template and
should contain the following information:
• A title for the Special Session and the names of the organizers;
• Brief biographies of the session organizer(s) and their contact 
information;
• Brief description of the theme and importance of the Session, number 
of submissions
expected (1 page);
• Proposal of particular PC committee (name, country, 
institution/research lab);
• List of potential contributors and topics of interest.
Proposals should be sent directly by email to the Special Session 
Chairs: jenny.benois-
pineau@u-bordeaux.fr and rdl@ufpe.br
For more details see: https://icprai2022.sciencesconf.org/special_sessions

*Doctoral Consortium *
The goal of the ICPRAI 2022 Doctoral Consortium is to create an 
opportunity for Ph.D.
students to test their research ideas, present their current progress 
and future plans, and receive
constructive criticism and insights related to their future work and 
career perspectives. A mentor
(a senior researcher who is active in the field) will be assigned to 
each student to provide
individual feedback. In addition, students will have the opportunity to 
present an overview of
their research plan during a special poster session.
Participation in the ICPRAI 2022 Doctoral Consortium will be limited to 
25 students.
Prospective participants are encouraged to submit their application by 
March 14th. The
Doctoral Consortium Committee will then review all applications 
received. Preference will be
given to students who are at a stage in their studies most likely to 
benefit (i.e., they have
identified a research direction and published some initial results, but 
the thesis is not yet set in
stone).
Participation to the Doctoral Consortium will be free for all accepted 
students, i.e., there will
be no extra registration fees!
The ICPRAI 2022 Doctoral Consortium will take place the day before the 
main conference,
i.e., on Tuesday, Mai 31.
Proposals should be sent directly by email to the Doctoral Consortium
Chairs: veronique.eglin@insa-lyon.fr and lopresti@cse.lehigh.edu

*Call for ICPRAI2022 competitions *

The ICPRAI 2022 organizing committee invites proposals for competitions 
that aim at evaluating the performance of algorithms and methods related 
to areas of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

You are cordially invited to submit a proposal, that should contain the 
following information:

     A brief description of the competition, including what the 
particular task under evaluation is and why this competition is of 
interest to the ICPRAI community;
     A draft of the outline of the competition describing competition 
schedule, the expected number of participants and its rationale, which 
data is planned to be used, how will the submitted methods be evaluated 
and which performance measures will be used;
     The names, contact information, and brief CVs of the competition 
organizers, outlining previous experience in performance evaluation 
and/or organizing competitions.

The following rules shall apply to the accepted Competitions:

     Name of competition must be standardized by starting with “ICPRAI 
2022” e.g. “ICPRAI 2022 Competition on …” or “ICPRAI 2022 … Competition”;
     Datasets used in the competitions must be made available after the 
end of the competitions. In principle, the organizers should submit the 
dataset to the competition chairs, so that the data could be pooled with 
the ICPRAI community;
     Evaluation methodologies and metrics used must be described in 
detail so that results can be replicated later;
     The results of competitions will be announced during a dedicated 
session of the ICPRAI 2022 conference;
     The basic length of reports of competitions is the same as the 
regular paper (i.e., 12 pages of Springer LNCS format, see Author 
guidelines). If there are circumstances to be considered, upon request, 
Competition Chairs may allow additional pages;
     Each competition has to be presented with a poster at a prominent 
place at the conference venue, selected competitions will get the chance 
to be presented orally in the dedicated session mentioned above.

Based on the analysis of the received proposals, the competitions chairs 
will first synchronize with the competition organizers and then submit a 
proposal to the program committee, in order to finalize the organization 
of the competitions.
Submission Guidelines

All proposals (in .pdf format) should be submitted by electronic mail to 
the competition chairs (Jean-Marc Ogier and Cheng-Lin Liu) via:
