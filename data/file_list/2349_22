          </b><b>Context:</b><br>
          In many applications, the data to be studied is of relational
          nature, modeled in the form of a network and represented by
          graphs. This representation makes possible the study of
          interactions between people, especially in social sciences.
          Although network analysis is an active branch of data mining
          and machine learning, a majority of works focuses on
          homogeneous networks de-scribed by a simple graph where the
          nodes correspond to the entities of the network and the links
          (edges or arcs) to their relationships.=C2=A0 However, in many
          applications, contextual infor-mation describing the
          relationships or the entities themselves are available and
          could be used to study in a more efficient way the network. <br=
>
          This led notably to the notions of signed graphs and
          attributed graphs. In a signed graph, each edge is labeled
          with either a negative or a positive sign, which allows
          representing antagonistic relationships [1].=C2=A0 In an attrib=
uted
          network, vertices are described by attributes which allow to
          take into account their individual characteristics, like for
          instance their genre or age [2].<br>
          These representations are much richer than a simple graph and
          permit to better model com-plex interaction systems. However,
          they require to adapt existing algorithms or to design new
          ones for solving efficiently all standard network
          visualization and analysis tasks, such as com-munity
          detection, link prediction or information diffusion.<br>
          This=C2=A0 PhD is part of the French Research project DeCoMaP
          (Detecting Corruption in Markets for Public Procurement)
          funded by the ANR (French NSF) which aims at retrieving,
          processing and analyzing open data related to French public
          procurements, in order to design a tool able to assess
          corruption risks between public buyers and suppliers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Subject:</b><br>
          Designing automatic tools for the assessment of risks of
          corruption in public procurements is a task called red
          flagging. It is not completely new, as some teams have been
          working on it for a few years [1], especially at the European
          level [2]. However, none of them applies to French public
          procurements, as they do not handle its specifics (legal
          framework, nature and form of the available open data).
          Moreover, existing approaches focus on individual information,
          which characterize buyers and suppliers independently, and
          ignore relational information, which cor-responds to
          interactions and interdependencies between these agents.<br>
          In the context of the project DoCoMaP, we propose to design a
          new tool tackling these issues and limitations. More
          specifically, the goal of this thesis is to handle a large
          methodological part of this work, by representing the
          relationships between buyers and suppliers (normal
          con-tractual relationship or corruption) and by characterizing
          these agents through signed and/or attributed graphs. <br>
          As this type of graphs has been much less explored than simple
          graphs in the literature, the first task of this thesis
          consists in designing methods to extract them from the raw
          data, and to analyze them in the context of our application
          (corruption detection). In particular, it is neces-sary to
          define a corruption index that could be used to enrich the
          information already available in the graph at the level of its
          links (contracts between a public buyer and a supplier) and at
          the level of its vertices (characteristics of the actors).<br>
          The second task focuses on signed graph partitioning in the
          framework of structural balance [3]. A signed graph is said to
          be balanced if it can be partitioned into two [4] or more [5]
          mutu-ally hostile subgroups, each having internal solidarity
          (i.e. positive edges are inside clusters, and negative ones
          are between them). Some recent works started tackling this
          problem notably in our team [6], but there is still much to do
          for formalizing the problem and solving it efficiently,
          particularly using deep learning approaches [7]. In DeCoMap,
          signed graph partitioning will aim to bring out groups of
          agents (public buyers and supplier companies) likely to be
          related in fraudulent practices.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Working environment:</b><br>
          The PhD candidate will work at the Laboratoire Informatique
          d=E2=80=99Avignon (LIA =E2=80=93 EA 4128) under the supervision=
 of Vincent
          Labatut and Rosa Figueiredo (LIA =E2=80=93 Avignon Universit=C3=

          Science (LabHC =E2=80=93 Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet, Saint-Eti=

          France).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Funding:</b><br>
          The PhD fellowship is funded for 3 years through the ongoing
          DeCoMaP ANR project (ANR-19-CE38-0004) and is monthly funded
          about approximatively 1500 =E2=82=AC.<br>
