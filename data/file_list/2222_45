Beyond Facts - 1st International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online 
Discourse (KnOD)

https://knod2020.wordpress.com/

Collocated with ESWC 2020 - the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2020
May 31 - June 4, Heraklion (Crete, Greece)

-----------
Workshop
-----------

Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to 
the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims 
and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts 
(events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights 
for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo 
chambers or political agenda setting.  While knowledge graphs (KGs) 
promise to provide the key to a Web of structured information, they are 
mainly focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity, 
connection or temporal evolution of online discourse data. As opposed to 
facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly 
depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended 
meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly 
diverge across communities from computational social science, to 
argumentation mining, fact-checking, or viewpoint/stance detection.

This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these 
communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, 
extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the 
need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse 
data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and 
reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the 
analysis of societal debates on the Web.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Ontologies and data models for online discourse data
- Reuse and extension of existing models such as schema.org and Wikidata
- KGs and knowledge extraction techniques in the context of online 
discourse
- Computational fact-checking / truth discovery
- Bias and controversy detection and analysis
- Stance and viewpoint discovery
- Rumour, propaganda and hate-speech detection
- Integration, aggregation, linking and enrichment of discourse data
- Semantic and exploratory search of online discourse data
- Argumentation and reasoning over online discourse
- Recommender systems for discourse data
- Quality, uncertainty, provenance, and trust of discourse data
- Benchmarks and training data for extraction, verification or linking 
of discourse data
- Use-cases, applications and cross-community interfaces

-----------
Submission and Publication
-----------

The workshop welcomes the following types of contributions:

- Full papers (up to 14 pages): original research of relevance to the 
workshop topics
- Short papers (up to 6 pages): research in progress of relevance to the 
workshop topics
- Posters (up to 4 pages): vision & position statements or work in 
progress
- Demo and system papers (up to 4 pages): descriptions of prototypes, 
demos or systems

All submissions must be written in English and must be formatted in the 
style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see Springer’s Author 
Instructions: 
https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

Please submit your contributions electronically in PDF format via the 
EasyChair conference submission system: 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=knod2020

Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, 
technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. At 
least one author of each accepted contribution must register for the 
workshop and present the paper. The accepted papers will be published 
online in CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org). Pre-prints of all 
contributions will be made available during the conference. Authors of 
all accepted papers will be given the possibility to present their work 
also as a poster during a dedicated poster session.

-----------
Awards
-----------

All contributions are eligible for the "Best Paper" award, which will be 
awarded to the best contribution during the closing session. In 
addition, the workshop organisation team is planning to invite selected 
workshop submissions to a dedicated journal special issue.
