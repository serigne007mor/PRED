Introduction:

One of hot topics in ICT is currently undergoing rapid advancements and
emerging on the spot as one of the priority research areas, whose research
activities are booming recently: context-aware systems (CAS), which is
primarily inspired by the human autonomic nervous system. CAS is
characterized by its self-* facets such as self-organization,
self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, self-protection and so
on whose context-awareness used to dynamically control computing and
networking functions. The overall goal of CAS is to realize nature-inspired
autonomic systems that can manage themselves without direct human
interventions. Meeting this grand challenge of CAS requires a rigorous
interdisciplinary approach to context-aware systems. To this end, ICCASA
2012 organizers welcome participation and contributions from those working
or interested in the intersection of approaches for supporting
context-aware systems.
Goals:

The ICCASA 2012sponsored by ICST (a member of EAI) and NTT University
(NTTU) is a place for highly original ideas about how CAS is going to shape
networked computing systems of the future. Hence, it focuses on rigorous
approaches and cutting-edge solutions which break new ground in dealing
with the properties of context-awareness. Its purpose is to make a formal
basis more accessible to researchers, scientists, professionals and
students as well as developers and practitioners in ICT by providing them
with state-of-the-art research results, applications, opportunities and
future trends.
Scope:

Original papers are solicited for the ICCASA 2012. In particular,
theoretical contributions should be formally stated and justified, and
practical applications should be based on their firm formal basis.
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
Fundamentals of Context-aware systems:

   - Context-aware models
   - Context-aware control
   - Context-aware algorithms
   - Context-aware networks
   - Context-aware computing
   - Context-awareness calculi
   - Context-awareness representation
   - Context-awareness-based systems
   - Logic in context-awareness
   - Context-awareness reasoning
   - Formal methods of context-awareness
   - Context-awareness-based optimization and swarm Intelligence
   - Knowledge-based awareness

Context-aware Communications:

   - Routing, transport, and reliability issues of context-aware systems
   - Techniques for data dissemination and replication in context-aware
   systems
   - Applications and middleware support, mobile social networking
   applications
   - Mobility models and statistical analysis of mobility traces
   - Context and social awareness mechanisms and algorithms
   - Co-existence of opportunistic networks with infrastructure mobile
   wireless networks
   - Service composition in autonomic and opportunistic networks
   - Cognition-driven information processing and decision making
   - Performance modeling, scaling laws, and fundamental limits for
   autonomic and opportunistic communications
   - Game-theoretic insights to the operation of autonomic and
   opportunistic networks
   - Participatory and urban sensing in autonomic and opportunistic networks
   - Trust, security, and reputation -Autonomic and opportunistic
   communication testbeds and prototypes, measurement data from real
   experiments
   - Socio-economic models for autonomic and opportunistic communications

Context-aware Technologies: -Context-aware information retrieval

   - Context-aware profiling, clustering and collaborative filtering
   - Machine learning for context-aware information retrieval and ontology
   learning
   - Context-aware e-learning/tutoring
   - Ubiquitous and context-aware computing
   - Use of context-aware technologies in UI/HCI
   - Context-aware advertising
   - Recommendations for mobile users
   - Context-awareness in portable devices
   - Context-aware services
   - Social Agents and Avatars
   - Emotion and Personality
   - Virtual Humans
   - Autonomous Actors
   - Awareness-based Animation
   - Social and Conversational Agents
   - Inter-Agent Communication
   - Social Behavior
   - Crowd Simulation
   - Understanding Human Activity
   - Memory and Long-term Interaction

Submission Guidelines:

Official conference proceedings of ICCASA 2012 will appear in the Lecture
Notes of ICST (LNICST) series jointly published by ICST and Springer and
indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, ISI Proceedings, EI, CrossRef and
Zentralblatt Math. All papers must be submitted electronically in PDF
format via the paper management system CONFY using the link on conference
web site. There are two options for the submissions, either a full paper or
a short paper. We decided to allow the submission of short papers in order
to accommodate the most recent research outcomes. The submissions should be
formatted with single-spaced, single-column pages using on A4 or letter
pages in Springer LNICST style format. The maximum number of pages is 10
for full papers. Authors should submit a 4-page single-column manuscript
for short papers. The camera-ready version of an accepted full (short)
paper cannot exceed 10 (4) pages. Detailed formatting and submission
instructions will be available on the conference web site. All accepted
papers will appear in Springer LNICST proceedings only if at least one of
the authors attends to present the paper.
Selected Journal Publication:

Some of the selected papers will be invited for the special issue of *Mobile
Networks and Applications (MONET) journal* (SCIE-indexed) (confirmed) and *=
ICST
Transactions on Dynamic Resource Management*,* on Ambient Systems* and *on
Ubiquitous Environments* (planning) after further revisions.
