use cases of value to the project, using real data to solve real data
analytics problems, which can be generalised to other similar problems in
the context of a smart city.

Specific tasks:
* Test and assess the result of machine learning approaches on concrete use
cases with multiple datasets.
* Generalise the results obtained from these use cases, to create novel data
preparation, mining and interpretation approaches working on combinations of
heterogeneous, unbalanced datasets.
* Create generic data analytics and mining services widely applicable to
the MK:Smart project and other similar ones.
* Integrate results in the technical infrastructure of the MK:Smart
project, and collaborate with other members of the team on requirements and
implementations for data management.

The appointment will be made on the Academic Grade 1 or 2 Salary Scales for
