The University of Saint-Etienne (France) invites applications for a
*fully funded 3-year PhD position* at the Hubert-Curien lab.

Main points of the studentship:
*Data mining on stress and emotion information and e-health communities
*Starting date is about October, 1st  2010.
*In cooperation with the University of Tokyo (Living Environment
Laboratory)

This project concerns the design of new data mining algorithms to
exploit the symbolic data resulting from stress and emotion data
transformation, in order to make discoveries (abnormal evolution signs,
regular patterns, etc.). This knowledge will be used in e-health
community services to implement scenarios such as user support, group
debriefing, emergency processes.

The selected candidate will join the machine learning group composed of
about 20 researchers working at the crossroads of data mining, machine
learning, information retrieval and social networks.

Candidates must have demonstrable interest and expertise in data mining
as well as in knowledge modeling and e-health. A background in
psychology is highly desirable but not essential. A good level in
English is also essential. Some interest in the Japanese culture is also
desirable. Applicants should have or be in the process of getting a
*Master's degree in Computer Science*.

Applications with a CV (including grades of the last two academic years)
should be sent to:
pierre.maret@univ-st-etienne.fr and fabrice.muhlenbach@univ-st-etienne.fr
by April, 18th 2010 at the latest.

-The closest airport is Lyon Saint Exupéry (http://www.lyon.aeroport.fr).
-The city is surrounded by the Pilat Regional Parc in which almost any
outdoor activity can be practiced (http://www.parc-naturel-pilat.fr/eng/).
-From a cultural point of view, the art museum in Saint-Etienne holds
the second national contemporary art collection, and classical music
concerts, dance shows, and operas are performed at the Saint-Etienne
"Massenet Opera" (http://www.decouvrez-le-votre.com/).
