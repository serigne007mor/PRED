SUBJECT AREA DESCRIPTION AND MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nowadays, a business intelligence (BI) technology is a worldwide
accepted and obligatory component of information systems deployed in
companies and institutions. From a technological point of view, BI
includes a few layers. The first one is an ETL layer whose goal is to
integrate data coming from heterogeneous, distributed, and autonomous
data sources, which include operational databases and other storage
systems. The integrated data are stored in a central database, called
a data warehouse (DW), located in the second layer. Based on the central
DW, smaller thematically-oriented data warehouses can be build. They are
called data marts (DM). Data stored in a DW or DM are analyzed by
multiple applications, located in the third layer.

An inherent feature of the data sources that fed the BI architecture
with data is that in practice  they evolve in time independently of
the BI architecture. The evolution of the data sources can be
characterized by content changes, i.e., insert/update/delete data,
and schema changes, i.e., add/modify/drop a data structure or its
property. Handling content changes at a DW can be  implemented by
means of: (1) temporal extensions, (2) materialized views, and
(3) data versioning mechanisms.

The propagation of structural changes into the BI architecture is much
more challenging as it requires modifications in all the layers in this
architecture, forcing the layers to evolve. Three basic approaches to
handling the evolution of data warehouses were proposed by research
communities. These approaches are classified as: (1) schema evolution,
(2) schema versioning, and (3) data warehouse versioning. Even though
a decent contribution was made in this research area, there still exist
multiple open research and technological problems, like querying
heterogeneous DW versions, efficient indexing multiversion data,
integrity constraints for mutliversion DW schemas, modeling multiversion
DWs. To the best of our knowledge, no solutions were proposed so far to
support the evolution of the ETL layer and the analytical applications
layer.

We observe that the research on evolving BI systems is still very 
active.
Recently R. Kimball proposed the extension to its SCD concept, extending
it with SCD type 4 to 7. The international research conferences and
journals publish papers on evolving BI systems, e.g., DaWaK 2014,
EDA 2014, EDA 2015, TIME 2014, Information Systems 2015.

Handling multiple and evolving states of some entities is a more
general problem. An intensive research is conducted also in the areas
of versioning XML documents and versioning ontologies. Last but not
least, some NoSQL storage systems support versioning of data, e.g.,
HBase, Cassandra.

AIMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this workshop is twofold. Firstly, to gather those
researchers and possibly industry developers who focus on handling
dynamics in business intelligence systems, in order to discuss their
achievements and open issues. Secondly, to communicate to the BI
community still open issues and to inspire them to conduct research
in this area.

The MEBIS workshop would be the second in the series of workshops
devoted to research on evolving BI systems. The first one was organized
in conjunction with ADBIS 2009.

WORKSHOP DURATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full day: 9:00 am - 6 pm, including at least two 90-minutes sessions
+ closing discussion.


Best regards.
