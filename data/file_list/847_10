CALL FOR PAPERS

We would like to invite you to submit a paper to=20
the International Journal of Biomedical=20
Engineering and Technology (ISSN: 1470-9503).

SPECIAL EDITION: "Warehousing and Mining Complex=20
Data: Applications to Biology, Medicine, Behavior, Health and Environment"

The intention of the Editors of the Special=20
Edition is to present a collection of manuscripts=20
that discuss novel and innovative applications of=20
decision-support technologies such as data=20
warehousing and data mining in medicine and=20
biology. In these disciplines, data are nowadays=20
not only numerical or symbolic, but they may be=20
termed complex. For instance, the development of=20
electronic health records enables=20
information-based medicine, which requires the=20
analysis of various, heterogeneous data, such as=20
patient records, medical images, biological=20
analysis results, and so on. Moreover, these data=20
are often represented in various formats=20
(databases, texts, images, sounds, videos...),=20
diversely structured (relational databases, XML=20
documents repository...), originating from=20
several different sources (distributed databases,=20
the Web...), described through several channels=20
or points of view (radiographies and audio=20
diagnosis of a physician, data expressed in=20
different scales or languages...), or changing in=20
terms of definition or value (temporal databases,=20
periodical surveys...). Managing complex data=20
involves a lot of different issues regarding=20
their structure, storage and analysis.

The emphasis of this special issue is on critical=20
issues pertaining to managing, processing and=20
analyzing complex data for decision-support.=20
Particular emphasis will be put on novel and=20
unique applications in the fields of biology,=20
medicine, behavior, health or environment.

This includes but is not limited to the following=20
topics (within the fields of biology, medicine,=20
behavior, health, environment...):
- Complex data description languages and formats
- Complex data integration
- Complex data warehouse foundations, design and architectures
- XML data warehousing
- Complex data warehouse consistency and quality
- Multidimensional modeling of complex data
- OLAP on complex data
- Mining different data formats
- Combining mining results from different sources
- Mining data streams
- Combining OLAP and data mining for complex data analysis
- Human-machine interfaces for complex data mining
- Management of metadata and domain-related knowledge
- Interoperability and heterogeneity
- Exploiting metadata or domain-related knowledge in the analysis process
- Application domains: biology, medicine, behavior, health, environment...

International Journal of Biomedical Engineering=20
and Technology is an internationally recognized=20
("1st tier") scientific publication devoted to=20
the assessment and management of risk.  The peer=20
reviewed papers published in the Journal are=20
listed at all relevant bibliographic/reference=20
databases.  To assure that the Special Edition=20
maintains the outstanding scientific quality of=20
the journal, all manuscripts will be subjected to=20
a "double blind" review by at least two independent reviewers.

Manuscript Format:

Manuscript: The main body of the manuscript must=20
not exceed 8.000 words (longer manuscripts will=20
be returned).   The word count does not include=20
tables, figure legends or references.

- The title page giving the names, affiliations=20
and complete addresses with emails of all the authors.
- Informative abstract must not exceed 250 words
- Maximum 10 key words following the abstract
- All sections of the manuscript (e.g.,=20
Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions) must be consecutively numbered
- Place name of the author (if several authors,=20
list the last name of the first followed by "et=20
al." ) and a brief running title (not more than 5 words)
- All pages including title page must be consecutively numbered

Figures: Please, submit all figures either as=20
Power Point diagrams or high density JPG files=20
numbered in the order as they are listed in the manuscript.

- There is no limit on the number of=20
figures.  However the authors are encouraged to=20
keep them to the absolutely minimum=20
necessary.  The Editors may request reduction in=20
the number of figures submitted by the author(-s).
- All figures will be printed as black and=20
white.  Therefore, while creating diagrams or=20
including photographs, please make sure that=20
adequate sharpness and contrast exists.  Unclear=20
figures will be either subject to re-editing by=20
the author or will be eliminated by the Editors.

Tables: As with figures, authors are encouraged=20
to keep these to an absolute minimum.
