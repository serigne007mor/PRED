Postdoc or research engineer position in Paris, France: Deep Learning for Multivariate and Heterogeneous Time Series.


The machine learning group at University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) in Paris, is looking for a highly motivated postdoc on the topic “Deep learning for multivariate and heterogeneous time series”.

This work is part of a EU-RFCS project “Predictive Sensor Data Mining for Product Quality Improvement” (PRESED). The general goal of the PRESED project is the improvement of quality of steel production plants by the online analysis of multiple sensor data. The sensors provide complex multivariate and heterogeneous time series covering the whole production chain. The objective of the postdoc is the development of new statistical methodologies based on deep learning and representation learning for the analysis of such time series. This topic offers a unique opportunity to explore and extend the field of deep learning on complex temporal data and will be conducted in close collaboration with ArcelorMittal Global R&D (coordinator of the European project).

The successful candidate will have a strong background in machine learning, applied statistics or related fields. He should also have an experience in large size experimental data analysis. Preference will be given to candidates with sufficient programming skills.

The appointment is initially for one year (extendable depending on work progress), starting between  October  and December 2015. Gross annual salary is in the range 27, 000 – 35, 000 euros depending on the qualification.

UPMC is in the center of Paris and is one of the foremost scientific universities in France. The position is opened at the Machine Learning and Information Access (MLIA) team, whose core research is machine learning with applications in semantic (text and image) data analysis. The team is composed of 3 professors and 3 assistant professors plus around 10 PhDs and Postdocs.
Candidates should send a CV and an accompanying letter to:

  patrick.gallinari@lip6.fr.
