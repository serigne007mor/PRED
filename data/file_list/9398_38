Call for Papers 

3rd
International Symposium, Visualisation in Business Intelligence and Open
Data 

21, 22, 23 and 24 July 2015 

The University of Barcelona ●
Barcelona ● Spain ● 

http://www.graphicslink.co.uk/IV2015/VBI_OD.htm
[1] 

As a part of IV2015 - 19th International Conference Information
Visualisation 

 http://www.graphicslink.co.uk/IV2015/ [2] 

This VBI-OD
session focuses on two important issues and inter-dependent domains in
which visualisations can play a key role. Business Intelligence (BI) is
a domain where data, knowledge and users are tightly related. Data in BI
are stored in Data Warehouses and are generally large, heterogeneous,
geo-localized and time-dependent. Visualisations in BI must be intuitive
and must support an interactive, collaborative and ubiquitous discovery
process. These visualisations must deal both with the exploration of
data and knowledge, and also with the presentation of results to
managers. 

 Open Data (OD) share common properties with BI from the
data analysis and visualisation points of view. OD represents a recent
issue that concerns the free delivery of a huge amount of information
produced by public or privateorganizations and other data providers.
Such Open Datasets cover various topics including politics, taxes,
citizens, cities, health, education etc. The users who wish to explore
such datasets are often citizens, journalists, politicians,managers and
other data or business analysts. In this area, the visualisations are
expected to help the users in their exploration of this huge amount of
information. This may concern various aspects of visual and interactive
methods (overview of a large collection of Open datasets, details on an
dataset, interactive discovery, user interfaces, aesthetics, etc). 

BI
and OD thus represent important challenges in the visualisation domain.
The aim of this symposium is precisely to make a state of the art and to
contribute to these challenging objectives by covering all aspects of
interactive visualisations in BI and OD, from both a theoretical and
practical point of view. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:


 	* Visual OLAP and visualisations for data cubes, dynamic cross
tables, dashboards, scorecards, key performance indicators, reporting,
CRM, market basket analysis, strategic watch,
 	* Visualisations for
Open Data in various domains (health, education, politics, ...)
 	*
Visual assistants, data to visualisation mappings, user feedback,
 	*
User interfaces for BI and OD (collaborative, ubiquitous) and aesthetics
in visualisations, use of new technologies
 	* Visualisation of
time-dependent data, geo-localized data, maps, multidimensional data,
hierarchies, big data
 	* Interactions, interactive knowledge discovery,
visual operators on data and knowledge, graphical requests, visual
analytics for BI and OD
 	* User evaluations and case studies, reports
on real cases and experiments
