CALL FOR PAPERS

Second  International Conference on Belief functions Compiègne, France, 
9-11 May 2012
Special session on Uncertain Knowledge Management

http://www.hds.utc.fr/belief2012
==================================================

The submissions to the special session must be made as a regular paper 
and will be review with the same process.

If you are interested by this special session, just send us an email.

Uncertain Knowledge Management
Organizers: Boutheina Ben Yaghlane (boutheina.byaghlane@planet.tn) and 
Arnaud Martin (Arnaud.Martin@univ-rennes1.fr)

The field of uncertain knowledge management presents a number of 
challenges in terms of collecting, representing, modeling, querying, 
indexing and mining the knowledge. Such knowledge may be uncertain. The 
theory of belief functions is considered as a useful theory for 
representing and managing uncertain knowledge. This theory was 
introduced by Shafer as a model to represent quantified beliefs. The 
objective of the special session is to provide a forum for the 
discussion of recent advances and results of several aspects of the use 
of the belief function theory to manage knowledge. Thus, original papers 
with theoretical and/or practical contributions are solicited. Topics of 
interest include but are not limited to the following topics related to 
the use of belief function theory for the management of uncertain 
knowledge namely Information fusion, Data mining, Machine learning, 
Graphical models, Web semantics, etc.


PUBLICATION
All accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in a volume of 
the series "Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing" (indexed in ISI 
Proceedings, DBLP. Ulrich's, EI-Compendex, SCOPUS, Zentralblatt Math, 
MetaPress, Springerlink). Authors of selected papers from the BELIEF 
2012 conference will be invited to submit an extended version of their 
papers for possible inclusion in a special issue of the International 
Journal of Approximate Reasoning.

PAPER SUBMISSION
Full papers (8 pages) are due by 1 December, 2011. All accepted papers 
will be presented either in single-track oral sessions, or in poster 
sessions.

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission: 16 December, 2011
Notification of acceptance: 20 January, 2012
Final paper submission: 15 February, 2012
