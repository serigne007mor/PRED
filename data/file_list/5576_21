Currently, agriculture is at a crossroads. There has been an increase in =
the world?s population, a reduction in available farmland as well as =
competition for agricultural land from biofuels. Advances from =
traditional agricultural areas have been resisted by consumers and =
politicians, and consequently increases in productivity need to come =
from non-traditional areas to ensure that the world?s population has =
access to basic nutrition at an affordable price. The Semantic and =
Natural Language Processing (NLP) community can assist the agricultural =
domain by providing unique insights from data or by providing greater =
clarity to current agricultural processes.

Agricultural researchers, in common with other domains, have access to =
large collections of agricultural documents such as scientific papers, =
news, social media data, etc. These textual documents can be analyzed =
and processed with NLP methods, supported by semantic knowledge, to =
resolve agricultural issues in digital agriculture.

To date, the application of text mining and semantics in the =
agricultural domain remains under-explored. This Research Topic invites =
original research, surveys, and position papers that address issues in =
Agricultural Text Mining or Agri Semantics, in order to increase the =
visibility and application potential of this important and emerging =
research area. The scope of this article collection is broad and seeks =
submissions on, but not limited to:
- novel agricultural NLP methods
- multilingual agricultural text mining
- agricultural information retrieval
- agricultural information extraction
- agricultural named entity recognition and disambiguation
- agricultural text visualization
- NLP agricultural applications
- societal impacts of agricultural text mining, language resources, and =
datasets
- agricultural web crawling
- novel agrisemantic resources
- bias or gaps in existing agrisemantic resources
- agrisemantic data integration
- novel argisemantic backed agricultural applications
- and agribusiness industry case studies
