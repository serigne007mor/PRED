Call for Demos
Due by June 27, 2014

We invites proposals for demonstrations to be displayed at the Demo Session=
 that will be organized during the ICDM 2014 conference. Demos of data mini=
ng software that incorporate state-of-the-art techniques, provide an innova=
tive user interface, and/or allow for fluent interaction with the user are =
highly encouraged. Demonstrated software is not required to be ready for co=
mmercial application, as long as it is of interest to the ICDM community. A=
 demo is for:

demonstrating data mining software systems and libraries closely related to=
 the area of data mining and knowledge discovery;
showing new technological advances in applying data mining techniques.
The demo proposal needs to describe:

the motivation for the demonstrated concepts;
the design;
the development and functionality of the work in an interactive setting;
the significance of the contribution.
The ICDM 2014 Demo Session will provide data mining researchers and practit=
ioners an exciting and highly interactive way to explore new ideas and resu=
lts. Accepted demo papers will be published in the ICDM 2014 Workshop Proce=
edings.

Preparing Your Demo Submissions

The demonstration submissions must be within four pages in IEEE proceedings=
 style (double-column pages) and must include:

Title
Authors (name, affiliation, email, address, phone and fax)
Corresponding author with her/his email address
Abstract (max. 150 words)
Keywords
Category of the submission
URL for the demo software (if available)
Equipment you will bring (e.g. laptop, projector)
Equipment you will need (e.g. table, poster board, power sockets)
Special requirements (e.g. extra space and if so how much, video projector)
Discussion of the present state of your demo (e.g. ready to demonstrate now=
, but if not, include a realistic estimate for conclusion and what remains =
to be done before you have a demonstrable system)
Submit your document by the deadline to http://icdm2014.sfu.ca/submission.h=
tml
Selection Criteria

Relevance to the ICDM community
Novelty of the application domain
Technical advances and challenges
Quality and soundness of the underlying technology
Potential for public interaction
Overall attractiveness of the demonstrated system
Important Dates

All deadlines are at 11:59PM Pacific Time.

Demo submission deadline: June 27, 2014
Demo notification: September 24, 2014
