The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to r=
epresent,
share and process information in various forms, ranging from signal, image,=
 and multimedia data to traditional structured data and semi-structured dat=
a found in the web.

SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that increasingly play a key=
 role in connecting systems across network centric environments to allow di=
stributed computing and information sharing.

SITIS 2011 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on resear=
ch activities centered on two main tracks:

    - The focus of the first track "Internet-Based Computing and Systems" (=
IBCS) focuses on emerging and novel concepts, architectures and methodologi=
es for information management. The Internet and the related technologies ha=
ve created an interconnected world in which information can be exchanged ea=
sily, tasks can be processed collaboratively, communities of users with sim=
ilarly interests can be formed to achieve efficiency and improve performanc=
e.
    - The second track titled "Signal & Image Technologies" (SIT) focuses o=
n recent developments in digital signal processing and pays particular atte=
ntion to evolutions in audiovisual signal processing, analysis, coding and =
authentication, and retrieval techniques.

Submission and publication
--------------------------

The conference will include keynote addresses, tutorials, and regular and w=
orkshop sessions. SITIS 2011 invites submission of high quality and origina=
l papers on the topics of the major tracks described below.   All submitted=
 papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for technical merit=
, originality, significance and relevance to track topics.

Papers must be up to 8 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication for=
mat. Accepted papers will be included in the   conference proceedings and p=
ublished by IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major =
indexes.
