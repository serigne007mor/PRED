Subject: [liste-egc] Postdoctoral position in Data Science (DUKe, LINA,
 Univ. Nantes) - February 2015 - 24 months

Postdoctoral position in Nantes, France:
-----------------------------------
Discovery of frequent patterns in complex data (Text, ontology) 
augmented by semantic models.


Context: Antimoine project ( ANR CONTINT )
------------------------------------------
ANTIMOINE (ANthropologie des TerrItoires â€“ lecture du patriMOINE)
is a projet in digital humanities concerned with designing a smart 
environment
to improve access and consultation of an information system about 
heritage objects.
ANTIMOINE project tackles with the cooperation of three different semantic
models associated to scientific challenges:
- meaning through linguistic analysis,
- meaning through data analysis,
- meaning through action analysis.


Job specification:
------------------
The candidate will address the 2nd challenge "meaning through data 
analysis",
by studying the available data to extract frequent patterns in relation 
with
the 2 additional models (linguistic, action).
More specifically her/his task will consist in :
- making a survey of the literature,
- preprocessing the textual data (POS-tagging)
- discovering (generalized) frequent patterns and (generalized) 
association rules
- improving the discovery by coupling information from the 2 additional 
models: semantic from linguistic model, and usage from action model.
- participating to project management : task, deliveries, etc.

Your Profile
------------
You hold (or very soon receive) a PhD degree in Computer Science.
You have strong scientific skills in :
- frequent pattern analysis and clustering (models and tools),
- programming (java, C, Python...),
and good knowledge in one or several of the following topics:
- text-mining (POS-tagging),
- ontology engineering (OWL, SPARQL), databases (sql), sequence mining.

In complement, the candidate should :
- demonstrate fluent written English skills;
- have research and publication skills (paper writting);
- understand french (speaking)

Our offer
---------
This is a full-time position of a PostDoctoral researcher.
Starting date: February 2014.
Duration: 2 years (24 months).
The position will be held in the DUKe team of the LINA lab,
located in Polytech Nantes graduate school of engineers (France),
which is specialized in data science,
in a context of multidisciplinary collaboration with 2 partners and a 
company.
