2nd CALL FOR PAPERS
___________________________________________________________________________

QIMIE 2015, 4th *Workshop on Quality Issues, Measures of Interestingness=20
and Evaluation of data mining models* @PAKDD 2015, May 19-22, Ho Chi=20
Minh City, Viet Nam).

*A special issue in the Vietnam Journal of Computer Science* (VJCS,=20
Springer) is planned.

*Workshop paper submission deadline*: 16 March 2015


Workshop site: https://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/qimie2015/

_Workshop Overview_:
The main themes of QIMIE'15 will focus on the theory, the techniques and=20
the practices that can ensure the discovered knowledge is of quality. It=20
will thus cover the problem of measuring quality of patterns, the=20
evaluation of data mining models and the links between the discovery=20
stage and the quality assessment stage. If you are interested by these=20
problems, we invite you to submit a paper to QIMIE'15 and to the Vietnam=20
Journal of Computer Science special issue.

_Major topics will include but are not limited to the following_:

  * objective measures of interest (for individual rules or rules basis,
    patterns, graph, data streams, clusters, etc.)
  * subjective measures of interest and quality based on human
    knowledge, quality of ontologies, actionable rules
  * algorithmic properties of measures of interest especially in the
    context of big data
  * comparison of algorithms: issues with benchmarks, experiments and
    parameters tuning questioning also reproducibility of data mining
    results, the need of new data sets which match new problems,
    methodologies, statistical tests, etc.
  * robustness evaluation and statistical evaluation
  * graphical tools like ROC, cost curves, user-friendly visualizations
    tools
  * special issues: imbalanced data, very large data set, very high
    dimensional data, changing environments and dynamic data, data
    streams, big data, lack of training data, graph data, annotated data
    and semi-supervised learning, methods for performance evaluation
    with no ground truth data, etc.
  * special issues in specialized domains: bioinformatics, security,
    information retrieval, sequential and times series data, social
    networks, geo-localized data, etc.


_Important dates and deadlines_:
- Workshop paper submission deadline: 16 March 2015
- Workshop author notification: 1 April 2015
- Workshop camera-ready due & registration: TBA
- Workshop date: 19 May 2015


_Publication_:
- accepted papers will be published in QIMIE'15 Proceedings
- outstanding papers will be published in *LNCS/LNAI Post Proceedings*=20
of PAKDD Workshops
- in addition, selected and revised papers of QIMIE'15 will be=20
considered for a *special issue of the Vietnam Journal of Computer=20
Science* (VJCS, Springer), associated with the QIMIE workshop. The VJCS=20
has established the first step to be an international and prestigious=20
journal in the field of Computer Science.
