[Apologies if you got multiple copies of this invitation]


The 12th International ACM Conference on Management of Digital =
EcoSystems (MEDES'20)=20
In-Cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
http://medes.sigappfr.org/20/ <http://medes.sigappfr.org/20/>
November 2nd - 4th, 2020
Abu Dhabi, UAE=20


COVID-19 Announcement
Due to safety and public health concerns, and in order to adapt to the =
newly instated safety measures we announce the following:
1. The submission deadline for MEDES 2020 has been extended by a month =
(new deadline: July 15th 2020).
2. During the conference, authors will be able to present their work via =
skype/video-conference (in case they do not wish to travel).
We wish you health and safety during these tough times.


Description and Objectives

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and =
exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of =
intelligent environments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the =
web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as =
individuals, organisations, services, software and applications sharing =
one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and =
inter-relationships among them. With the help of the computational =
intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties =
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) =
environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital =
components", in which resources provided by each entity are properly =
conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly =
comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* =
properties platforms. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital =
ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads =
to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower =
digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The =
application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the =
understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact =
to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and =
knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, =
models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web =
technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, =
artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organising systems to =
support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their =
resources. The International Conference on Management of Digital =
EcoSystems (MEDES),previously named "The International Conference on =
Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems", aims to develop and bring =
together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and =
industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues =
related to resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current =
approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end. =
MEDES 2018 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results =
or novel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems. At the same =
time, the conference calls for short papers presenting interesting and =
exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not =
quite ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.

Paper Submission

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be =
uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at =
most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with =
length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at =
least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary notification date, authors =
rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiries and their =
comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with =
the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, =
significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of =
presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong =
or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital =
Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present =
the paper. The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and =
indexed by the ACM Digital Library and DBLP. Kindly submit your papers =
by clicking https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020>.

Poster Submission

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to present =
early-stage or ongoing research, and to receive valuable feedback from =
conference attendees. We also strongly encourage student and industry =
submissions. Topics of interest are the same as those listed in the main =
conference and special session call for papers. A Best Poster Award will =
be assigned by an independent review committee according to the quality =
of research work and the quality of poster presentation. Authors are =
required to submit a short paper describing the poster content. =
Specifically, this paper should clearly state: (a) the research problem =
being addressed including the current state of the art, (b) what makes =
this problem relevant, important, and challenging, (c) the approach to =
the problem, (d) the key contribution, and (e) the expected results. =
Submitted papers must present original unpublished research that is not =
currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts =
should be prepared in 10-point font using the 2-column ACM conference =
format https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template =
<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template> and may not =
exceed 2 pages, including figures tables (references may extend beyond =
this limit up to 1 more page). All papers should be written in English =
and submitted electronically in PDF format via the submission site =
posted on this page. Notice that authors do not submit the poster, but =
only the short paper describing in text what the poster would present. =
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by a technical program committee and =
will be judged based on their novelty, relevance, technical strength as =
well as the potential to generate discussions. Papers not following =
these guidelines may be rejected without review. Also, submissions =
received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not =
appropriately structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact =
the program chairs for further information or clarification. Papers =
should be submitted electronically by the deadline to =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmedes2020>. All accepted =
papers will appear in the conference proceedings. At least one of the =
authors of every accepted poster must register at the conference and =
present the poster at the poster session. The recommended poster size is =
A0 (33.1 x 46.8 in, portrait orientation). The conference does not =
provide any support for printing posters. Typically, authors print their =
posters ahead of the conference.

Special Issue

Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their =
work to appear in the Internet of Things Journal.
