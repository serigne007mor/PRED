*************************************************************************
Call for Special Sessions Track

10th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (=
DSAA 2023)
October 9-13, 2023
Thessaloniki, Greece
https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/

*************************************************************************

** ABOUT DSAA SPECIAL SESSIONS TRACK **
DSAA Special Sessions are an important part of the main conference program.=
 They bring together researchers, industry experts, practitioners, and pote=
ntial users who are interested in cultivating specialized and important asp=
ects of data science and analytics.

DSAA Special Sessions are intended to promote emerging data science researc=
h areas that are not well established and covered in the main conference tr=
acks, while featuring high quality papers, which would normally appear in t=
he main track. The same evaluation criteria and quality level apply as for =
the main conference, but the papers must adhere to the area of the special =
session they are submitted to, and the reviewers are experts in that area.

We welcome proposals that promote a more intensive interaction between diff=
erent communities and proposals that promote cooperation to solve interdisc=
iplinary problems. Thus, special sessions might focus on:

1- Topics on the border of data science research area
2- Advanced topics within the data science research area
3- Specific application areas for data science

** IMPORTANT DATES **
-Special Session Proposal Due: February 27, 2023
-Special Session Proposal Notification: March 6, 2023
-Special Session Paper Submission Deadline: June 1, 2023 (tentative)
-Special Session Paper Notification: August 20, 2023 (tentative)
-Camera ready: submission September 6, 2023 (tentative)

** SPECIAL SESSION PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND REVIEW **
Proposals for hosting special sessions at DSAA 2023 are welcome. The propos=
als must address:

1- Title: Propose a title of the special session.
2- Abstract: Introduce a brief abstract of no more than approximately 100 w=
ords that allows conference attendees to understand the topic and the focus=
 of the special session.
3- Aims and Scope
4- Rationale: Please explain why the topic of the special session is novel =
and timely, why it is relevant to the DSAA community.
5- Related special sessions previously organized (with number of papers rec=
eived/accepted)
6- Organizers: Provide a list of organizers with their affiliations, short =
bio, and contacts and confirm you agree that this information will appear o=
n the conference website.
7- Potential Committee Members

 short biographical sketch, describing relevant qualifications and experien=
ce; identify at least one organizer as the contact person.
For (5), list any special session or relevant events (e.g., workshops) the =
organizers have organized in recent years in DSAA or other major conference=
s; for each, list the year, the conference, number of submissions, number o=
f papers accepted, number of participants, etc.
For (7), give a list of qualified committee members who would be invited.
Special session proposals will be reviewed based on the above criteria and =
quality of the proposals as well as their relationship to the main conferen=
ce topics. Preference may be given to timely topics that are critical for d=
ata science and analytics, inspire highly interactive discussions, and show=
case the impact of data science and analytics.
Proposers are encouraged to give an estimation of the number of submissions=
 they expect.

** SUBMISSION OF A SPECIAL SESSION **
All proposals should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: https://eas=
ychair.org/my/conference?conf=3Ddsaa2023 (under the =E2=80=9CSpecial Sessio=
ns=E2=80=9D Track)

** SPECIAL SESSION ORGANIZATION, PAPER SUBMISSION AND REVIEW **
Once a special session proposal has been accepted, its organizers should cr=
eate a website with the Special Session information and should widely publi=
cize the session=E2=80=99s call for papers on different mailing lists and s=
ocial media.
Special session papers strictly follow the same specifications, requirement=
s, and policies as the main conference submissions in terms of the paper su=
bmission deadline, notification deadline, paper formatting and length, and =
important policies. Special session paper submissions will be done via Easy=
Chair.
Reviewing the submissions in each special session is coordinated by the spe=
cial session organizers and is fully aligned to the main conference evaluat=
ion process. In particular:

-All papers submitted to special sessions will be double-blind reviewed.
-Organizers of each special session will select the program committee membe=
rs (PCMs).
-PCMs will be invited by the Special Session Chairs into the submission sys=
tem for each Special Session; a reviewer can serve as PCM in more than one =
Special Session.
-Papers will then be assigned to appropriate PCMs by the Special Session or=
ganizers for review.
-Special Session organizers will make recommendations of acceptance/rejecti=
on for papers in their sessions, which must be validated by the Special Ses=
sion Chairs.

To guarantee uniform quality control for all special sessions and to be con=
sistent with the main conference, the final decisions of special session pa=
per acceptance/rejection are made by the DSAA Program Chairs.

** PROCEEDINGS, INDEXING AND SPECIAL ISSUES **
All accepted full-length special session papers will be published by IEEE i=
n the DSAA main conference proceedings under its Special Session scheme. Al=
l papers will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEEXplore Digital Library.
Organizers of Special Sessions may additionally, arrange for special issues=
 to further publish the extended journal versions of the papers. Several pa=
st special sessions have published special issues with the International Jo=
urnal of Data Science and Analytics (JDSA, Springer).

** GENERAL INQUIRIES **
Inquiries about special session proposals should be sent directly to the Sp=
ecial Session Chairs (please see contact information below).
Specific inquiries about a Special Session should be submitted to the sessi=
on organizers, who are advised to set up a joint email address, once their =
proposal is accepted.

** SPECIAL SESSIONS CHAIRS **
-Vagelis Papalexakis, University of California Riverside (epapalex at cs do=
t ucr dot edu)
-Grant Scott, University of Missouri (scottgs at missouri dot edu)
