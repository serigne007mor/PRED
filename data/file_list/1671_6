The topic of this special issue concerns the design and the development
of novel and modern Web applications based on easy to accomplish
end-user composition of services. Combining Web service technologies
(WSDL, UDDI, SOAP) with fresh content, collaborative approaches (e.g.,
Web 2.0), and possibly including semantic technologies (RSS, RDFa,
SPARQL ) is an exciting challenge for both, academic and industrial
researchers.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This special issue seeks original articles on service mashups in the
context of service oriented (Web services) applications. The Internet
and the related technologies have created an interconnected world in
which information can be exchanged easily, tasks can be processed
collaboratively, communities of users with similar interests can be
formed to achieve efficiency and improve performance. In this context,
service mashups which is an information sharing and aggregation to
support content publishing for new modern Web application become an
important issue. New technologies were recently developed to provide
powerful ways to represent fresh contents such as Really Simple
Syndication (RSS), microformats, RDFa, and possibly including semantic
technology standards (e.g., RDF, RDFS, OWL, SWRL, and SPARQL). Web
services are also nowadays emerging as a major technology for deploying
automated interactions between distributed and heterogeneous
applications. Various standards support this deployment including WSDL,
UDDI, and SOAP. These standards respectively support the definition of
Web services, their advertisement to the community of potential users,
and finally their binding for invocation purposes.<br>
<br>
Papers describing advanced research and experience on service mashups
based on Web services technologies are being solicited. This special
issue will include, but is not limited to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mashups examples and experience (design, architecture,=
 implementation, usability and user-experience)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - (Dynamic) Languages, frameworks, and (runtime)
platforms for the design, implementation, testing and maintenance of
Web APIs and services mashups<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Analysis of and experience with services mashups
(creation, deployment, and usage) from social and economical
perspectives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Web 2.0 based mashups&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Case studies on service-based semantic mashups<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Quality of services mashups: reliability, security, an=
d other non-functional aspects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Data Integration for the service mashups <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Service mediation for the Semantic Web application <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Web 2.0, semantics and service-oriented architecture (=
SOA)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mashups in mobile applications<br>
