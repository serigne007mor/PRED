AIMLAI@CIKM2022: International Workshop on Advances in Interpretable Machin=
e Learning and Artificial Intelligence=20

We invite researchers working on interpretability and explainability in ML/=
AI, and related topics, to submit regular (8 pages, single column) or short=
 (3 pages, single column) papers to the AIMLAI workshop that will be held a=
t CIKM 2022.=20
Website: https://project.inria.fr/aimlai/=20
Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daimlaicikm22=20
Submission deadline: August 15, 2022=20

The purpose of AIMLAI (Advances in Interpretable Machine Learning and Artif=
icial Intelligence) is to encourage principled research that will lead to t=
he advancement of explainable, transparent, ethical and fair data mining, m=
achine learning, and artificial intelligence. AIMLAI is a workshop that see=
ks top-quality submissions addressing uncovered important issues related to=
 explainable and interpretable data mining and machine learning models. Pap=
ers should present novel research results in any of the topics of interest =
for the workshop as well as application experiences, tools and promising pr=
eliminary ideas. AIMLAI asks for contributions from researchers, academia a=
nd industry, working on topics addressing these challenges primarily from a=
 technical point of view, but also from a legal, ethical or sociological pe=
rspective. Besides the central topic of interpretable algorithms and explan=
ation methods, we also welcome submissions that answer research questions l=
ike "how to measure and evaluate interpretability and explainability?" and =
"how to integrate humans in the machine learning pipeline for interpretabil=
ity purposes?". This year's edition of AIMLAI is open to two kinds of submi=
ssions: regular papers (6 pages, double column) and extended abstracts (2 p=
ages, double column).=20

A non-exhaustive list of topics that are of interest for AIMLAI are the fol=
lowing:=20
* Interpretable ML=20
* Supervised and Unsupervised ML=20
* Explaining recommendation models=20
* Multimodal explanations=20
* Transparency in AI and ML=20
* Ethical aspects=20
* Legal aspects=20
* Fairness issues=20
* Methodology and formalization of interpretability=20
* Formal measures of interpretability=20
* Interpretability/complexity trade-offs=20
* How to evaluate interpretability=20
* User-centric interpretability=20
* Explanation modules=20
* Interpretability and Semantics: how to add semantics to explanations?=20
* Human-in-the-loop to construct and/or evaluate interpretable models=20
* Integration of ML algorithms, infovis and man-machine interfaces=20

- Submission Guidelines=20
Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the ACM sigcon=
f template. Regular papers must be 6 pages long maximum. Extended abstracts=
 are restricted to a maximum of 2 pages. Overlength papers will be rejected=
 without review (papers with smaller page margins and font sizes than speci=
fied in the author instructions and set in the style files will also be tre=
ated as overlength).=20
Authors who submit their work to AIMLAI 2022 commit themselves to present t=
heir paper at the workshop in case of acceptance. AIMLAI 2022 considers the=
 author list submitted with the paper as final. No additions or deletions t=
o this list may be made after paper submission, either during the review pe=
riod, or in case of acceptance, at the final camera ready stage.=20
Condition for inclusion in the post-proceedings is that at least one of the=
 co-authors has (in-person or virtually) presented the paper at the worksho=
p.=20
All papers for AIMLAI 2022 must be submitted by using the online submission=
 system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daimlaicikm22.=20
