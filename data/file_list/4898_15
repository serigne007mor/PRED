Subject: [liste-egc] PhD in Interpretable Models

We are looking for a motivated candidate for a PhD program in  
Artificial Intelligence at the Sorbonne University, Paris.

The title: Interpretable Models (for Medical Applications): a Marriage  
between Machine Learning and Decision Theory

If you are interested, please contact (before June, 15): Patrice Perny  
patrice.perny@lip6.fr; Nataliya Sokolovska  
nataliya.sokolovska@sorbonne-universite.fr

In this thesis, we would like to take the best of two worlds, machine  
learning and decision theory, both actively developed in Artificial  
Intelligence, to propose adaptive and interpretable evaluation models  
and contribute to produce reliable medical scoring systems which can  
be integrated into hospital routines.

An ideal candidate is expected to have a Master 2 in Computer Science  
(preferably in AI or Mathematics or Operations Research) or an  
equivalent engineering degree. A background in Machine Learning,  
optimization, and decision theory or any related field will be  
appreciated. An ideal candidate will propose, develop, and test  
numerically the developed methods. It is expected that the candidate  
provides some theoretical foundations for the methods and also  
implements them in R/Matlab/Python, and the final product will be  
publicly available. A candidate is supposed to have an interest in  
biology/medicine.

Expertise and Supervision. To provide expertise and supervision in  
decision theory and machine learning and medicine or biology, the PhD  
thesis will be jointly supervised by Patrice Perny and Nataliya  
Sokolovska. Moreover, a tight collaboration with clinicians of the  
NutriOmics team, Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital is planned.
