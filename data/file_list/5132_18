TOPIC SUMMARY:

The recent progress of methodologies and technologies in the fields of Big
Data Analytics, from one side, and Machine/Deep Learning, from another
side, has given a new impulse to research on complex real-world behaviors
and phenomena, which can be conveniently modeled as feature-rich networks.
Such networks are designed to take the expressive power of graph data
models of different types (e.g., Heterogeneous information networks,
Multilayer networks, Temporal networks, Location-aware networks,
Probabilistic networks) to a higher level whereby the contextual
information of a target domain-specific environment are embedded into the
network.

The aim of this Research Topic, titled =E2=80=9CDigging into Feature-Rich N=
etworks:
unveiling connections in Big Data=E2=80=9D, is to address challenging issue=
s and
emerging trends at the convergence of Network Science with Big Data
Analytics and Machine/Deep Learning. The idea is to encourage the
development of novel approaches based on advanced big data techniques and
learning paradigms, that will enhance our understanding of complex
phenomena in information networks. Moreover, we also aim to promote
visionary works about alternative approaches for complex network analysis.

These include not only long studied contexts such as social media and
biological networks, but also less investigated or even new frontiers for
network science, such as finance, engineering, archaeology, geology,
astronomy, and many others. Although the use of feature-rich networks can
intuitively be perceived as beneficial for most research tasks based on
graph data, their expressive power has not been yet fully valued in most
domains. Therefore, there is an emergence for providing insights into how
the study of complex network models can pave the way for solving
domain-specific problems that might not be adequately addressed by existing
graph models.

Within this view, we solicit contributions on advanced modeling and mining
of feature-rich networks, regarding any data domain, including both
theoretical and application-oriented studies.

The topics of interest for this special issue include, but are not limited
to:

=E2=80=A2 Foundations of Learning and Mining in feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Simplification/pruning/sampling of feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Embedding and Deep Learning in feature-rich networks

=E2=80=A2 Vertex similarity in multiplex and feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Community Detection in feature-rich networks

=E2=80=A2 User Behavior Modeling in feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Influence propagation in feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Reputation and Trust computing in feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Probabilistic and Uncertain feature-rich networks
=E2=80=A2 Time-evolving feature-rich networks
