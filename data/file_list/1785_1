K-CAP'2007 Workshop on Knowledge Management and Semantic Web for
Engineering Design
28th October 2007
Whistler, British Columbia, Canada
http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/WORKSHOPS/KW4ED-KCAP2007/index.html

Call for Papers

Knowledge management becomes an important issue to "Small to Medium
Entreprises" (SMEs) since most part of the industrial engineering
innovations come from practical expertise in SMEs. The knowledge is
partly implicit and not formalised as in major companies where
production standards (norms, protocols, etc.) are very well established.
In order to capture engineer' skills, and to ease their industrial
design process, support may be given by knowledge management techniques.

The task consists of capturing explicit and tacit knowledge of an SME in
terms of access, sharing, and reuse of that knowledge as well as
creation of new knowledge and organisational learning. All the process
management must be transparent and generic enough to be used by
different user profiles of SME organisational departments: design
engineering, but also management, sales, production, etc. Underlying
techniques should deal with heterogeneous resources: including
documents, CAD drawings, relational databases, data warehouses, 3D
views, and virtual reality motion scenes.

FP6 European co-funded STREP project SevenPro (Semantic Virtual
Engineering Environment for Product Design) aims at addressing this
issue. The ongoing SevenPro project develops technologies and tools
supporting deep mining of product engineering knowledge from multimedia
repositories and enabling semantically enhanced 3D virtual reality (VR)
interaction with product knowledge in integrated engineering
environments. It combines both knowledge management and semantic web
approach based on semantic annotations of design memory.

This workshop is organised by the Sevenpro consortium, in order to
gather active research and industrial actors in the domain of design
engineering, in knowledge management, in semantic web, in data mining
and knowledge discovery in order to discuss all the issues linked to
combination of knowledge management and semantic web for management of
knowledge resources handled in engineering design.

Papers are welcome in any area related to one of the following questions
(not exhaustive):

* How to build and use an ontology useful for engineering?
* How to build a semantically annotated and semantically accessible
project memory?
* How to annotate semantically a design memory: textual documents,
multimedia documents, CAD drawing, virtual reality objects?
* How to browse and use an heterogeneous semantic design memory?
* How to extract information and retrieval from a design memory?
* How to mine a design memory?
* How to discover design patters from a design memory?
* How to integrate semantic descriptions and virtual reality?
* How to reason about a design memory?
* How to offer semantic web services for engineering design?
* How to compare knowledge management approaches used in major companies
and in SMEs?
* How to support cooperation among a designers' team intra or inter SMEs?
* How to support skills management in engineering design?
* How to support a community of designers?
* How to combine standards used in design to those used in semantic Web?

The workshop will be organized in three parts:

* Selected papers submitted to the program committee;
* A number of invited talks (for example, speakers from other relevant
projects studying similar subjects);
* A panel discussion with participants.

This session will foster the exchange of ideas, discussions, clustering,
or collaborations.

The workshop will be held on the 28th October 2007 at The Fairmont
Chateau Whistler. The main conference will be held on the 29th to the
31st of October 2007.
