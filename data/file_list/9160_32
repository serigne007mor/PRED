Subject: [liste-egc] K-CAP 2015: Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals


********************************************************
Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals
at the 8th International Conference on Knowledge Capture
K-CAP 2015
http://www.k-cap2015.org/
********************************************************

Introduction
------------
The International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP) provides a forum that brings together members of diverse research communities who are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a vast range of sources, including human sources (such as experts, crowds and social contexts), and in creating representations that can be useful for building knowledge-intensive services in a variety of fields, such as the semantic web, knowledge management, e-business, natural language processing, intelligent information integration, and so on.

The 8th edition of K-CAP will host a number of workshops and tutorials on topics related to the theme of the conference.

K-CAP workshops provide an informal setting where participants have the opportunity to discuss specific technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active exchange of ideas. Our aim for the workshop program is to promote and collect multidisciplinary research directions that contribute to knowledge capture from a variety of sources.

K-CAP tutorials enable attendees to fully appreciate current issues, main schools of thought, and possible application areas.

Topics of Interest
------------------
We encourage the submission of workshop and tutorial proposals on all topics that fall in the general scope of K-CAP 2015, from traditional knowledge acquisition techniques to more computational approaches:

* Knowledge Acquisition / Capture
* Knowledge Extraction from Text
* Knowledge Extraction from Structured Sources
* Knowledge Authoring
* Knowledge Discovery
* Knowledge Graph Construction (Curated, Automatic or Hybrid)
* Human Computation for Knowledge Capture
* Ontologies and Knowledge Capture
* Machine Reading
* Knowledge Capture and the Semantic Web/Web of Linked Data
* Knowledge Management
* Knowledge Publication
* Collaborative and Social Approaches to Knowledge
* Crowdsourcing for Knowledge Capture and Refinement
* Knowledge Capture from Social Environments and Contexts
* Mixed-Initiative Planning and Decision-Support
* Problem-solving Knowledge and Methods
* Knowledge-Based Markup Techniques
* Knowledge Engineering and Modelling Methodologies
* Narrative Intelligence
* Knowledge Capture through Storytelling
* Learning by Reading
* Provenance and Trust Issues in Knowledge Intensive Systems

Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Workshop and tutorial proposals should be submitted via email to rgarcia@fi.upm.es as a single PDF file of no more than 5 pages, specifying "Workshop Proposal" or "Tutorial Proposal", and should contain the following information.

Workshop proposals:

- Title.
- Abstract (200 words).
- Motivation on why the topic is of particular interest at this time and its relation to the main conference topics.
- Workshop format, discussing the mix of events such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, and general discussion.
- Intended audience and expected number of participants.
- List of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have to be confirmed at the time of the proposal).
- Indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day.
- Past versions of the workshop, including URLs as well as submission and acceptance counts.
- Data of the organizers (name, affiliation, email address, homepage) and short CV.

Additionally
- We strongly advise having more than one organizer, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.
- We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.

Tutorial proposals:

- Title.
- Abstract (200 words).
- Motivation on why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
- Relation to the conference topics.
- If the tutorial, or a very similar tutorial, has been given elsewhere, explanation of the benefit of presenting it again to the K-CAP community.
- Overview of content, description of the aims, presentation style, potential/preferred prerequisite knowledge.
- Indication on whether the tutorial should be considered for a half-day or full-day.
- Intended audience and expected number of participants.
- Audio-visual or technical requirements and any special room requirements (for hands-on sessions, any software needed and download sites must be provided by the tutorial presenters).
- Data of the presenters (name, affiliation, email address, homepage) and short CV including also their expertise, experiences in teaching and in tutorial presentation.

Additionally, tutorials should satisfy the following criteria:

- There is a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application, and
- There is a sufficiently large community interested in the topic.

Workshop Organizers Responsibilities

- Be responsible for publishing electronic proceedings (e.g., on the CEUR-WS website)
- Ensure workshop participants are informed they have to register to the main conference and the workshop
- Producing a single printable PDF with workshop material to allow possibly printing of workshop proceedings
- Schedule, attend and coordinate their entire workshop

Tutorial Organizers Responsibilities
------------------------------------
The proposers of accepted tutorials are expected to prepare a tutorial webpage (linked to the official K-CAP website) containing detailed information about the tutorial, and to distribute material to participants.
