Subject: [liste-egc] Less than a week left -- Final CfP for Machine Learning
 and Data Mining for Sports Analytics 2021 (MLSA21) co-located with
 ECML/PKDD 2021

*Scope of the workshop*
=C2=A0
Sports Analytics has been a steadily growing and rapidly evolving area ove=
r the last decade both in US professional sports leagues and in European fo=
otball leagues=2E The recent implementation of strict financial fair-play r=
egulations in European football will definitely increase the importance of =
Sports Analytics in the coming years=2E In addition, there is of course the=
 popularity of sports betting=2E The developed approaches are being used fo=
r decision support in all aspects of professional sports, including:
- Analyzing positional data (tracking data)
- Match strategy, tactics, and analysis
- Player acquisition, player valuation, and team spending
- Training regimens and focus
- Injury prediction and prevention
- Performance management and prediction
- Match outcome and league table prediction
- Tournament design and scheduling
- Betting odds calculation
=C2=A0
Traditionally, the definition of sports has also included certain non-phys=
ical activities, such as chess =E2=80=93 in other words, games=2E Especiall=
y in the last decade, so-called e-sports, based on a number of computer gam=
es, have become very relevant commercially=2E Professional teams have been =
formed for games such as Starcraft 2, Defense of the Ancients (DOTA) 2, and=
 League of Legends=2E Moreover, tournaments offer large sums of prize money=
 and are important broadcast events=2E Given that topics such as strategy a=
nalysis and match forecasting apply in equal measure to these new sports (a=
nd other topics might apply as well but are not very well explored so far),=
 and data collection is in fact somewhat easier than for off-line sports, w=
e have chosen to broaden the scope of the workshop and solicit e-sports sub=
missions as well=2E
=C2=A0
The majority of techniques used in the field so far are statistical=2E How=
ever, there has been growing interest in the Machine Learning and Data Mini=
ng community about this topic=2E Build- ing off our successful workshops on=
 Sports Analytics at ECML/PKDD 2013, ECML/PKDD 2015 through ECML/PKDD 2020 =
we wish to continue to grow this interest by hosting a eigth edition at ECM=
L/PKDD 2021=2E We think that the setting is interesting and challenging, an=
d can potentially be a source of new data=2E Furthermore, we believe that t=
his offers a great opportunity to bring people from outside of the Machine =
Learning community into contact with typical ECML/PKDD contributors as well=
 as to highlight what the community has done and can do in the field of Spo=
rts Analytics=2E
=C2=A0
*Submissions*
The workshop solicits papers covering both predictive and descriptive Mach=
ine Learning, Data Mining, and related approaches to Sports Analytics setti=
ngs, including, but not limited to, the list of topics above=2E Adopting a =
broad definition of sports, the workshop is also open to submissions on ele=
ctronic sports (i=2Ee=2E, e-sports) that are related to any of these topics=
=2E The following types of papers can be submitted:
- Long papers will be 9 pages of content and an unlimited number of refere=
nces in the Springer LNCS style and should report on novel, unpublished wor=
k that might not be quite mature enough for a conference or journal submiss=
ion=2E
- Extended abstracts will be 2 pages in Springer LNCS style and summarize =
recent publications fitting the workshop=2E
=C2=A0
Papers are to be submitted in pdf format at https://easychair=2Eorg/confer=
ences/?conf=3Dmlsa21
=C2=A0
Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committ=
ee on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity=
=2E Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper is accepted =
at least one author should present the paper at the workshop=2E The worksho=
p will include invited talks, a mix of oral and poster presentations for al=
l accepted papers, and a discussion regarding the goals, limits, and desira=
bility of Sports Analytics=2E
=C2=A0
*Key dates*
Paper submission: 23/06/2021
Author notification: 12/07/2021
Camera-ready due: 26/07/2021
