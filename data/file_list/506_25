Call for papers,

Workshop on Natural Language Processing in support of Learning:
Metrics, Feedback and Connectivity
(http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/sciedu/nlpsl/). Held with the 14th Int.
Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------------

Introduction

In AI-ED research, providing feedback for learning entails measuring
differences among learners; between learners and their desired
characteristics (e.g., knowledge, competences, motivation,
self-regulation processes); or between learners and their looked-for
resources (e.g. web-links, articles, courses) has often been performed
by computing and analysing =E2=80=98distances=E2=80=99 using several techni=
ques like
factorial analysis, instance-based learning, clustering, and so on.
Corpora on which these measures are made are all writing-based, that
is, are multiple forms of pieces of evidence such as texts read
(written by teachers), spoken utterances, essays, summaries, forum or
chat messages. Some of these metrics are based on shallow syntactical
and morphological aspects of the interaction and production artefacts
(e.g., text length). Others are focused more on semantic and pragmatic
aspects. These measures are used for providing various kinds of
feedback for supporting learning and connections between learners. For
instance, relations between learners=E2=80=99 utterances, knowledge, concept
acquisition, emotional states, essay scores, and even learners
themselves have all been investigated with the help of computing
semantic distances.

Aims

The purpose of this workshop is to focus on the latter two =E2=80=93 semant=
ics
and pragmatics =E2=80=93 by trying to identify what questions and problems =
are
solved, but also to raise and discuss how well the metrics developed
assist in the provision of support and the construction of feedback
for learning. What are the most efficient ones? To what extent do they
match distances inferred by teachers=E2=80=99 assessments? This workshop
addresses the problem of how support can be provided and feedback be
generated for helping students learn.
Several Natural Language Processing techniques like Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) or the use of semantic and pragmatic analysis of
conversations have been successfully deployed in various educational
applications to enrich learning and teaching with information
technology. However, few research approaches considered also in detail
the problem of providing feedback.

The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together experts in the
related fields in order to:

share knowledge (i.e., approaches, models, issues, solutions) acquired
in the domain of distance semantics, gained within distributed
research about distance-based computing applied to educational
applications (either from the context of the IST projects such as
LTfLL, Cooper, iCamp, TenCompetence, Role, and Prolearn/Stellar, or
from computer and cognitive scientists involved in LSA-based
research).
debate on directions and possibilities of future research in the
domain. - create a forum for further collaboration and develop an
international community on this field of study.
Topics

The topics of this workshop relate on the AI-ED applications of these
techniques and the methodological issues they have raised (e.g., their
selection and validation). A previous workshop with a very close
purpose has been organized two years ago in Heerlen at the Open
University of the Netherlands
(http://dspace.ou.nl/bitstream/1820/933/1/lsatel07___miniproceedings.pdf).

Topics should cover the following distance-based semantic processing
techniques in AI-ED research, but are not restricted to:

Automated essay scoring & grading, Summarization & writing assistance, such=
 as:

Feedback generation, Tutoring & Tutor support, Question answering
Learner modelling, Enriching user profiles, Peer finding & community format=
ion
Positioning & Placement of learners
Selection & Sequencing of content
Protocol analysis, Knowledge gap analysis, Task analysis
Methodological issues of distance-based semantic processing
techniques, such as:

Corpus composition & preparation (sanitising, filtering, selection,
seeding, domain modelling, etc.)
Optimisation of analysis and queries
Statistical properties
Combining these techniques with other ones
Evaluation and Validation concerns
Cognitive Modelling using distance-based semantic processing
techniques, such as:

Knowledge acquisition
Language acquisition and development
Measure of semantic relatedness
Cognitive architectures
Activity modelling
Cognitive corpora
Analysis, assessment and feedback generation of content and
inter-animation in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through
chats, such as:

Content analysis of chat conversations
Discourse analysis and visualization in chat conversations
Identification of discussion and argumentation threads in conversations
Identification of inter-animation, transactivity and interactions in chats
Assessment of learners=E2=80=99 participation in conversations
Feedback generation for chats in educational settings
Call for Papers and Paper Format Requirements=E2=86=91

Submission Types

Submitted papers should describe substantial and unpublished work.
English is the official language for both papers and talks.
Submissions are expected to comply with the AI-ED paper format (Word
users, Latex users). The submitted papers should be 6-8 pages in
length and in PDF format.

Paper Submission Process

All papers will be reviewed using a blind refeering process by at
least two members of the program committee.
=C2=A0Submit a paper at the AIED Workshops Submission Site:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daiedw2009 (Opening soon)
powered by EasyChair (please get an EasyChair account before
submitting and select the appropriate workshop in the list when
submitting. Also note that it is mandatory to use this site to submit
a paper: papers directly submitted through e-mail won't be taken into
account).
Accepted papers will be printed locally for dissemination at the workshop.
Based on the quality of the submissions we are considering publishing
post-workshop proceedings in a special issue of LDV-Forum or CEUR-WS.
Authors will be required to provide expanded versions of their
submissions which will undergo an additional review process for
inclusion in the special issue.
