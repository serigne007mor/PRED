Workshop description

Monitor and manage sanitary risks, study climate change, environmental 
impacts in connexion with agricultural practices (the use of pesticides, 
for example), mapping the good ecological status of rivers, simulate 
spread of forest fires … are environmental and agricultural challenges 
for which Information and Decision Support Systems represent effective 
solutions. New theoretical and technical challenges emerge from the 
integration of several scientific domains such as agronomy, mathematics, 
information technology and computer science. The objective of the 
proposed workshop is to show how the latest advances in research in 
information and decision-support systems can be applied to environmental 
and agricultural matters.
Information and Decision Support Systems topics (include but are not 
limited to):

* Database, Data Warehouses
* Geographic Information Systems
* Cloud/Grid Computing
* Distributed information systems
* Interoperability between information systems
* Data Integration
* Geovisulization Knowledge management
* Spatial Big Data
* Geosensor network
* Software Engineering
* Data Mining, etc.

Application domains (include but are not limited to):

* Agricultural production
* Agricultural traceability and food safety
* Eco-technologies
* Environmental issues in rural and urban areas
* Forest fires
* Global climate change
* Impact assessments of agricultural and industrial activities
* Soil, air and water quality models
* Precision farming
* Risk assessments
* Modeling and simulation for environment and agriculture
* Water management, etc.

Proceedings and Journal special issue

Accepted papers of the Workshops will be included in a Springer-Verlag 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume. Selected papers will be 
invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the Ecological 
Informatics journal (impact factor: 1.432).

Evaluation Policy

Each paper will be independently reviewed by at least 3 program 
committee members. Their individual scores will be evaluated by a small 
sub-committee and result in one of the following final decisions: 
accepted, or accepted on the condition that suggestions for improvement 
will be incorporated, or rejected. Notification of this decision will be 
sent to authors.
Submission Guidelines

Each paper must be original and unpublished work, not submitted for 
publication elsewhere (copyright problems fall entirely under 
responsibility of the authors).

The authors should submit complete papers (max 12 pages). Paper must be 
formatted according to LNCS rules. Please find Latex2e and MSWord 
templates in the LNCS website.

To submit a paper, authors must (see http://deas.irstea.fr/aeidss2013/):

1. Authenticate/Register into the Electronic Submission System
2. Submit an abstract
3. Submit the paper in LNCS format
