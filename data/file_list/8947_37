Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponent=
ial use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environ=
ments namely "digital ecosystems"=20
connected to the web and composed of multiple and independent entities such=
 as individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing=
 one or several missions=20
and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them. With t=
he help of the computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exh=
ibit new self-* properties=20
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments=
, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", i=
n which resources provided=20
by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used.=20
The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, i=
nnovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms.

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly=
 complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to=
 how managing resources=20
will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-cre=
ating.=20
The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the=
 understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to=
 create benefits and added-values,=20
impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be impro=
ved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as b=
ig data management,=20
web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artifi=
cial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the es=
tablishment=20
of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International ACM Conference on Management of computational and collect=
ive IntElligence in Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring to=
gether a diverse=20
community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in e=
xploring the manifold challenges and issues related to resource management =
of Digital Ecosystems=20
and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to t=
his end.

MEDES 2014 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results or n=
ovel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems.=20=20
At the same time, the conference calls  for short papers presenting interes=
ting and exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas=20
that are not quite ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.=20


Topics=20
-------
MEDES 2014 seeks contributions in the following 10 areas:

1. Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
2. Green computing
3. Computational and Collective Intelligence
4. Services
5. Trust, Security & Privacy
6. Data & Knowledge Management
7. Internet of Things and Intelligent Web
8. Human-Computer Interaction
9. Networks and Protocols
10. Open Source=20


Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website.=20
The submitted paper should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Pap=
ers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected.=20

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the p=
reliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all r=
eviewer inquiries and their comments.=20
Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with the final dec=
ision.=20
Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originali=
ty, technical soundness, and quality of presentation.=20
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging pos=
itions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems.=20
At least one author should attend the conference to present the paper.=20

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP.
