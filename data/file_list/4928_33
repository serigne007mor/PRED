Special Issue on Semantic Web for the Global =46ood System=C2=A0

Semantic Web journal=C2=A0
Submission deadline: Nov 30, 2021=C2=A0

http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/call-papers-special-issue-semant=
ic-web-global-food-system=C2=A0


The global food system is comprised of tightly woven and highly=C2=A0
interconnected subsystems, from logistics, ecosystems, geopolitical=C2=A0=

entities, agriculture, economics and the events that impact them, such=C2=
=A0
as climate change or disasters. However, these systems are not stable or=C2=
=A0
uniform, and in times of global climate and health uncertainty,=C2=A0
increasingly difficult to predict. They vary across regions and time,=C2=A0=

and they form complex interaction networks. =46or instance, changing=C2=A0=

cultural norms may require an adjustment of a system even though these=C2=
=A0
may not strictly be optimal from another perspective. Conversely,=C2=A0
society has to adapt to changes in the environment, e.g., to ensure the=C2=
=A0
long-term sustainability of natural resources. Decision-makers also need=C2=
=A0
to account for regional aspects and systemic interactions between=C2=A0
neighboring regions that, to date, are often considered in isolation.=C2=A0=


=46urthermore, the data used to inform these decisions is generated at a=C2=
=A0
pace that no human can ingest, let alone understand. It is too rapid,=C2=A0=

too multivariate, and too interlinked. Alternatively, there can be=C2=A0
disconnected data, either from each other, or from the procedural=C2=A0
knowledge used to generate it. This confusing tangle of data and=C2=A0
processes, coupled with the high volume of each can lead to significant=C2=
=A0
problems and barriers to understanding the current state of the art -=C2=A0=

and the world.=C2=A0

This call aims to address how Semantic Web and knowledge graph=C2=A0
technologies can be - or are - used to facilitate the improvement of=C2=A0=

global food systems, from decision- and policy-making, to data-informed=C2=
=A0
agricultural practices, and the integration of highly heterogeneous=C2=A0=

sensor data.=C2=A0
