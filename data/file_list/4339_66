CALL FOR PAPERS
*DOING 2020: International Workshop on Intelligent Data – From Data to 
Knowledge*

August 25th, 2020
Lyon, France
*In conjunction with ADBIS, TPDL & EDA joint conferences*

http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/doing/?page_id=77
**************************************************************************

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission:        March 30, 2020
Paper submission:           April 4, 2020
Notification of acceptance: May 5, 2020


SUBMISSIONS

DOING workshop accepts short (limited to 6 pages) or long (limited to
12 pages) papers. DOING reserves the right to accept only as short
papers those papers describing interesting and innovative ideas which
still require further technical development. Papers should be written
in English, formatted in Latex and present substantially original
results.

Accepted papers will be published in the Springer CCIS series and the
best papers will be invited to a special issue of the journal Computer
Science and Information Systems.

Papers must be submitted via Easy Chair at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doing2020


AIMS AND SCOPE

Text are important sources of information and communication in diverse
domains. The intelligent, efficient and secure use of this information
requires, in most cases, the transformation of unstructured textual
data into data sets with some structure, and organized according to an
appropriate schema that follows the semantics of an application
domain. Indeed, solving the problems of modern society requires
interdisciplinary research and information cross-referencing, thus
surpassing the simple provision of unstructured data. There is a need
for representations that are more flexible, subtle and
context-sensitive, which can also be easily accessible via
consultation tools and evolve according to these principles. In this
context, consultation requires robust and efficient processing of
requests, which may involve information analysis, with quality,
consistency, and privacy preservation guarantees. Knowledge bases can
be built as these new generation infrastructures which support data
science queries on a user-friendly framework and are capable of
providing the required machinery for advised decision-making.

The workshop focuses on transforming data into information and then
into knowledge. The idea is to gather researchers in NLP (Natural
Language Processing), DB (Databases), and AI (Artificial Intelligence)
to discuss two main problems :
   - how to extract information from textual data and represent it in
knowledge bases;
   - how to propose intelligent methods for handling and maintaining
these databases with new forms of requests, including efficient,
flexible, and secure analysis mechanisms, adapted to the user, and
with quality and privacy preservation guarantees.

This workshop focuses on all aspects concerning these modern
infrastructures, giving particular attention (but not limited to) to
data related to health and environmental domains.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite the submission of work-in-progress research addressing
various aspects of information extraction from textual data,
intelligent and efficient interrogation, and maintenance of knowledge
bases. The workshop welcomes submissions of theoretical, technical,
experimental, methodological papers, application papers, position
papers and papers on experience reports addressing – though not
limited to – the following topics:

     - Artificial intelligence in databases and information systems
     - Data curation, annotation, and provenance
     - Data management and analytics
     - Data mining and knowledge discovery
     - Data models and query languages
     - Data quality and data cleansing
     - Data science (theory and techniques)
     - Context-aware and adaptive information systems
     - Constraints extraction from text
     - Natural language processing
     - Indexing, query processing and optimization
     - Information and knowledge extraction
     - Information integration
     - Information quality
     - Graph databases
     - Knowledge bases (querying, management, evolution and dynamics)
     - Machine learning for knowledge graph construction, completion, 
refinement
     - Machine learning for knowledge and information extraction, for
     instance, named entity disambiguation, sentiment analysis,
     relation extraction, or the detection of claims, facts and stances
     from unstructured documents
     - Machine Learning in NLP
     - Methodologies, models, algorithms, and architectures for applied
     data science
     - NLP for Digital Humanities
     - NLP & Knowledge Graphs
     - Privacy, trust and security in databases
     - Query processing and optimization
     - Question answering over knowledge graphs
     - Text databases

Preferred Application Domains (but not limited to).

     Bio-sciences and healthcare
     Urban economy and urban environments
     Energy
