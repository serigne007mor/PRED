Subject: [liste-egc] RW 2020 - Call for Applications for the 16th Reasoning
 Web Summer School

[apologies for multiple postings]


=================================================================

******************************************************
CALL FOR APPLICATIONS

The 16th Reasoning Web Summer School (RW 2020)
24-26 June, 2020
Virtual event (free registration)

https://2020.declarativeai.net/events/rw-summer-school

Part of "Declarative AI 2020: Rules, Reasoning, Decisions and Explanations"
(DeclarativeAI 2020, https://2020.declarativeai.net)
******************************************************

The purpose of the Reasoning Web Summer School is to disseminate recent
advances on reasoning techniques and related issues that are of particular
interest to Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. It is primarily
intended
for postgraduate (PhD or MSc) students, postdocs, young researchers, and
senior
researchers wishing to deepen their knowledge. In 2020, the broad theme of
the
school is:

â€œDeclarative Artificial Intelligenceâ€

As in the previous years, lectures in the summer school will be given by a
distinguished group of expert lecturers.

This year the school is part of Declarative AI 2020
(https://2020.declarativeai.net),
an event which is co-organised by SINTEF AS, University of Oslo, and
Norwegian University of Science and Technology, under the umbrella of the
SIRIUS Centre for Scalable Data Access. Due to the current situation
regarding the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, Declarative AI 2020 will
be held as an ONLINE event.

The school is co-located with:

- RuleML+RR: International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning, Virtual
29 June - 1 July, 2020
http://2020.ruleml-rr.org

- DecisionCAMP, Virtual
29 June - 1 July, 2020
https://decisioncamp2020.home.blog

The students attending the RW school are particularly encouraged to apply
