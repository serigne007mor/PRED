Web Intelligence Summer School - The Web of Data
25th-29th August, 2014

Data is no longer an asset that only companies and organisations deal
with. Recently, Web data has become crucial to our daily life. Open data
is transforming institutions, people are sharing increasingly private
and sensitive data on social networks, access to web APIs facilitates
application development, and linked data is changing the Web into a huge
database. The Web of Data is thus complementing the existing Web of
multimedia documents, the Social Web and the Web of Applications. In
this situation everybody should be aware of data management,
manipulation, access and visualisation.

During one week, the Web Intelligence community in Rh=F4ne Alpes and
Universit=E4t Bonn will bring together Web of Data experts who will equip
the participants with scientific and practical competence via lectures
and hands-on sessions, enabling them to contribute to and take advantage
of the full potential of the Web of Data.

Programme overview
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The programme will alternate between keynote speakers, technical
lectures, hands-on sessions, and social events. We want to focus on
practical work and guarantee that at least half of the tutorials will be
dedicated to the hands-on sessions. A poster session will be organised
where students will have the opportunity to present their own work.

Here are the keynote speakers:

 - Stefan Decker, director of Insight Galway (formerly DERI) and full
professor at the National University of Ireland, Galway, one of the most
highly cited authors in the field of Web data and Semantic Web, will
deliver the introductory talk at the Summer School.

 - S=F6ren Auer, full professor at University Bonn and researcher at
Fraunhofer, leader of the EIS group and previously leader and founder of
the AKSW group at University Leipzig. He also leads the steering
committee of the European Data Forum.

 - Markus Kr=F6tzsch, group leader at University Dresden, co-creator and
maintainer of Semantic Media Wiki, developer of the Wikidata project,
will speak about Wikidata, the most amazing project from the Wikimedia
foundation since Wikipedia itself!

 - Eric Prud'hommeaux, sanitation engineer at the W3C, who contributed
to the development of many of the data-related Web standards, will speak
about the role of the W3C in building the Web of Data and how it
revolutionises clinical data.
