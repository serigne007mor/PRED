The Vision and Content Engineering Lab (LVIC) of CEA LIST (French Atomic Co=
mmission), an interdisciplinary group that works on multimedia and multilin=
gual data analysis and understanding, with a focus on fast growing and larg=
e public application domains, announces the availability of a 2-years post =
doctoral position.


The position is associated to the MUCKE project, funded within the CHIST-ER=
A funding scheme of the FP7, which fosters highly innovative and multidisci=
plinary collaborative projects in information and communication sciences an=
d technologies. The project started in October 2012. Its main objective is =
to devise new and reliable knowledge extraction models designed for multili=
ngual and multimodal data shared on social networks.


The post-doctoral researcher will first work on multimodal concept represen=
tation (around 2/3 of the post-doc duration) and then on user credibility e=
stimation for multimedia flows (around 1/3 of the post-doc duration). The f=
irst task will focus on the proposition of innovative language and image pr=
ocessing techniques as well as on their combination using information fusio=
n techniques. Particular attention will be given to the scalability of the =
methods developed because one important project objective is to model a lar=
ge number of concepts (hundreds of thousands) and an important volume of te=
xtual and visual documents (tens of millions). For images, the main problem=
s tackled in MUCKE are parsimonious local image description, large scale co=
ncept detection and concept visualness. Multimedia fusion will be based on =
probabilistic models that move beyond a scoring of similarity towards provi=
ding an actual probability of relevance. For textual documents, the objecti=
ve is to depart from text representations as bags of words (unigrams) to re=
presentations as vectors of unambiguous concepts and entities through conce=
pt and entity recognition and disambiguation.


The second task will focus on the proposition of a novel model for estimati=
ng user credibility for multimedia flows, which combines content and struct=
ural features of the user=92s networked representation. Using results obtai=
ned for concept representation, credibility estimation will be cast as an i=
nformation fusion problem, with a first step that combines textual and visu=
al information and a second step that combines user content and context. An=
other important credibility related question that will be investigated is w=
hether credibility should be a global characteristic of a user or domain re=
lated.


Candidates must hold a PhD in Computer Science obtained less than two years=
 ago or expect to complete it before December 2013 and must be under 30 yea=
rs old. Experience in Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval or=
 Computer Vision is expected, as well as willingness to learn new topics re=
lated to the post-doc.


The lab is situated in Palaiseau, 20 km south of Paris and is part of the C=
EA LIST Institute, which focuses its research activities on developing inno=
vative technologies for smart and complex systems. The post-doc will be par=
t of the lab's multimedia team, which consists of researchers in NLP, compu=
ter vision and multimedia processing. The working language is English. A mo=
re detailed description of LVIC's activities is available at http://www.kal=
isteo.fr/en/index.htm.


For further information, please send an expression of interest to adrian.po=
pescu@cea.fr, attaching a CV and a cover letter. The position is available =
from October 2013 and is open until filled.
