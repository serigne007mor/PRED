Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: IJCNN 2015 Special Session on Scalable Machine
 Learning for Data Stream (SML-DS)

IEEE IJCNN 2015 Special Session on Scalable Machine Learning for Data
Stream (SML-DS)
July 12 - 17, 2015, Killarney, Ireland.
https://sites.google.com/site/nqdoan/home/special-session

--- Important Dates ---
=E2=97=8F     Paper submission: January 15, 2015
=E2=97=8F     Paper decision notification: March 15, 2015
=E2=97=8F     Camera-ready submission: April 15, 2015


--- Objectives ---
In many fields, such as multimedia, insurance information systems,
bio-bioinformatics, and with advances in data collection and storage
technologies have allowed companies to accumulate and to acquire vast
amounts of data (Terabyte, Petabyte, and sometimes Zettabyte). In many
cases the data may arrive very rapidly in streaming. A data stream is
often presented as an ordered sequence of data that in many
applications can be read only once or a small number of times using
limited computing and storage capabilities. Recent trends in hardware
have brought new challenges to the programming and machine learning
community and multi-core systems. Data explosion involves that machine
learning algorithms are adapted using the new parallelism paradigm as
=E2=80=9CMapReduce=E2=80=9D. Somme researches have proposed incremental, co=
llaborative
and online learning methods making it possible to deal with massive
data (big data). This requires a process capable of dealing data
continuously with restrictions of memory and time.

This special session offers a meeting opportunity for academic and
industry researchers in the fields of machine learning, neural
network, data visualization, and Big Data to discuss new areas of
learning methods and experimental design. We encourage researchers and
practitioners to submit papers describing original research addressing
data stream and scalable machine learning challenges.

=E2=97=8F     Clustering, classification from data streams
=E2=97=8F     Neural networks approaches

=E2=97=8F     Applications of detecting changes of evolving data
=E2=97=8F     Clustering and classification of data of changing distributio=
ns.
