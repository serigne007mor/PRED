CALL FOR PAPERS

6th International Workshop on WEB INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNITIES (WI&C'14)
http://wic.litislab.fr

to be held at the 2014 World Wide Web International Conferences (WWW'14)
Seoul, Korea, April 8, 2014

*Important Dates:*

Paper submission deadline:  Jan 7, 2014 (23:59 Hawaii Standard Time)
Acceptance notification: Feb 4, 2014
Camera ready paper: Feb 12, 2014 (hard deadline)

Proceedings published in ACM Digital Library series.

*INVITED SPEAKER*

We are honored to have an invited talk from
Professor Sören Auer, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn & 
Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems 
(IAIS), Germany

*SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP*

Web Intelligence consists of a multidisciplinary area dealing with 
exploiting data and services over the Web, to create new data and 
services using both Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Communities appear as a 
first-class object in the areas of web intelligence and agent 
technologies, as well as a crucial crossroads of several sub-domains 
(i.e. user modelling, protocols, data management, data mining, content 
modelling, etc.). These sub-domains impact the nature of the communities 
and the applications which are related to them. These applications are 
numerous, and the success of well-known Social Network Sites for 
entertainment should not be allowed to over-shadow the other application 
domains, for instance in education, health, design, knowledge 
management, and so forth.

The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for 
researchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative 
networks, such as virtual communities. The possibilities and 
consequences of the web usage for collaborative networks are tremendous 
and new tools are required to satisfy users and service providers.

The workshop Web Intelligence and Communities expects contributions on 
topics such as:

- User centric application based on social intelligence
- Linked data and big data for e-Communities
- Semantics and ontologies for e-Communities
- SOA, services and cloud for e-Communities
- Multi-agent models and tools for e-Communities
- Storage, querying, and diffusion
- Social, psychological and economical aspects of e-Communities
- Innovation and e-Communities
- Social networks enhancements
- Mobility and context-awareness
- e-Communities in ambient intelligence
- Transient e-Communities
- Personalisation, reputation and recommendations
- Privacy, security and trust aspects in e-Communities
- Applications: e-* (learning, health, government, games etc.)
- Performances evaluation, experiments, and user feed-back
- Process modelling for e-Communities


*SUBMISSIONS*

The Web Intelligence and Communities workshop welcomes the submission of 
theoretical, experimental, methodological as well as application papers.
Discussion papers and demonstration papers are also welcome.

Submitted papers should be 10 pages maximum in length (4 pages for the 
discussion and demonstration papers), including figures and references.
The paper must be formatted in pdf according to style guidelines of ACM 
SIG Proceedings Template available here:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

All submissions should be done online on the workshop submission web 
site: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wic14
