Subject: Call for your participation in "E-workshop on GANs for Media Conte=
nt Generation", October 1st, 2020=0A=
=0A=
Dear AI and/or Digital Media enthusiasts,=0A=
=0A=
you are welcome to attend FOR FREE the "e-Workshop on GANs for Media Conten=
t Generation", on October 1st, 2020, in the framework of EU-funded H2020 R&=
D project AI4Media: https://ai4media.eu.=0A=
=0A=
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are part of the cutting edge in rece=
nt machine learning research. Trained by exploiting the interplay between a=
 generative and a discriminative deep neural network, GANs are able to impl=
icitly model the data distribution, thus allowing us to generate realistic =
data samples after model training is complete.=0A=
The Digital Media sector is perhaps the greatest beneficiary of GAN-based a=
lgorithms, with industry-relevant research already taking advantage of thei=
r potential. They are useful for a wide range of media-related applications=
, such as image-to-image translation, optical recognition enhancement, text=
-to-speech systems, music/image/video generation, video summarization, imag=
e anonymization and many others, frequently giving rise to state-of-the-art=
 results.=0A=
On the negative side, the rise of so-called "deep fakes" poses significant =
new challanges, both ethical and technical, thus making the development of =
methods to robustly detect them a top priority. Overall, GANs hold the key =
to revolutionizing the way we produce media and arts content.=0A=
=0A=
The AI4Media project focuses on building a network of research excellence t=
hat will deliver the next generation of core AI advances to serve the key s=
ector of Media. In this context, this Workshop is meant to disseminate know=
ledge regarding GAN-based state-of-the-art for media content generation and=
 for fake media detection. The workshop lectures are at CS/ECE/EE graduate =
level. MSc/PhD/Postodoc researchers are particularly welcomed from Europe a=
nd around the world.=0A=
=0A=
The lectures will be presented live by senior or Postdoc researchers from s=
everal AI4Media consortium members and collaborators across Europe.=0A=
You can attend using Webex, accessed nthrough the Workshop website:   https=
