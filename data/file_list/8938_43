Introduction

Modeling enterprise information systems is a very challenging task that 
requires the collaboration and coordination of a multidisciplinary team. 
Such a task requires the intersection of several disciplines such as 
business modelling, modelling of information systems, multi agents 
systems and so on. Therefore, a new publication in the proposed area 
with contributions from well-known specialists will certainly be of use 
to a large audience. Furthermore, most of the publications will be 
presented and discussed in an international conference, thus, 
contributions in this new publication will be checked and tested in 
front of an international group of specialists.

Objective

This publication titled "Automated Enterprise Systems for Maximizing 
Business Performance" aims at bringing to a large audience of 
researchers in the scientific community, the latest development in the 
field of modeling business automated systems. Chapters of this book will 
cover different aspects of designing and implementing automated 
enterprise systems with the goal of maximizing the performance of the 
system. The process of designing an optimal enterprise system requires 
the intersection of a number of different disciplines such as business 
modeling, modeling of information systems, data mining, big data, etc., 
and thus, a multi-facet view of the problem is required. The aim of this 
publication is to present in one volume the experience of researchers 
from many countries in the world. This experience maybe be of great use 
to undergraduate and graduate students as a tool of knowledge advancement.

Target Audience

The book would be a valuable source of information to a large audience 
of readers such as graduate students, information system practitioners 
and enterprise managers. In this book, well-known authors will present 
the newest advances in the field of business modeling, information 
systems, web-based enterprise applications, enterprise ontology design 
and development, etc. Theoretical and practical solutions in the area of 
decision support systems would be of relevant importance to all 
interested in getting exposed to the most up to date achievements in 
this field.
