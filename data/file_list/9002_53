Subject: [liste-egc] ACM/IEEE SeceS'11:  Workshop on Security and Privacy
 Preserving in e-Societies - Lebanon (extended deadline: April 15th, 2011)

********************** sorry for cross postings *********************

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------

The 1st International Workshop on Security and Privacy Preserving in e-Soci=
eties (SeceS'11)
                           Tehnically sponsored by ACM SIGAPP.fr
                 In cooperation with ACM SIGAPP and IEEE Lebanon Computer C=
hapter
                                 Antonine University, Lebanon
                                     June 9-10, 2011
                                 http://seces.upa.edu.lb



Description
------------
Recently information technologies have invaded almost every aspect of our m=
odern life.
The effects of the World Wide Web and more recently Web 2.0, computers, and=
 telecommunications on societies
have emerged to cover new form of social cyberspace as reference to digital=
 society or e-Society.
In fact, the e-Society is the result of an emerging era of digitalizing dif=
ferent forms of multimedia information
making time and space compression a constant evolving task.
E-Society represents a revolutionary change in the way people interact with=
 each others beyond countries
boundaries. It provides individuals, such as end-users and organizations,
the ability to easily share and publish corporate data, visions, and strate=
gies.
Nonetheless, with this emerging social interaction and the wide range of sh=
ared data,
several privacy and confidentiality concerns arise. Mechanisms used to harv=
est social information represent
a privacy threat for users in many situations and such concerns fall beyond=
 security administrators duties
and target end-users in their daily tasks.
Approaches proposed in the literature to provide safe data publishing have =
several drawbacks related,
on one hand, to the heterogeneous types of data addressed, and, on the othe=
r hand, to complexity in
specifying privacy and security rules.


Topics
-------

The aim of the workshop on Security and Privacy Preserving in e-Societies i=
s to pin down
the latest techniques, studies, and approaches related to security and priv=
acy preserving in the
digital society in the following (but not limited) topics:

    * Access control
    * Content protection
    * Data protection
    * Database security
    * Data association detection
    * Data integrity
    * Information hiding
    * Inference detection
    * Inference elimination
    * Knowledge discovery and privacy
    * Multimedia mining threats
    * Multimedia security
    * Multimedia privacy
    * Multimedia hiding
    * Network security
    * Network intrusion detection
    * Quantifying threat
    * Social networks security
    * Social networks privacy preserving
    * Security and privacy policies
