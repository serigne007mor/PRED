Special section on “Spatial Data Warehouses and SOLAP”

Submission deadline: September 15th, 2012

Guest editors:
Dr. Sandro Bimonte, Irstea, Clermont-Ferrand, France
Dr. François Pinet, Irstea, Clermont-Ferrand, France
Dr. André Miralles, UMR TETIS, Montpellier, France
Prof. Petraq Papajorgji, European University of Tirana, Albania


Data Warehouses (DW) and OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools are 
used in Business Intelligence (BI) applications in order to support 
decision-making processes. DW are a specific type of database used to 
integrate, accumulate and analyze data from various sources. OLAP tools 
provide means to query and to analyze the warehoused information and 
produce online statistical summaries (indicators) at different levels of 
details. These indicators are computed using aggregate functions (e.g. 
Sum, Avg, Min, Max, etc.). Users can explore DW by performing OLAP 
operations (e.g., Roll-up, Drill-down, etc.). Data mining algorithms can 
also be used in DW, aiming towards improving data analysis; these 
techniques help to discern automatically the correlations and causal 
links between data.

The increasing availability of geo-referenced data has made necessary 
the need to enrich OLAP with spatial analysis tools. OLAP systems were 
successfully adapted to solve problems in different areas of application 
and new kinds of decision support systems, named Spatial Data Warehouses 
(SDW) and Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) tools have been made available. SDW are a 
collection of geographical information supporting spatial analysis. 
SOLAP tools allow users to perform spatio-temporal exploration of data: 
these tools combine OLAP analysis with cartographic visualization 
capabilities of GIS systems. The relevance of SOLAP technology has been 
widely recognized in several application domains (e.g., marketing, 
agriculture, environmental risk management, etc.).

Data Warehouses related technologies raise for discussion several 
research issues from implementation, modeling and visualization point of 
view. Traditional GIS-based techniques need to be adapted to SDW/SOLAP 
architectures. The objective of this special section is to present to a 
wide audience of researchers the latest theoretical and practical 
advances in the field of SDW and SOLAP.

The topics applied to SDW/SOLAP to be considered for this publication 
are the followings (the list is non-exhaustive):
-    Conceptual, logical and physical modelling
-    Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL)
-    Geographic data integration
-    Data quality
-    Metadata
-    Uncertain, incomplete and imprecise spatial information management
-    Integration of SOLAP and data mining techniques
-    Performance optimisation and tuning
-    Multidimensional modelling and queries
-    Evaluation, benchmarking and comparison of SOLAP tools
-    Active and Real-time spatial data warehouses
-    Geo-visualisation
-    Integration of spatial analysis methods in Spatial OLAP
-    Complex spatial data (field data, multi-representation, etc.)
-    Cloud computing
-    Etc.

The special section will have 4 full-length papers. Articles are between 
5000 and 8000 words. Manuscripts will be reviewed by at least three 
experts in the field.

Authors should submit their manuscripts online: http://gein.edmgr.com/

Submission deadline: September 15th, 2012

Submission of a manuscript implies: that the work described has not been 
published before; that it is not under consideration for publication 
anywhere else; that its publication has been approved by all co-authors, 
if any, as well as by the responsible authorities – tacitly or 
explicitly – at the institute where the work has been carried out.
