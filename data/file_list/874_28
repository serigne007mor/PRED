  Call for papers for the 1st International Workshop on "Advances in Concep=
tual
  Knowledge Engineering"
  in conjunction with DEXA 2007



  http://www.dexa.org



  Regensburg, Germany

  3-7 September 2007


  Organised by: Sadok Ben Yahia (Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, Tunisia), Je=
an Diatta (IREMIA, La R=E9union Island, France) and Engelbert Mephu Nguifo =
(CRIL, France)



  Knowledge engineering (KE) consists in building, maintaining and developi=
ng knowledge-based systems. It has a great deal in common with software eng=
ineering,=20

  and is related to many computer science domains such as artificial intell=
igence, databases, data mining, expert systems, decision support systems, u=
ser=20

  modelling, web technologies, computational linguistics and geographic inf=
ormation systems.=20


  Knowledge engineering is also related to mathematical logic, as well as s=
trongly involved in cognitive science and socio-cogintive engineering where=
 the=20

  knowledge is produced by socio-cognitive aggregates (mainly humans) and i=
s structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logi=
c works.=20

  Various activities of KE specific for the development of a knowledge-base=
d system: Assessment of the problem; Development of a knowledge-based syste=
m=20

  shell/structure; Implementation of the structured knowledge into knowledg=
e-bases; Acquisition and structuring of the related information, knowledge =
and=20

  specific preferences; Testing and validation of the inserted knowledge; I=
ntegration and maintenance of the system; Revision and evaluation of the sy=
stem.=20

  Being still more art than engineering, KE is not as neat as the above lis=
t in practice. The phases overlap, the process might be iterative, and many=
=20

  challenges could appear. Recently, emerges meta-knowledge engineering as =
a new formal systemic approach to the development of an unified knowledge a=
nd=20

  intelligence theory.

  Conceptual knowledge engineering aims to put more emphasis on the interre=
lationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable =
them to=20

  function togetherduring the KE process. One major goal here is to focus t=
he KE process onto the design of conceptual models, methods and structures.=
 Our=20

  objective in this workshop is to provide information on recent advances o=
n KE using conceptual similarity-based measures, concept lattices, conceptu=
al=20

  graphs, rough sets, description logics, concept mapping, ontologies and m=
ore, in both theoretical and applicational aspects of KE.


  The ultimate aim of this workshop is to provide state-of-the-art informat=
ion to academics, researchers, and industry practitioners whom are involved=
 or=20

  interested in both theoretical and applicational aspects of conceptual kn=
owledge engineering. Prospective authors are invited to submit original and=
=20

  previously unpublished research showing related to the following topics:=
=20

  * Conceptual structures,=20
  *Relationship of FCA with other methods of data analysis (clustering, ass=
ociation rules, classification, etc.),=20
  *Data for Formal Concept Analysis (object-attribute data, pre-processing =
of data, conceptual scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.),=20
  * Applications FCA on semantic web and ontologies,=20

  Instructions for authors and Important dates


  Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research and applicat=
ion
  papers that are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will
  be limited to 5 two-column pages (IEEE Proceeding style) including figures
  and references. Please comply with the IEEE Computer Society Press Procee=
dings
  Author Guidelines to prepare your papers. Electronic submission
  of manuscripts (in postscript, word or pdf format) is required and will be
  handled via the workshop Web site (to be announced soon). For any further
  inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact the workshop organizers.
  In addition, at least one author of each accepted paper is required to at=
tend
  the conference and present the paper. Papers accepted for presentation
  will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press as proceedings of the
  DEXA 2007 workshops.


  **Important dates:

  Deadline for authors to submit papers: March 26th, 2007
  Notification of review results: April 26th, 2007
