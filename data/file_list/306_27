CALL FOR PAPERS

The 1st WORKSHOP on MINING MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATABASES
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 2008 ECML/PKDD CONFERENCE
September 19, 2008
Antwerp, Belgium

Workshop Chairs: A. Laurent, J. Pei
Organization Chair: M. Plantevit

Multidimensional data are inherent in many applications such as 
e-commerce, telecommunication, retail, financial markets, scientific 
data, bioinformatics data.  Mining multidimensional data plays a 
critical role in both theoretical data mining research and data mining 
development.

The First International Workshop on Multidimensional Data Mining 
(MMD'08) will be an interactive forum to reflect the latest advances and 
understand the new challenges and opportunities in mining 
multidimensional data. The workshop  will focus on the following three 
aspects :
- Mining multidimensional data
- Mining aggregated data
- Managing hierarchies

This workshop will bring together researchers from universities, 
research labs and industry who are involved in different research areas 
dealing with data  mining in multidimensional framework.

We seek original submissions on research contributions or experiment 
reports in a multidimensional framework. The main topics include but are 
not limited to:
- Data models, techniques and methodologies for multidimensional data mining
- Mining unstructured and structured data
- Mining spatial, temporal and multimedia data
- Data mining techniques for multidimensional data: clustering, 
classification, association rules, etc.
- Mining exceptional patterns and outliers in multidimensional data
- Mining multidimensional (multiple) data streams
- Mining multiple time series
- Trend analysis
- Maintaining, storing, and re-using the extracted multidimensional 
knowledge
- Parallel and distributed multidimensional data mining
- Data mining applications : fraud deltection, financial or scientific 
applications, web usage mining, bioinformatics, marketing, etc.

We encourage submissions of work representing early stages of 
cutting-edge research and exploring new kinds of applications. We are 
considering to edit a special issue in an academic journal containing 
some selected papers from the workshop.
