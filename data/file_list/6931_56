WEB INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNITIES (WI&C'15)

CALL FOR PAPERS

7th International Workshop on WEB INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNITIES (WI&C'15)
http://wic.litislab.fr

to be held at the 2015 World Wide Web International Conferences (WWW'15)
Florence, Italy, May 18 or 19, 2015

*Important Dates:*

Paper submission deadline:  Jan 24, 2015 (23:59 Hawaii Standard Time)
Acceptance notification: Feb 22, 2015
Camera ready paper: Mar 8, 2015 (hard deadline)
Workshop: May 18/19, 2015

Proceedings published in WWW's Companion Volume (ACM).

*INVITED SPEAKER*
Peter Mika. Yahoo Research, Barcelona, Spain.
"Social Networks and the Semantic Web: a retrospective of the past 10 years"

*SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP*

Web Intelligence consists of a multidisciplinary area dealing with exploiti=
ng data and services over the Web, to create new data and services using bo=
th Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial Intellig=
ence (AI) techniques. Communities appear as a first-class object in the are=
as of web intelligence and agent technologies, as well as a crucial crossro=
ads of several sub-domains (i.e. user modelling, protocols, data management=
, data mining, content modelling, etc.). These sub-domains impact the natur=
e of the communities and the applications which are related to them. These =
applications are numerous, and the success of well-known Social Network Sit=
es for entertainment should not be allowed to over-shadow the other applica=
tion domains, for instance in education, health, design, knowledge manageme=
nt, and so forth.

The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for res=
earchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative networks, suc=
h as virtual communities. The possibilities and consequences of the web usa=
ge for collaborative networks are tremendous and new tools are required to =
satisfy users and service providers.

The workshop Web Intelligence and Communities expects contributions on topi=
cs such as:

- User centric application based on social intelligence
- Linked data and big data for e-Communities
- Semantics and ontologies for e-Communities
- SOA, services and cloud for e-Communities
- Multi-agent models and tools for e-Communities
- Storage, querying, and diffusion
- Social, psychological and economical aspects of e-Communities
- Innovation and e-Communities
- Social networks enhancements
- Mobility and context-awareness
- Spontaneous social networks
- e-Communities in ambient intelligence
- Transient e-Communities
- Personalisation, reputation and recommendations
- Privacy, security and trust aspects in e-Communities
- Applications of social networks in e-* (learning, health, government, gam=
es etc.)
- Performances evaluation, experiments, and user feed-back
- Process modelling for e-Communities


*SUBMISSIONS*

The Web Intelligence and Communities workshop welcomes the submission of th=
eoretical, experimental, methodological as well as application papers.
Discussion papers and demonstration papers are also welcome.

Submitted papers should be 6 pages maximum in length, including figures and=
 references.
The paper must be formatted in pdf according to style guidelines of ACM SIG=
 Proceedings Template available here:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

All submissions should be done online on the workshop submission web site a=
ccessible from the workshop web site
