The 1st ICC Workshop on Complexity in Social Systems will be concerned=20=
=20
with theories, methodologies, and computational tools related to the=20=20
study of complexity in social systems, aiming to bring together=20=20
researchers to report on progress  in interdisciplinary domains.=20=20
Papers examining both theory and practice are welcome.

Theoretical areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

* methodological issues addressing complexity in social systems
* measures of complexity
* models of emergent social phenomena
* social structure identification and pattern matching in social=20=20
representations
* tools to represent social systems, including dynamic social=20=20
networks, multi-agent based simulation, cellular automata, and dynamic=20=
=20
systems


Application domains might concern, for instance:

* logistics
* traffic regulation
* urban and regional social studies
* decision support systems
* public policies
* economic models
* innovation diffusion networks
* biological inspired representations of social phenomena
* ecological models
* e-health
* propagation models applied to biology, public health (epidemiology),
and others
* communication networks
