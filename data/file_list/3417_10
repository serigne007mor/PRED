BMDA 2020 Call for papers
----------------------------------

3rd International Workshop on Big Mobility Data Analytics (BMDA)
co-located with EDBT/ICDT Conference, March 30 =E2=80=93 April 2, 2020 =
=E2=80=93 Copenhagen, Denmark
http://www.datastories.org/bmda20

* Selected accepted papers will be considered for a special issue at =
Geoinformatica journal *

Workshop Description

=46rom spatial to spatio-temporal and, then, to mobility data. So, =
what=E2=80=99s next? it is the rise of mobility-aware integrated Big =
Data analytics. The Big Mobility Data Analytics (BMDA) workshop, =
initiated in 2018 with EDBT Conference, aims at bringing together =
experts in the field from academia, industry and research labs to =
discuss the lessons they have learned over the years, to demonstrate =
what they have achieved so far, and to plan for the future of =
"mobility". The workshop will foster the exchange of new ideas on =
multidisciplinary real-world problems, discussion on proposals about =
innovative solutions, and identify emerging opportunities for further =
research in the area of big mobility data analytics, covering all layers =
of the Big Data Value Analytics (BDVA) reference model, namely data =
management, data processing, data analytics, and data visualization and =
user interaction. The workshop intends to bridge the gap between =
researchers and big data stakeholders, including experts from critical =
domains, such as urban / maritime / aviation transportation, human =
complex networks, etc.
=20
Multiple fields of data analytics relate to the objectives of this =
workshop, including, but not limited to:
- Fundamentals of mobility data analytics
- Big data platforms for mobility data analytics
- Parallel / streaming data processing for mobility analytics
- Predictive analytics using mobility data
- Complex event detection for moving objects
- Visual analytics on big mobility data
- Mobility-as-a-Service
- Interactive traffic analysis with GPS data
- Urban / maritime / aviation traffic flow forecasting
- Urban / maritime / aviation travel time prediction
- Integration / interlinking of mobility with societal data
- Geosocial networks
- Philosophical / ethical / privacy issues on mobility data analytics

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
We invite papers discussing novel research and ideas without substantial =
overlap with papers that have been published or submitted to a journal =
or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers can be of two types:
- Regular Research Papers: these papers should report original research =
results or significant case studies. They should be 5000-8000 words (at =
most 8 pages) long.
- Position Papers: these papers should report novel research directions =
or identify challenging problems. They should be at most 4 pages long.

Submissions should be formatted using the EDBT/ICDT 2020 camera-ready =
template and submitted through the workshop=E2=80=99s submission system =
at EasyChair [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbmda20].
Following the tradition of recent EDBT/ICDT workshops, all workshop =
papers will be published online at CEUR [http://ceur-ws.org/] published =
under CC-ByY licence. All submitted papers will be peer reviewed by at =
least three reviewers. If accepted, at least one of the authors must =
attend the workshop to present the work.

As with the previous BMDA editions, selected accepted papers will be =
considered for a special issue of Geoinformatica.=20
