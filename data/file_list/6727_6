CALL FOR PAPERS

Started in 2003, RIVF has become a major scientific event for researchers
in the field of Computing and Communication Technologies, not only in
Vietnam but also worldwide. RIVF 2010, held in Hanoi, had received
submissions
coming from 23 countries across all the continents. Its 9th edition will
be hosted by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology of VNU-HCM in 2012.
The 9th RIVF continues to offer an opportunity for researchers and
innovators to discuss problems, share results, identify emerging issues,
and establish academic collaborations in various disciplines of computing
and
communications.
The conference series URL is www.rivf.org or www.rivf.hcmut.edu.vn

CONFERENCE TOPICS

The conference solicits submission of research papers in major areas of
computing and communication, organized into the following seven tracks.
Relevant topics of each track include, but are not limited to:

* Information Management Track: Integrated information systems, decision
   support systems, information security, multimedia systems, e-commerce and

   business integration solutions, architecture, security & performance of
   information systems, public health informatics, knowledge management.

* Computational Intelligence Track: Language and speech processing, soft
   computing, knowledge discovery and data mining, machine learning,
   computational biology, agent-based systems, semantic web, information
   extraction and retrieval.

* Communications and Networking Track: Network architecture, network
protocols
   and security, parallel and distributed computing, grid computing, mobile
   and ubiquitous computing, quantum networks and communications.

* Modeling and Computer Simulation Track: Data visualization, virtual
reality,
   behaviour simulation, scientific computing.

* Applied Operational Research and Optimization Track: Linear programming,
integer
   programming, dynamic programming, constraint propagation, heuristics,
   applications in control, production, and scheduling.

* Software Engineering and Embedded Systems Track: Agile methods,
component-based,
   model-driven, grid-based software engineering, open source software
development,
   product lines, software process, software testing and verification,
embedded
   system testing and verification, integration and test; multi-core
programming,
   real-time systems, web services.

* Human Machine Interface and Imaging Technologies: human-computer interface
and
   interaction, multi media, image processing, imaging in chemistry,
medicine, biology,
   geography, etc.


PAPER SUBMISSION

Authors are invited to submit papers up to 6 pages, in English, describing
the
results of their research, or of their innovative, practical applications
relevant to
the conference topics. All papers must be original contributions and not
previously
published, nor currently under consideration, for publication elsewhere. All
papers
will be submitted on-line, in PDF format using IEEE standard template, to
the
conference website. Each paper will be reviewed by the program committee for

its originality, relevance, and clarity. Accepted papers will be published
in the main
conference proceedings registered with IEEE Xplore and referenced in
international
libraries.


POST CONFERENCE PUBLICATION

Selected best papers will be invited for extension and publication in
special issues
of Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing and International
Journal
of Distributed Systems and Technologies.

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

The conference will be started with one day of tutorials on its topics.
Tutorial
proposals are invited and should be submitted by September 16, 2011, to the
Tutorial
Chair at dtanh@cse.hcmut.edu.vn. Each proposal should include one page of a
sketch
biography of the instructor, outline of the tutorial, and pre-requisites for
the
intended audience.

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

The conference will be started with one day of invited workshops.
Workshop proposals are invited and should be submitted by September 16,
2011, to the
Workshop Chair (TBC). Each proposal should include one page of a sketch
biography of
the instructor, outline of the workshop.
