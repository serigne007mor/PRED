Subject: [liste-egc] Call for Workshops - 10th ESWC 2013 - Semantics and Big
 Data - May 26-30, 2013 - Montpellier, France.

10th ESWC 2013 -- Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013. Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/

=3D=3D=3D=3D Call for Workshops =3D=3D=3D=3D

The organizers the 10th ESWC cordially invite you to submit a workshop prop=
osal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results an=
d innovations in the field of Semantic Web technologies.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points f=
or discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantics and the Se=
mantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with an interdisc=
iplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technology of general=
 interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of wor=
kshop proposals on:

- Fundamental problems of the semantic web such as heterogeneity, scalabili=
ty and distribution,
- Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
- Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the =
Semantic Web, and
- Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far.

*** General Information and Criteria ***

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme com=
mittee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the wor=
kshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will =
determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, =
which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the =
local and the general chair of ESWC 2013.

The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:

- Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESW=
C conference (refer to http://www.eswc-conferences.org).
- Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-conf=
erences.
- We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attr=
act various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
- They are clearly focused.
- There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's=
 topic.
- Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
- We advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, preferabl=
y from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the works=
hop topic.

In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact =
the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note=
 that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the ove=
rall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less t=
han 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early regis=
tration deadline might be canceled.

The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own revi=
ewing process, publicity (e.g., website and call for papers), and proceedin=
gs production. They will be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop=
 Chair and the ESWC 2013 local organizers to finalize all organizational de=
tails. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2013 workshop registration fee,=
 as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for work=
shop and tutorials, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fee=
s.
Further, each workshop or tutorial that attracts more than 15 registered pa=
rticipants (excluding the organizers) will get one full registration for th=
e conference. This registration can be used for example to pay for an invit=
ed speaker.

*** Submission Guidelines ***

Workshop proposals have to be submitted via Easychair (https://www.easychai=
r.org/conferences/?conf=3Deswc2013workshops). Each proposal must consist of=
 a single PDF document, not longer than 3 pages, which contains the followi=
ng information:

1. The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying it=
s goals and motivation.
2. A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this ti=
me.
3. A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, the =
workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
4. A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, dis=
cussing the mix of events such as paper presentations, invited talks, panel=
s, hacking session, or general discussion.
5. A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% hav=
e to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
6. An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-da=
y or full-day event.
7. If there have been previous editions of the workshop, their short descri=
ption, including URLs as well as some statistics about submissions and acce=
ptance rate, plus number of participants.
8. The names and contact information (web page, email address) of the propo=
sed organizing committee and short description of their relevant experience=
. Preferably a single contact person per submission.

The best papers of each workshop will be included in the supplementary proc=
eedings of ESWC 2013, which will appear in the Springer LNCS series.
