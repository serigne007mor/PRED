Subject: [liste-egc] [Extended Deadline] Journal Special Issue on "Heuristic
 acquisition for data science"

--00000000000001384c059af2d168
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

*Special Issue*: Heuristic acquisition for data science.
*Journal:* Information System Frontiers (ISF), Springer.
*Keywords:* Heuristic acquisition, generalization, heuristic logics,
optimization, deep learning, machine learning.
*Guest Editors: *Lydia Bouzar-Benlabiod, Stuart H. Rubin.

*Description*
Systems are becoming more and more complex and dynamic. This upswing
increases the demand to find search techniques that can get a good enough
solution in a reasonable time.
In another side, a huge amount of data has been accumulated over the years.
These data hide treasures for different fields and may be used for many
purposes; with data, one can
(1) analyze the behavior of competitors and consumers and predict their
future behaviors, (2) understand the system better and then generalize the
available knowledge or even generate
new knowledge, (3) diagnose faults in strategies and systems, etc.
Traditional approaches in statistics, machine learning, and traditional
data analysis fail to address this level of
complexity. The need thus arises for better approaches that can handle
complex models and analyze the available data in a reasonable amount of
time.
Heuristics are algorithmic methods, which favor quick responses to the
detriment of the accuracy of the answer. This special issue seeks to answer
to the following questions:
What does heuristic acquisition contribute to the problem-solving process?
What do they make solvable, which would not be in their absence? Which
among a plethora of techniques
for heuristic acquisition are best and why, etc.?
This Special Issue calls for scientific contributions as well as industrial
experiences in applying heuristics to one or more of the following areas:

=EF=82=B7 Heuristics for optimizing deep neural architectures
=EF=82=B7 Numerical analysis
=EF=82=B7 Healthcare
