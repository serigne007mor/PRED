Dear Colleague,

You are cordially invited to the XIII International Conference "Applied=20
Stochastic Models and Data Analysis" (ASMDA-2009), June 30-July 3,=20
2009, Vilnius, LIthuania.

Introduction
******************************
Since 1981, the aim of ASMDA has been to serve as an interface=20
between Stochastic Modeling and Data Analysis and their real life=20
applications such as business, finance and insurance, management,=20
production and reliability, biology and medicine. The 2009 Conference=20
will take place in Vilnius, Lithuania. Both theoretical and practical=20
contributions presenting new results and having the potential for=20
solving real-life problems are concerned. Acting as an interface=20
between theory and practice, ASMDA is of great interest for both the=20
academic and the business world. The high standard of of ASMDA=20
meetings is guaranteed by international scientific committees and=20
recently by a permanent world-wide ASMDA Committee.=20

Venue:=20
********************************
VILNIUS, the capital of the Republic of Lithuania, becomes one of the=20

craftsmen from Western Europe to settle =C2=93in the capital Vilnius=C2=94.

Vilnius is also a historical centre, its old city is one of the biggest in=
=20
Eastern Europe (360 ha). The most precious historical and cultural=20
heritage is concentrated in the capital. The buildings of the old town =C2=
=96=20
around 1,5 thousand =C2=96 are from different ages and all European styles=
=20
of architecture. Though Vilnius is referred to as a baroque city,=20
here you can also find gothic, renaissance, classicism and jugendstyle=20
