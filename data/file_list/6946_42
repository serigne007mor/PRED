=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The 13th International Conference on Software Engineering Research,
Management and Applications (SERA 2015) provides an international forum
where engineers, researchers, and advanced graduate students are invited to
present their experiences and their recent advances and latest research
results related to all aspects of software engineering research and
applications. The conference is structured to cover the complete software
lifecycle from design through deployment to maintenance and evolution. SERA
2015 will include a high quality scientific program, invited speakers,
tutorials and workshops in conjunction with the conference.

Paper Submission
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format through the easychair
system http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsera2015.

We solicit research and experience papers as well as research-in-progress
in any of the technical areas listed under Scope and Topics. Each
submission will be reviewed by three members of the Program Committee.
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of
contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and
appropriate comparison to related work. The decision whether to accept or
reject the paper will be based on the reviews and the consensus of the
program committee.

Authors are invited to submit full papers (6 pages) of double column text

CPS Publishing PDF specifications (
http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting) before submitting your
paper.
Up to an extra 2 pages (total of 8) can be purchased at registration time.

To ensure a blind review, the author=E2=80=99s name and address MUST NOT ap=
pear in
the submitted paper.
