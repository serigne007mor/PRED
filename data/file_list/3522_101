************************************************

*Title: *Complex graph data analysis with incomplete / incomplete data

*Laboratory: *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Laboratoire Hubert Curien (LabHC UMR CNR=
S 5516), =C2=A0=20
Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet, Saint-=C3=89tienne, France

*Keywords:* Data mining, Machine learning, Social network, Graphs=20
analysis, Incomplete / imperfect data

*General Overview:*
In many applications, the data to be studied is relational, modeled in=20
the form of a network represented by graphs. This representation allows=20
capturing not only the information about entities (using attributes or=20
properties) but also the relationships between them.
While the ability to discover knowledge from such network data is=20
gaining in importance, the quality became a central issue in their=20
exploitation. The aim of this PhD is first to study the impact of the=20
lack of quality of relational data on the data mining and machine=20
learning algorithms and, second to design robust methods to deal with=20
imperfect and incomplete relational data and=C2=A0 able to provide=20
explainable results

*Working environment:*
The PhD candidate will work at the Laboratoire Hubert Curien (UMR 5516)=20
under the supervision of=C2=A0 Baptiste Jeudy, Charlotte Laclau and Chris=
tine=20
Largeron, (LabHC =E2=80=93 Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet, Saint-Etienne, Fr=
ance).

*Funding:*
The PhD fellowship is funded for 3 years from October 2022 and is=20
monthly funded about approximatively 1500 =E2=82=AC.

*Profile of the candidate:*
The candidate should have a master degree or equivalent in Computer=20
Science. The subject is at the intersection of several domains: graph=20
theory, statistics, data mining and machine learning. Thus the candidate=20
should have strong backgrounds in several of these topics.
Other required skills:
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good abilities in algorithm design and progra=
mming.
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good technical skills regarding data mining, =

sh.
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Good communication skills (oral and written).
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Ability to work in a team with colleagues,
=E2=80=A2=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Autonomy and motivation for research.

*Application instructions:*
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0Applicants are invited to contact as soon as possible=
.
The application file should contain the following documents:
1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 a curriculum vit=C3=A6 (CV);

education degrees (BSc, License, MSc, Master=E2=80=99s degree, Engineer d=

etc.). If the candidate is currently finishing a Master=E2=80=99s degree,=
 s/he=20
must send the transcript of the grades obtained so far, with the rank=20
among her/his peers, and the list of classes taken during the last year;
