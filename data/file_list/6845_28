Subject: [liste-egc] 5 PhD Studentships - Data Science at the Knowledge
 Media Institute, United Kingdom

--001a114dcd6c83b9fd05183e8b25
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Deadline for applications: 13th July 2015
How to apply: http://kmi.open.ac.uk/studentships/vacancies/

The Knowledge Media Institute (KMi) is home to internationally recognised r=
esearchers in semantic technologies, educational multimedia, collaboration =
technologies, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and human-compute=
r interaction. KMi offers students an intellectually challenging environmen=
t with exceptional research and computer facilities.

As part of setting up Data Science as a key research priority for the lab, =
5 PhD Studentships are available to start in October 2015. The deadline for=
 applications is 13th July 2015.

Topics

Data Science is becoming an increasingly critical field in most areas of bu=
siness, academia and everyday life. The rise of the internet of things, of =
online platforms and of social media means that more and more data is being=
 produced, ready to be mined and analysed, to reach a better understanding =
of various processes, ranging from human behaviours to complex (natural or =
organisational) systems. We are therefore looking for the next generation o=
f bright researchers to investigate and solve the key challenges of Data Sc=
ience, including for example:

- How to automatically select and assess analytics workflows in specific sc=
enarios and for specific datasets?
- How to preserve privacy and user-control in a world of Big Web Data?
- How to bring the benefits of data science to everyday life and make it ac=
cessible to people without technical skills?
- How to mine distributed web data and discover new knowledge?
- How to structure unstructured web dialogues around key social issues?
- How to predict sentiments and opinions from data?
- How to develop tools, protocols and guidelines for validating the modelli=
ng process?
- How to algorithmically extract meaning from multimedia contents?

The successful candidates will be integrating a team of highly successful r=
esearchers, and will work in collaboration with ongoing Data Science projec=
ts in KMi. In particular, we are currently working with various stakeholder=
s on the following domains:

Space: The Open University's Faculty of Science<http://www.open.ac.uk/scien=
ce> is conducting world-leading research on space exploration and observati=
on, which is generating massive amounts of data for analysis.
Smart Cities and the Internet of Things: Through MK:Smart<http://www.mksmar=
t.org/> and other projects, KMi is involved in the creation of large data i=
nfrastructures to support innovation in complex urban environments equipped=
 with large scale sensor networks.
Education: With the Open University being the largest university in the UK,=
 and one of the first distance learning institution in the world, the use o=
f open and web data to support effective learning and teaching has been a k=
ey area of research for KMi.
These are examples of domains/research issues that we expect the successful=
 candidates to explore and that research proposals might reference.

Person Profile

Candidates are expected to be creative individuals, able to generate and pu=
rsue original ideas and to organise their own work with minimal day-to-day =
supervision. Candidates should also have very good verbal and written commu=
nication skills, and are able to travel internationally. Good computer prog=
ramming and data analysis skills are essential. Experience with one or more=
 of these areas is highly desirable: machine learning, data mining, semanti=
c technologies, web development, large scale data management, distributed d=
ata architectures.
