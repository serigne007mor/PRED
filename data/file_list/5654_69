Subject: [liste-egc] [CfP] 2nd cut-off date for ECML PKDD 2022 journal track
 in two weeks!

We invite submissions for the journal track of the European Conference on M=
achine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Datab=
ases (ECMLPKDD) 2022=2E The journal track of the conference is implemented =
in partnership with the Machine Learning Journal and the Data Mining and Kn=
owledge Discovery Journal=2E The conference provides an international forum=
 for the discussion of the latest high-quality research results in all area=
s related to machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery=2E=C2=
=A0

*Eligibility Criteria*=C2=A0

Papers on all topics related to machine learning, knowledge discovery, and=
 data mining are invited=2E However, given the special nature of the journa=
l track, only papers that satisfy the quality criteria of journal papers an=
d at the same time lend themselves to conference talks will be considered=
=2E Consequently, journal versions of previously published conference paper=
s, or survey papers will *not* be considered for the special issue=2E Note =
that a paper rejected by the Machine Learning Journal should not be submitt=
ed to the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal and vice versa=2E Pap=
ers that do not fall into the eligible category, or that are found to not s=
atisfy minimum quality criteria during editorial review, may be rejected wi=
thout formal reviews but can of course be resubmitted as regular conference=
 track papers=2E =C2=A0

Authors are encouraged to adhere to the best practices of Reproducible Res=
earch (RR), by making available data and software tools for reproducing the=
 results reported in their papers=2E For the sake of persistence and proper=
 authorship attribution, we require the use of standard repository hosting =
services such as dataverse, mldata, openml, etc=2E for data sets, and mloss=
, bitbucket, github, etc=2E for source code=2E Authors who submit their wor=
k to the ECMLPKDD special issues of these journals commit themselves to pre=
senting their paper at the ECMLPKDD conference if it is accepted=2E=C2=A0

*Reviewing*=C2=A0

The journal track allows continuous submissions from October 2021 to Febru=
ary 2022=2E Papers will be processed and sent out for review after each of =
the following three cutoff dates:=C2=A0

- October 8, 2021=C2=A0
- December 10, 2021=C2=A0
- February 11, 2022=C2=A0

The deadline on each of these dates is 23:59, Pacific Time=2E We strive fo=
r a high quality and efficient review process=2E For each submission, we ai=
m at obtaining at least two reviews from experienced reviewers, including m=
embers of the Guest Editorial Board=2E Our goal is to arrive at an initial =
decision about 10 weeks after each cutoff date, though meeting this target =
may not always be possible=2E After the initial review phase, many papers w=
ill require substantial revisions, and the revised paper will be re-reviewe=
d, which extends the review process=2E Consequently, a paper=E2=80=99s chan=
ce of finishing the review cycle and being included in the ECMLPKDD 2022 sp=
ecial issue decreases with each subsequent cutoff date=2E This means that a=
ccepted papers, especially those that were submitted to the later deadlines=
, may be included in the ECMLPKDD 2023 (or even later) special issue (and s=
ubject to approval of the ECMLPKDD steering committee and future organizers=
)=2E The reviewing process is single-blind=2E=C2=A0

*Submission Procedure* =C2=A0

Starting from the second cutoff date (December 10, 2021) we require to sub=
mit your paper simultaneously to the CMT conference system (ECML PKDD 2022 =
Journal Track: https://cmt3=2Eresearch=2Emicrosoft=2Ecom/ECMLPKDD2022/) and=
 the Springer Editorial Manager=2E For the latter system, authors make a jo=
urnal submission to either the Springer Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery=
 journal (https://www=2Eeditorialmanager=2Ecom/dami/default=2Easpx) or the =
Springer Machine Learning journal (https://www=2Eeditorialmanager=2Ecom/mac=
h/default=2Easpx), and select the type of submission to be for the ECMLPKDD=
 2022 special issue=2E =C2=A0

We use both submission systems to improve and speed up the reviewing proce=
ss=2E The use of CMT enables Guest Editors and Reviewers to start the revie=
wing process much earlier=2E Note, however, that reviews, any required revi=
sions, and final decisions will be made in the Springer Editorial Manager=
=2E=C2=A0

It is recommended that submitted papers do not exceed 25 pages including r=
eferences=2E Every paper may be accompanied with unlimited appendices (bein=
g a part of the same pdf file)=2E The papers should follow the submission g=
uidelines found on the respective journals=E2=80=99 home pages=2E Templates=
 can be found at https://www=2Espringernature=2Ecom/gp/authors/campaigns/la=
tex-author-support=2E=C2=A0

Both journals require authors to include an information sheet (for Machine=
 learning submissions) or a cover letter (up to 2 pages) as a supplementary=
 material (for Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery submissions) that contai=
ns a short summary of their contribution and specifically address the follo=
wing questions:=C2=A0

- What is the main claim of the paper? Why is this an important contributi=
on to the machine learning/data mining literature?=C2=A0
- What is the evidence provided to support claims? Be precise=2E=C2=A0
- Report 3-5 most closely related contributions in the past 7 years (autho=
red by researchers outside the authors=E2=80=99 research group) and briefly=
 state the relation of the submission to them=2E=C2=A0
- Who are the most appropriate reviewers for the paper? Authors are requir=
ed to suggest up to four candidate reviewers (especially if external to the=
 Guest Editorial Board), including a brief motivation for each suggestion=
=2E=C2=A0
- Optionally, list up to four researchers/potential reviewers with competi=
ng interests that should not be considered for reviewers=2E=C2=A0
