The Belief Function Theory represents a new approach devised to model and
manage imprecise information in Artificial and Computational Intelligence. =
The
theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in the
context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn Shafer as
a general framework for modeling epistemic uncertainty. These early
contributions have been the starting points of many important developments,
including the Transferable Belief Model and the Theory of Hints. The theory
of belief functions is now well established as a general framework for
reasoning with uncertainty, and has well understood connections to other
frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability
theories. The field of application of this theory is very large.

The aim of this first spring school is to promote this theory and to
introduce interested students and researchers to the basics of Belief
Functions, both theoretical and applied. The school is organized into
several lectures given by international experts. They will bring both
theoretical and practical backgrounds, in a friendly environment favoring
interaction between participants. An important part of the time will be
devoted to the resolution of proposed exercises concerning applied problems.
One objective of the school is to enable non specialists as well as
potential users to become acquainted with the principles and fundamentals of
the theory.*
