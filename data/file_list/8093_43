Subject: [liste-egc] CFP - Journal of Decision Systems - Special Issue on
 Knowledge and Group Decision Making


Journal of Decision Systems- Special Issue on Knowledge and Group=20=20
Decision Making

This Special Issue stems from the 2013 international conference on=20=20
Knowledge Management, Information and Knowledge Systems (KMIKS 2013),=20=20
which took place on 18-20th April 2013, Hammamet, Tunisia,=20=20
http://kmiks2013.aigtunisie.org/.


SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
More and more organizations are becoming aware of the importance of=20=20
tacit and explicit knowledge owned by their members which corresponds=20=20
to their experience and accumulated knowledge about the firm=20=20
activities. However, considering the large amount of knowledge created=20=
=20
and used in the organization, especially with the evolution of=20=20
information and communications technologies, the firm must determine=20=20
the specific knowledge in order to handle many real-world decision=20=20
problems. These usually imply multiple decision makers with=20=20
conflicting objectives and distinct value systems. Creating activities=20=
=20
to enhance identification and use of this knowledge is a powerful mean=20=
=20
to improve the level of performance of the organization. Thus,=20=20
companies invest on knowledge and information systems, in order to=20=20
develop a knowledge sharing and collaboration culture, to make easier=20=20
group decision making.
Researchers and practitioners are invited to propose recent advances=20=20
in methodologies, models and tools based on knowledge for group=20=20
decision making.

Topics of interest will include, but are not limited to:
-	Knowledge sharing and collaborative decision making
-	Knowledge systems for group decision making
-	knowledge and Inter-organizational decision support
-	Inter-organizational knowledge for decision making
-	Web 2.0 tools for collaborative decision making
-	Knowledge based Multi-agent systems for decision making
-	Ontology for decision making
