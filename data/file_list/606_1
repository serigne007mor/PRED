!!! Advance Registration by 25 OCT 2006 !!!
-----------------------------------------------
On-line registration (and more information) at
http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/iwi06/

Regular registration covers all the events of
ICDM-WI-IAT'06 during the four conference days
including workshops and tutorials, and includes
proceedings for one of the conferences and its
associated workshops.

************************************************

ICDM '06, WI'06 and IAT'06 will be co-located, providing
synergism among the three research areas: Data Mining, Web
Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology. This provides
opportunities for technical collaboration beyond that of previous
conferences. The three conferences will have a joint opening, keynote,
reception, and banquet. Attendees only need to register for one
conference and can attend workshops, sessions, invited talks, panels
and tutorials across the three conferences.=20
