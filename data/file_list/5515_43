AALTD 2022: CALL FOR PAPERS

https://project.inria.fr/aaltd22/ <https://project.inria.fr/aaltd21/>

################################################################################

The 7thInternational Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on 
Temporal Data (AALTD 2021)will be held on Friday, September 23, 2022, 
co-located with the ECML/PKDD 2022 hybrid conference 
(https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org <https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org>). The aim of this 
workshop is to bring together researchers and experts in machine 
learning, data mining, pattern analysis and statistics and create a 
platform for sharing research challenges, as well as advancing the 
research on temporal data analysis. Analysis and learning from temporal 
data covers a wide scope of tasks including learning metrics, learning 
representations, unsupervised feature extraction, clustering, 
classification and interpretation.

Topics of Interest

The workshop welcomes papers that cover, but are not limited to, one or 
several of the following topics:Temporal data clustering

   *
   *

     Classification and regression of univariate and multivariate time 
series

   *

     Early classification of temporal data

   *

     Deep learning for temporal data

   *

     Learning representation for temporal data

   *

     Metric and kernel learning for temporal data

   *

     Modelling temporal dependencies

   *

     Time series forecasting

   *

     Time series annotation, segmentation and anomaly detection

   *

     Spatial-temporal statistical analysis

   *

     Functional data analysis methods

   *

     Data streams

   *

     Interpretable/explainable time-series analysis methods

   *

     Dimensionality reduction, sparsity, algorithmic complexity and big
     data challenges

   *

     Benchmarking and assessment methods for temporal data

   *

     Applications, including bioinformatics, medical, energy consumption,
     etc, on temporaldata.

We welcome contributions that address aspects including, but not limited 
to: novel techniques, innovative use and applications, techniques for 
the use of hybrid models. We also invite papers describing industry time 
series management platforms, in particular those that raise open 
questions for which there are no current off-the-shelf solutions.

Paper Submission

Paper submission is managed through EasyChair 
<https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aaltd22>for the following two 
tracks:

•  Oral presentation

•  Poster session (including research in progress and demos)

Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aaltd22

Authors that would not want their papers to apply for possible oral 
presentation should inform the organisers at the time of submission. 
Submitted papers should be 6 to 16 pages long using the LNCS formatting 
style.

After the workshop, authors of selected papers will be invited for 
publication in a special volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
(LNCS) series (see last year’s edition 
<https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-91445-5>).

Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: June 17, 2022

Paper submission deadline: June 22, 2022

Acceptance notification:  July 13, 2022

Camera-ready deadline: August 10, 2022

Workshop date: September 23, 2022
