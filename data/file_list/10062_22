Bonjour,

Le laboratoire ERIC (Universit=E9 de Lyon) propose un stage destin=E9 =E0=
=20=20
des =E9tudiants en Master Recherche intitul=E9 "Evolution of scientic=20=20
domains: a longitudinal analysis". M=EAme si la description du sujet est=20=
=20
en anglais, l'=E9tudiant =E9voluera dans un milieu mixte francophone et=20=
=20
anglophone. Pouvez-vous communiquer cette proposition =E0 vos =E9tudiants ?

Le sujet est d=E9taill=E9 ci-dessous :

Master Thesis: Evolution of scientic domains: a longitudinal analysis
Supervision: J. Velcin, S. Loudcher
Contact : Julien.Velcin@univ-lyon2.fr
Place: ERIC Lab (University of Lyon)
Duration: 6 months
Funding: ERIC Lab
Subject:
The Web makes the results and discoveries obtained through the=20=20
scientic progress much more
available nowadays than in earlier decades. In particular, scientic=20=20
articles are used by worldwide
teams not only for pursuing their own interests, but also for starting=20=20
new collaborations, creating
special journal issues, and organizing international conferences.=20=20
These events seldom occur randomly:
they are often the result of preliminary works and transversal=20=20
collaborations. Researchers of the ERIC
Lab are currently working on the longitudinal analysis of=20=20
bibliographic data, with a particular interest
in the diagnostics and prediction of such events.
In this context, the student's work will focus on the comparison of=20=20
existing techniques for analyzing
the evolution of the scientic literature. Dierent approaches can be=20=20
tested and the student should
make a full state of the art. This includes, on the one hand, the=20=20
previous works dealing with biblio-
graphic data [5, 7, 11]. On the other hand, she/he could see the topic=20=20
models developed more especially
for text mining [2, 4, 10]. These models are mainly focused on the=20=20
extraction of the main tendencies
but could be extended to deal with events [1, 8]. Several packages are=20=20
freely available nowadays for
testing these probabilistic models (for instance, see Mallet http://mallet.=
cs.umass.edu=20
).
In order to validate the chosen approaches, the student will have=20=20
access to various bibliographic
databases, such as DBLP (http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db)=20=20
or Pascal (http://
www.ovid.com/site/catalog/DataBase/214.jsp). The comparison will be=20=20
based on purely predic-
tive quantitative measures, such as perplexity, but also on human=20=20
judgment [3]. Recent work on topic
extraction evaluation has been done in the lab [6, 9] ; it can be used=20=20
as a start by the student.
The second stage of this internship consists in focusing on one=20=20
interesting event: emergence of a
new topic, publication of an original paper, creation of a new=20=20
community, etc. To begin with, we
propose to follow a purely descriptive approach in order to build an=20=20
explanation of the occurrence of
this particular event. The last stage will draw future lines of=20=20
research for developing new machine
learning models dealing with scientic events. These (future) models=20=20
must be able to handle the
dierent actors who populate a research domain: articles, authors,=20=20
journals, conferences etc.
