                      CALL FOR PAPERS

                        Special Track
                     PRIVACY ON THE WEB
               http://www.privacyontheweb.org

                     March 22 - 26, 2010
                     Sierre, Switzerland

                           at the
        ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2010)
         http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2010



AIMS AND SCOPE
Ubiquity of the internet and its global use by billions of people
put the privacy aspects of the web into a sharp focus. Even though
many well known initiatives concerning privacy, e.g. P3P, EPAL,
APPEL, etc. are now more than ten years old, privacy still attracts
substantial research around the world.

Concerns with privacy issues in our everyday life and in the usage
of the web grow constantly. One inevitably asks what ensures that
the web respects our privacy? Here are some of the basic privacy
questions we may face daily on the web:

  * when we read information on a web site, how can we ensure that
    our privacy is preserved?
  * when we chat on the web, how can we ensure that people we are
    talking to will preserve our privacy?
  * when we search for information with a search engine, how can we
    ensure that traces of our searches will not be used for purposes
    outside our control?
  * when we register on a website, how can we ensure that private
    data will not be disseminated on the web to other parties we do
    not trust?
  * when a service is required by a software component or user, how
    one ensure the web service or the software agent will only use
    the data as promised and will respect the privacy of our data?
  * when we register with a social network, how do we trust that
    the network and its participants will respect the privacy of
    the data we make available?

The goal of this technical track is to investigate methods, techniques
and tools that might help to provide some answers to questions such as
those stated above, in the field of privacy on the web.
The web is understood quite generally, i.e. we invite research in the
fields of distributed systems, multi-agent systems, web services,
web servers, etc.

A non exhaustive list of issues addressed by this technical track
in the context of privacy on the Web is:
Theories             Logics           Proof
Languages            Rules            Specifications
Measures             Reasoning        Management
Machine learning     Data mining      Web mining
Text mining          Preferences      Policies
Personalization      Query languages  XML
Traceability          Watermarking     Role Based Access Control
Ontologies           Semantic Web     Tools
Multi-agent systems  Web services     Case Studies

SAC 2010
For the past twenty-four years, the ACM Symposium on Applied
Computing has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer
scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application
developers from around the world. SAC 2010 is sponsored by the ACM
Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and is hosted
by University of Applied Sciences, Western Switzerland (HES-SO)
and Ecole Polytechnique FÈdÈrale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

PAPER SUBMISSION
Original, unpublished papers from the above-mentioned or other related
areas will be considered. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at
least three referees and undergo a blind review process. Please note that
submission of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed.

The accepted papers will be published in the ACM SAC 2010 proceedings
and in the Digital Library.

Submissions are accepted only in electronic form, through the SAC
web submission system: http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/sac2010

Submissions must follow the template reported here:

Camera-ready papers can be up to 5 pages long according to the
conference template; up to 3 extra pages are allowed, at an
additional fee of 80USD per extra page.

JOURNAL PUBLICATION
Authors of the best papers presented at the conference will be
invited to submit an extended version for publication in a special
issue of the International Journal "Transactions on Data Privacy".

IMPORTANT DATES
Deadline for technical track papers submission: September 15, 2009. 
(EXTENDED !!!)
Notification of Acceptation/Rejection of papers: October 19, 2009.
