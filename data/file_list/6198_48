Titre : Building Multilingual BookNLP

Abstract : BookNLP (Bamman et al. 2014) is a natural language processing =
pipeline for reasoning about the linguistic structure of text in books, =
specifically designed for works of fiction.  In addition to its pipeline =
of part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and coreference =
resolution, BookNLP identifies the characters in a literary text, and =
represents them through the actions they participate in, the objects =
they possess, their attributes, and dialogue.  The availability of this =
tool has driven much work in the computational humanities, especially =
surrounding character (Underwood et al. 2018; Kraicer and Piper 2018; =
Cheng 2020).  At the same time, however, BookNLP has had one major =
limitation: it currently only supports texts written in English.  In =
this talk, I will describe our efforts to expand BookNLP to support =
literature in languages beyond English, and create a blueprint for =
others to develop it for additional languages in the future.

The talk will be followed with a Q/A session on BookNLP

Bio : David Bamman is an associate professor in the School of =
Information at UC Berkeley, where he works in the areas of natural =
language processing and cultural analytics, applying NLP and machine =
learning to empirical questions in the humanities and social sciences. =
His research focuses on improving the performance of NLP for underserved =
domains like literature (including LitBank and BookNLP) and exploring =
the affordances of empirical methods for the study of literature and =
culture. Before Berkeley, he received his PhD in the School of Computer =
Science at Carnegie Mellon University and was a senior researcher at the =
Perseus Project of Tufts University. Bamman=E2=80=99s work is supported =
by the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Science =
Foundation, the Mellon Foundation and an NSF CAREER award.
