                            CALL FOR PAPERS
           First International Workshop on Open Data (WOD-2012)
                      May 25, 2012 - Nantes, France
                 http://sites.google.com/site/opendata2012/

          *** Submission Deadline --- February 29, 2012 ***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----------

While being most commonly known from the recent Linked Open Data movement,
the concept of publishing data explicitly as Open Data has meanwhile develo=
ped
many variants and facets that go beyond publishing large and highly structu=
red
RDF/S repositories. Open Data comprises text and semi-structured data, but =
also
open multi-modal contents, including music, images, and videos. With the in=
creasing
amount of data that is published by governments (see, e.g., data.gov, data.=
gov.uk or
data.gouv.fr), by international organizations (data.worldbank.org or data.u=
ndp.org) and
by scientific communities (tdar.org, cds.u-strasbg.fr, GenBank, IRIS or KNB=
) explicitly
under an Open Data policy, new challenges arise not only due to the scale a=
t which
this data becomes available.

A number of community-based conferences accommodate tracks or workshops whi=
ch
are dedicated to Open Data. However, WOD aims to be a premier venue to gath=
er
researchers and practitioners who are contributing to and interested in the=
 emerging field
of managing Open Data. Hence, it is a unique opportunity to find in a singl=
e place up-to-date
scientific works on Web-scale Open Data issues that have so far only partia=
lly been
addressed by different research communities such as Databases, Data Mining =
and
Knowledge Management, Distributed Systems, Data Privacy, and Data Visualiza=
tion.

The 1st International Workshop on Open Data (WOD) is one of the very first =
events that
stresses new and exciting challenges offered by the emerging field of Open =
Data. It aims at
facilitating new trends and ideas from a broad range of topics concerned wi=
thin the
widely-spread Open Data movement.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
------------------------------

Provided that Open Data is at the heart of the submission, topics of intere=
st for WOD-2012
include, but are not limited to:
	- Big Data Management
	- Data Management in the Cloud
	- Web Data Integration
	- Linked Data and the Semantic Web=20
	- Data Science and Data Analytics
	- Social Web
	- Data Privacy
	- Data Visualization
	- Data Curation
	- Data Provenance

Every submission that jointly covers one or several of the above topics is =
warmly encouraged.
The content of submissions is expected to meet the standards of internation=
al conferences and
workshops. Vision and position papers are specifically welcome.


PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
-----------------------------

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that ar=
e not being considered
for publication in any other forum.=20

Papers submitted cannot exceed six letter-size (8.5" X 11") pages in length=
, including all
references and appendices. Manuscripts are limited to 6 pages, single spaci=
ng, double column,
and must strictly adhere to the template format.  Guidelines  on  paper  su=
bmission  and  formatting
are available  at http://sites.google.com/site/opendata2012/.

Accepted papers will appear in an ePrint arXiv proceedings volume with Open=
 Access.
At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register and pres=
ent his/her work at the workshop.

Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for possible public=
ation as special
issue of a general-purpose journal (e.g. ACM Trans. on the Web or IEEE TKDE=
), or will be compiled into
a formal post-proceedings volume (with a unique ISBN assigned to it) from a=
 Springer-like
publisher.


IMPORTANT DATES
------------------------------

Submissions due on  Feb 29, 2012 (6PM GMT)
Notifications out on  Apr 6, 2012
Camera-ready due on  Apr 22, 2012
Workshop on May 25, 2012
