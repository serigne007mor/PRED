We are looking for a Postdoc to work on the development of new 
sequential machine learning methods for budgeted learning in the context 
of large scale datasets and robotics.

In a world where the amount of produced data is growing exponentially, 
conventional Machine Learning (ML) models should be rethought. They have 
been developed on a centralized paradigm where information can be stored 
on a single computer (or a cluster of computers) and can be processed as 
a whole. Since, ML models have been adapted to the increase of the 
amount of information by using techniques like parallelization or 
sampling that do not directly integrate constraints like CPU or memory 
consumption. Indeed, because the quantity of produced information is 
growing, and because the way we access information is changing, there is 
right now a huge need to propose learning approaches able to integrate 
during learning and inference processes both, how information has to be 
acquired and also realistic budgeted constraints. The post-doc will 
focus on the development of sequential learning models able to 
simultaneously learn which information to acquire for any particular 
task, which representation to build upon the acquired information, and 
to compute a prediction or to learn a particular model depending if our 
sequential model is used ''during training'' or ''during inference'' 
under a set of budgeted constraints. Applications to recommender systems 
and robotics will be developed.
The position is funded by a national research project (Onbul Project 
http://onbul.lip6.fr) for one year + one possible additional year.

The successful candidate will join the machine learning and information 
access team of the University Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France, led 
by Prof. Patrick Gallinari, and will also be associated with the 
Robotics Institute. The post-doc will be supervised by Prof. Ludovic 
Denoyer. Our research explores a number of different issues such as: 
representation learning for relational data, for dynamics data, 
reinforcement learning, deep neural networks. For a more detailed 
description the interested candidates may take a look at: 
http://www.lip6.fr/~denoyer/ <http://www.lip6.fr/%7Edenoyer/> and the 
list of publications within there. The University Pierre et Marie Curie 
is referenced as the first French university in the academic ranking of 
international universities. It offers considerable opportunities for 
training and exposure to data mining and machine learning, with a number 
of research teams being active on these and related fields. In addition 
the selected candidate will have ample opportunities to participate in 
the main ML conferences.
