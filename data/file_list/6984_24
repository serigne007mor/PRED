Dear colleagues and friends,

Following up previous information on the RCIS 2015 conference, we would like to draw your attention to the following specialized events that will be part of the conference: the Doctoral Consortium, the Posters and Demos session and the Tutorials.

We are looking forward to receiving your paper and meeting you in Athens!

The RCIS 2015 Conference Committee


*DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM*
The RCIS 2015 Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear topic and research approach, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. In addition to stating how you will gain from participation, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium.

*Important dates*
Submission deadline: February 22, 2015 (23:59 Central European Time)
Author notification: March 31, 2015
Camera-ready deadline: April 15, 2015

Call for Doctoral Consortium Papers:http://rcis-conf.us9.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=91730dbf75f78edaf6f1585be&id=e4791de594&e=1273991b94

*Chairs*
Maya Daneva, University of Twente, The Netherlands
Cherifa Mansoura, Senior Consultant Methodologist, Canada
Renata Guizzardi, Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo, Brasil


*POSTERS AND DEMOS*
RCIS will feature posters in a poster session and offer the opportunity for demonstrations of tools in a demonstration session. Both sessions will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to showcase their work, to interact with conference participants, and to obtain feedback on on-going research and advanced prototypes and products from knowledgeable conference attendees:

- Posters are intended to convey a research result and are not advertisements for commercial software packages. While posters need not describe completed work, they should report on research for which at least some preliminary results are available.
- Demonstrations should directly and actively involve the exhibition and display of software prototypes, research tools and associated materials that illustrate research work in progress and serve as ground for discussion of research ideas.

*Important dates*
Posters and Demos submission deadline: February 22, 2015 (23:59 Central European Time)
Author notification: March 31, 2015
Camera-ready deadline: April 15, 2015

Call for Posters and Demos:http://rcis-conf.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=91730dbf75f78edaf6f1585be&id=7a1784d5c2&e=1273991b94

*Chairs*
Saïd Assar, Mines-Telecom Institute, France
Rim Kaabi, University of Manouba, Tunisia


*TUTORIALS*
RCIS will feature several tutorials. Tutorials are 90 minutes free format sessions, where the presenter(s) share(s) a specific and top of the art practical know-how to conference attendees that are willing to participate. Tutorials run in parallel with other conference tracks, and participation is included in the attendees’ conference fee. We invite proposals for tutorials that may address one or more of the listed topics below, although authors should not feel limited by them.

*Important dates*
Tutorial submission deadline: February 22, 2015 (23:59 Central European Time)
Tutorial notification: March 31, 2015

Call for Tutorials:http://rcis-conf.us9.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=91730dbf75f78edaf6f1585be&id=9657fd7150&e=1273991b94

*Chairs*
Sergio España, Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain
Dejan Lavbic, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia
