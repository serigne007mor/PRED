The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining series (ICDM) has
established itself as the world's premier research conference in data
mining. ICDM '12 provides a leading international forum for the
presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and
dissemination of innovative ideas, drawing researchers and
practitioners from a wide range of data mining related areas such as
statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases,
visualization, and high performance computing. By promoting novel,
high quality research findings, and innovative solutions to
challenging data mining problems, the conference seeks to continuously
advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. Besides the technical
program, the conference will feature invited talks from research and
industry leaders, as well as workshops, tutorials, panels, and the
ICDM data mining contest.

Paper Submissions
*****************

We invite high quality submissions on all aspects of data mining and
knowledge discovery. Papers should be original and innovative,
rigorously evaluated and well-presented. Broad areas of interest
include, but are not limited to (see
http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/Topics.shtml for a more detailed list of
topics):

  * Novel Algorithms
  * Theory and Foundations
  * Systems and Frameworks
  * Innovative Applications
  * Large-scale Approaches

All submitted papers will be judged based on their significance,
originality, repeatability, and clarity.  Substantially similar papers
that have already been accepted, or are simultaneously under review
during the ICDM review period will not be considered. Papers will be
triple-blind reviewed and should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages.
Papers that do not comply with the Submission Guidelines (available at
http://icdm2012.ua.ac.be) will be rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the
IEEE Computer Society Press. Regular paper will be allocated 10 pages
in the proceedings, and longer oral presentation time, whereas short
papers will be allowed 6 pages in the proceedings, with shorter oral
presentation time.  A selected number of IEEE ICDM '12 top-ranked
papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in expanded and revised
form, in the Knowledge and Information Systems journal
(http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~kais/) published by Springer.

Repeatability Guidelines: To ensure the long term viability of data
mining research, every effort should be made to provide the
source-code (or executables), as well as the datasets (or their
closest publicly available equivalents). The experimental results
section should mention all relevant implementation details and
parameter specifications, so that the results can be independently
duplicated.

The ICDM '12 paper review system is at
http://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2012/icdm12/scripts/submit.php

ICDM Best Paper Awards
**********************

IEEE ICDM Best Paper Awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper, (2) the best application
paper, and (3) the best student paper. Strong, foundational results
will be considered for the best research paper award and
application-oriented submissions will be considered for the best
application paper award. A best student paper award will also be
given.

Tutorials
*********

ICDM '12 will host short and long tutorials that focus on new research
directions and initiatives. The deadline for submission of tutorial
proposals is August 10, 2012.

Workshops
*********

ICDM '12 will host short and long workshops that focus on new research
directions and initiatives. All accepted workshop papers will be
included in a separate workshop proceedings published by the IEEE
Computer Society Press.

The deadline for workshop proposals is April 6, 2012.  The deadline
for Workshop paper submissions is August 10, 2012.

ICDM Data Mining Contest
************************

ICDM '12 will host a data mining contest to challenge researchers and
practitioners with a real practical data mining problem.

ICDM Data Mining Demos
**********************

ICDM '12 will host demos. Demos are solicited for demonstrating data
mining software systems and libraries closely related to the area of
data mining and knowledge discovery, or showing new technological
advances in applying data mining techniques. The deadline for demo
submissions is August 10, 2012.

Student Travel Scholarships
***************************

A selected number of student travel scholarships will be available to
support student authors to attend ICDM '12 to present their
papers. The student travel scholarship committee will make the final
decision for the final awarded students. In general, US$500 to US$1000
will be awarded to each successful applicant.
