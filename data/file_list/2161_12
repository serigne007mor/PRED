We cordially invite you to submit your contribution to the Twelfth IEEE Int=
ernational Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI 2024) that will take =
place June 3-6, 2024, in Orlando, Florida, United States of America.=20

IEEE ICHI 2024 is a premier community forum concerned with the application =
of computer science, information science, data science, and informatics pri=
nciples, as well as information technology, and communication science and t=
echnology to address problems and support research in healthcare, medicine,=
 life science, public health, and everyday wellness. The conference highlig=
hts the most novel technical contributions to stakeholder-centered technolo=
gy innovation for benefiting human health and the related social and ethica=
l implications.=20

We strongly encourage authors to submit their original contributions descri=
bing their algorithmic, methodological or empirical contributions, and theo=
ries relevant to the broader context of health informatics. Submissions can=
 focus on one or more specific aspects of theory, design, development, eval=
uation, or deployment. IEEE ICHI 2023 has three main tracks for paper submi=
ssions: analytics, human factors, and systems:=20

Analytics track : In the Analytics track, we invite submissions on novel me=
thods for exploring and analyzing healthcare data such as biomedical patter=
n recognition, biomarker discovery, disease profiling and personalized trea=
tment, natural language processing and text mining, recommender systems, cl=
inical phenotyping, visual analytics, explainability, and epidemiological m=
odeling.=20

Human Factors track : Contributions in the realm of Human Factors may inclu=
de empirical studies on the use and needs of health information technology =
in everyday life, socio-technical studies on the implementation and utiliza=
tion of health information technology in clinical settings, investigations =
into the community-level impact and implications of health informatics, des=
ign and evaluative efforts centered on innovative user-centered health info=
rmation technology, as well as empirical research on public policies that l=
everage health informatics infrastructures.=20

Systems track : The Systems track welcomes submissions related to the desig=
n, development, deployment, and evaluation of high-performing, privacy-pres=
erving and secure software or hardware systems. In particular, the Systems =
track invites submissions on the development of large language model (LLM) =
applications, such as ChatGPT, their utilization in clinical settings, and =
the strengths and limitations of LLMs in enhancing the efficiency and effec=
tiveness of clinical research, education, and practice.=20

Submission=20
The conference will accept both regular and short papers. Papers should be =
submitted following instructions at https://ieeeichi2024.github.io/. Paper =
submissions must adhere to the IEEE Proceedings Format (details will be pub=
lished soon). Please see the respective calls for publication opportunities=
 such as posters, demos, the industry track, workshops, tutorials, and the =
doctoral consortium.=20

Reviewing=20
ICHI uses a single-blind, two-layer peer-reviewing process. The final decis=
ion will be made by the program chair of each track based on at least three=
 reviews by program committee members and one metareview by senior program =
committee members.=20

Presentation and Publication=20
All submissions will be published in IEEE Xplore and indexed in other Abstr=
acting and Indexing (A&I) databases. Accepted papers have an oral presentat=
ion slot at the conference. Selected papers will be invited to submit the e=
xtended version to the Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research, and a fa=
st-track review will be conducted for the extended papers.=20

Important Dates=20
- Submission deadline: January 21st, 2024=20
- Notification of acceptance: March 7th, 2024=20
