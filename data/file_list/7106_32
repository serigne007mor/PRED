The 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IATï¿½11) is a premier event for the Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent community. The field continues to experience
rapid growth both in academia and industry. The industry day of the conference aims to bring together people from both academia and industry in a venue that highlights application and practical impact.
We invite the submission of industry papers. The papers will be included in the main conference proceedings. The paper speakers will be invited to participate in a panel. All participants of the conference are invited
to attend the industry day event.

Industry Paper Requirement

All areas of the WI/IAT conference are of interest to the industry papers. The paper should be about industrial or other real-world applications of WI/IAT. A description of how the application has been conceived, developed and
deployed must be provided. The industry papers will be 4 pages in length including the bibliography, and must be submitted online at the conference websites. The submission must satisfy the style requirement as specified in IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines. At least one author of each Industry-Track paper should be from an industrial company or organization. The papers must indicate which track (WI or IAT) the authors would like to include their papers. All papers submitted to the Industry Track will also be reviewed by the Program Committee and the accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
