 AIM AND SCOPE

 Environmental and more generally geo-spatial information is now 
 provided by crowdsourcing but also by public administrations in the 
 context of the open data policies. Analyses of such data are still 
 challenging. Firstly because of their heterogeneity (structural, 
 semantic, spatial and temporal), and secondly because of the difficulty 
 in choosing the “best” knowledge discovery process to apply, according 
 to the needs of the experts in the field. This special session aims at 
 discussing and assessing some of these strategies covering all or part 
 of the issues mentioned above, from a theoretical or experimental point 
 of view.

 TOPICS

 - Pre and Post Data processing
 - Data Quality, Result Evaluation
 - Data Mining or Data Warehousing Applications
 - Text Mining
 - Visual Analytics
 - KDD real use-cases

 dedicated to environmental and geo-spatial Data

 PAPER SUBMISSION

 - Papers should be submitted by DSAA submission site choosing Special 
 Session on "Environmental and geo-spatial data analytics (EnGeoData)" 
 before 22nd July 2014 (PST).
 - Conference paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of seven 
 (7) pages, in the IEEE 2-column format (see the IEEE Proceedings Author 
 Guidelines: 
 http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
 ).
 - All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on 
 the basis of technical quality, relevance to conference topics of 
 interest, originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and 
 affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic 
 references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity.
 - Accepted conference papers will be published in the conference 
 proceedings by IEEE and included into the IEEE Xplore Digital Library 
 and will be submitted for EI indexing through INSPEC by IEEE.
