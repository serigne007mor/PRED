Subject: [liste-egc] Call for applications | Postdoctoral position @
 OpenCEMS Industrial Chair (deadline: June 25th, 2022)

Please, consider sharing this call for postdoc among colleagues, post-docs =
and last-year PhD students=2E

*** CONTEXT AND MAIN PURPOSE ***

The Connected Environment & Distributed Energy Data Management Solutions (O=
penCEMS) industrial chair addresses the issues that businesses and communit=
ies encounter when handling data management in their connected environments=
=2E The OpenCEMS research group aims at designing, implementing and deployi=
ng software solutions within Small and Large Scale Distributed/Connected En=
vironments for better data collection/aggregation, information retrieval, a=
nd knowledge extraction=2E

*** DESCRIPTION OF THE POSTDOC ACTIVITIES ***

This postdoctoral fellowship's global objective is to design and develop hy=
brid information retrieval which uses the semantics of data (i=2Ee=2E, Onto=
logies, terminologies, dictionaries), community preferences as well as coll=
aborative filtering techniques for semantic information retrieval=2E The id=
ea is to improve the accuracy by applying topic modeling for the corpus rat=
her than dealing with the documents as bag of words to capture the hidden r=
elationships between the words in order to group words into specific topics=
, and then expand the query to explore and discovery hidden relations betwe=
en documents=2E

=B7	The Postdoc aims to investigate different techniques for discovering th=
e topics that occur in a collection of documents, and then to expand the qu=
ery by using Automatic Query Expansion=2E The approach should consider five=
 aspects:
o	Exploring the use of advanced Semantic Web tools to problems in Informati=
on Retrieval (IR)=2E
o	Investigating approaches to discover the abstract "topics" that occur in =
a collection of documents based on topic model approaches and then expand t=
he query to explore and discover hidden relations between the documents=
=2E
o	Demonstrating that classifying the corpus with meaningful descriptive inf=
ormation using topic modeling techniques can improve the results of IR meth=
ods=2E
o	Combining topic model and query expansion and apply to corpus documents=
=2E
o	Identifying personalized search results generation and hence improve the =
relatedness of the research results using topic modeling techniques togethe=
r with topic-driven based community detection methods=2E
=B7	The postdoc is required to provide support to ongoing PhD student proje=
cts, and activities that evolve around the same research area=2E
=B7	The postdoc will be also involved in small load teaching activities rel=
ated to Computer Science subjects=2E



*** REQUIREMENTS ***
=B7	The candidate should hold a PhD in Computer Science=2E His/her work sho=
uld be related to ontology learning and topic modeling techniques=2E
=B7	Proven experience in Knowledge representation, document classification,=
 Topic modeling algorithms and Topic extraction=2E
=B7	Excellent scripting and coding skills=2E
=B7	Excellent Communication skills
=B7	Autonomous and team working capabilities=2E

*** OFFER DETAILS ***
=B7	The postdoc will have the opportunity to work in a research group that =
gathers academic, and industrial partners=2E This environment allows the po=
stdoc to participate in research gatherings, conferences, and visiting/work=
ing in different environments (e=2Eg=2E, in a research lab, partner institu=
tions, and companies)=2E
=B7	Contract duration: 12 months (with a contract extension possibility)=
=2E
=B7	Gross Salary: 2300-2600 euros/month (depending on the candidate's profi=
le)
=B7	Main host institution: LIUPPA/OpenCEMS research group=2E

*** APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS ***

Please send your applications (in PDF format) to the following contacts: ri=
chard=2Echbeir@univ-pau=2Efr
The application (written in English) should include:
=B7	A Curriculum Vitae (including your contact address, work experience, pu=
blications, software repositories)
=B7	A cover letter
=B7	Two recommendation letters
=B7	Two of your best publications/implementations

Deadline for applications: June 25th 2022=2E
Start date: September 1st, 2022 (negotiable)=2E

Screening of applications starts immediately and will continue until a cand=
idate is selected=2E Therefore, early applications are encouraged=2E
