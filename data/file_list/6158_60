Workshop on AI, Regulation and Decision Making


* 17h -- Thierry Poibeau (CNRS & ENS-PSL): Welcome and Introduction

* 17h05 -- Anita Burgun (Universit=C3=A9 Paris Cit=C3=A9, HEGP and =
Necker Hospital): Augmented intelligence vs AI to support health =
decision making

Abstract: Several AI-based applications have been recently suspended for =
giving harmful advice. To avoid this kind of problem in the future, =
medical doctors are now asking for augmented intelligence to involve =
medical experts in the algorithms' development, and for the integration =
of human knowledge in order to enhance the accuracy in decision making

Anita Burgun is Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Universit=C3=A9 =
Paris Cit=C3=A9, and works at HEGP and Necker Hospital. She is a fellow =
of the AI PR[AI]RIE Institute where she leads a program on AI for rare =
diseases


* 17h35 -- Franziska Poszler  (Institute for Ethics in AI at the =
Technical University of Munich): The impact of decision-support systems =
on humans=E2=80=99 ethical decision-making

Abstract: With the rise and public accessibility of AI-enabled =
decision-support systems, individuals outsource increasingly more of =
their decisions, even those that carry ethical dimensions. This =
presentation will summarize one of our working papers in which we =
conducted a systematic literature review to illustrate how =
decision-support systems shape humans=E2=80=99 ethical decision-making =
on an individual and societal level.

Franziska Poszler is a PhD student and research associate at the Chair =
of Business Ethics and the Institute for Ethics in AI at the Technical =
University of Munich, Germany.=20


* 18h05 -- Thierry Poibeau (CNRS & ENS-PSL): Some comments on the notion =
of bias in AI

Abstract: A major source of concerns for ethical AI and for a fair =
representation of people is the notion of bias. In this talk, we show =
that while a lot of research has been devoted to removing bias in data, =
this notion is not always precisely defined, which leads to difficulties =
and misunderstanding so as what automatic systems can do.=20

Thierry Poibeau is a CNRS Research Director working at the Ecole normale =
sup=C3=A9rieure. He is a fellow of the AI PR[AI]RIE Institute where he =
develops research on natural language processing and digital humanities.=20=



* 18h30 -- Debate on the regulation of AI in view of the AI act, with =
the different speakers and with Prof. C L=C3=BCtge (Director of the TUM =
Institute for Ethics in AI, a member of the Scientific Board of the =
European AI Ethics initiative AI4People as well as of the German Ethics =
Commission on Automated and Connected Driving)
