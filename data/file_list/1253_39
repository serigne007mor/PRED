Eurographics / IEEE-VGTC EuroVis Conference
June 9-11 2010, Bordeaux, France

Building on the success of past Eurographics - IEEE VGTC Symposia on 
Visualization, we invite you to participate in the twelfth Eurographics 
/ IEEE-VGTC EuroVis Conference. The venue for 2010 is Bordeaux, France. 
The Bordeaux University enjoys a strong cultural background in computer 
science and has recently experienced a burst of development involving 
institutional partners such as CNRS and INRIA.

The city of Bordeaux was added to Unesco's World Heritage based on its 
exceptionnal urban ensemble. It has grown into a city of commerce and 
exchange because of its location along the Garonne river opening on the 
Atlantic ocean.  Participants will have the opportunity to visit and 
enjoy Saint-Emilion, sitting at the heart of one of the most well known 
worldwide vineyard.

The symposium features 48 papers reporting significant new research 
results, and case studies on the practical application of visualization 
in data analysis. The conference also hosts the one-day EuroVAST 
workshop as a co-located event, taking place on Tue June 8, 2010.

Important dates: Feb 17 2010: Early registration starts / Apr 30 2010: 
Early registration ends
