THERE IS STILL TIME TO SUBMIT A POSTER TO EHEALTH 2009!

 

eHealth 2009: 2nd International Conference on electronic healthcare Patients or Users - who are we developing services for?

http://www.electronic-health.org/

23rd-25th September 2009 - Istanbul, Turkey

 

CONFERENCE AIMS

Building on a very successful eHealth 2008 conference, the aim of eHealth 2009 is to bring together experts from academia, industry and global healthcare institutions to stimulate cutting- edge research discussions and share experience with real-world healthcare service providers and policy makers as well as provide numerous business opportunities.

 

Despite substantial budgets spent on eHealth in recent years, existing healthcare services do not sufficiently address the issue of patient privacy, trust, or quality-assurance, nor the potential in e-learning and web mining for delivering 21st-century healthcare systems for European citizens. 

The key topic of eHealth 2009 is investigating a realistic potential of the Internet in providing evidence-based medical advice and quality-assured education for patients to improve the wellbeing of European and global citizens.

 

CONFERENCE TOPICS

1. Privacy, Trust and Security - electronic patient records, models for trust and privacy, novel mobile encryption technologies, identity federation, role based access control, privacy enhancing technologies.

2. Epidemiology and Early Warning Systems and Outbreak Detection - information and IT support systems for early warning and outbreak detection programs, data management issues, data collection and analysis for surveillance and epidemiology.

3. Healthcare Ontologies and Knowledge Management Systems - annotation, health care ontologies, coding standards, communication standards, quality tagging and quality of service, distribution issues, coding systems and ontologies mapping, search, user customisation, alert agents.

4. E-learning, Educational Games and the Impact of Information Delivery to Patients and Professionals - using Digital Libraries in building online communities, moderated discussion groups, qualitative and quantitative evaluation studies, user attitude towards the knowledge, studies of changes of user attitude with respect to digital libraries.

5. Web 2.0 in Healthcare, Wellbeing and Online Communities Of Practice - Community of practice, Web 2.0, user support groups, blogs, online support for healthy lifestyles, wellbeing and public interventions.
