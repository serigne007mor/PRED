KEYNOTE SPEAKER
We are honoured to welcome *Anind K. Dey* (Human-Computer Interaction 
Institute, Carnegie Mellon University) to the WIVE'10 workshop for an 
invited talk.

SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP
Internet is a medium allowing services and information exchange in an 
open and decentralized environment, notably with numerous applications 
for virtual enterprises. It concerns enterprise information systems, 
local, regional and governmental organizations but it also involves more 
and more common users in the so-called web 2.0. The main stake is to use 
Internet as a technological support to communication, information 
exchange, service composition personalisation and access by all and 
anywhere. In this perspective, some work has been done these last years 
to combine classical techniques of information management with 
artificial intelligence technologies thus creating a new research domain 
called Web Intelligence. Research in Web Intelligence contributes to the 
development of algorithms, models and tools to handle the social and 
economic impact of the web usages.
The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for 
researchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative 
networks, such as virtual enterprises and organizations. The 
possibilities and consequences of the web usage for collaborative 
networks are tremendous and new tools are required to satisfy users and 
service providers. Thus, Web Intelligence brings new research problems 
related to information and service access, quality of service, 
personalization, privacy preserving, trust as well as other issues.
The workshop Web Intelligence and Virtual Enterprises (VE) expects 
contributions on topics such as:
• Multi-agent models and tools for VE
• Services and Grid Services for VE, Service oriented architectures
• Web information mining, filtering and retrieval within/for VE
• Web-based applications and plate-forms for VE
• Intelligent web interaction, querying, diffusion
• Semantics and ontology engineering for VE
• Self-* models and techniques for VE
• Social networks modelling, virtual communities, social intelligence
• Context-based approach, profile management, personalization and 
recommendations for/through VE
• Privacy preserving, security, trust-based computing & reputation systems
• Applications: E-* (market, procurement, technologies, health, 
government, etc.) and VE
• VE and content and knowledge repositories, behaviour modelling and 
exchange
• Web intelligence, mobility and VE, Ambient Intelligence, Pervasive 
computing
• Performances evaluation, experiments, user feed-back
• Surveys on WI and VE
The organization of the Web Intelligence & Virtual Enterprises workshop 
at PRO-VE'10 is supported by the Web Intelligence project from the 
French Rhône-Alpes regional cluster ISLE.

SUBMISSIONS
The Web Intelligence and Virtual Enterprises workshop welcomes the 
submission of theoretical, experimental, methodological as well as 
application papers. Papers may report on completed work, descriptions of 
work in progress or discussion papers.
Submitted papers will undergo a thorough review process. Papers will be 
published into the CD-Rom of the conference. In addition, a selection of 
the workshop papers will be published as post-proceedings in a special 
issue of the International Journal of Web Intelligence and Agent Systems 
(http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=15701263).
Submitted papers should be 16 pages maximum in length, including figures 
and references. The paper must be formatted according to the double 
column style guidelines for A4 papers available here: 
http://wi-consortium.org/wias/submissionInst.html
All papers should be prepared in pdf format and submitted on the web site
