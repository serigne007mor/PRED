Subject: [liste-egc] Call for Papers - IDA 2023 deadline 15/11


IDA 2023
2023-04-12 => 2022-11-30
Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium

The 21st International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis will take 
place April 12-14, 2023 in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

https://ida2023.org

Authors are invited to submit original contributions on the topic of 
intelligent data analysis. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over 
performance. Thus, while each contribution should contain some 
theoretical or empirical evaluation, exhaustive evaluation is not 
required as long as a convincing and solid motivation is given.

Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process (author 
identities are known to reviewers). The conventional reviewing process, 
which favors incremental advances on established work, can discourage 
the kinds of papers that IDA 2023 aims to publish. The reviewing process 
will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers on the 
basis of novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. 
Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior 
program committee members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing 
argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted 
independent of the overall review score.

All accepted paper contributions will be published in the Lecture Notes 
in Computer Science series by Springer-Verlag. Proceedings from previous 
IDA symposia have appeared in the same series over the last two decades.

It is required that at least one author of each accepted paper registers 
for the conference and presents and discusses the contribution at the 
conference.

*Formatting instructions*

Contributions, written in English, must be formatted according to the 
guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by 
Springer-Verlag, which are available together with templates here: 
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines. 
We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page limit 
for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and 
appendices, is 10-12 pages in LNCS format. Submission of the 
camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to 
publish on the above Springer LNCS website.

Authors may not submit any paper which is under review elsewhere or 
which has been accepted for publication in a journal or another 
conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the 
review period of IDA 2023.

*Submission*

Papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, via the IDA 2023 
EasyChair submission website 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ida2023).

*Important dates*

Paper submission deadline: November 15, 2022
Notification of acceptance: January 20, 2023
All dates are specified as 23:59:59 SST (Standard Samoa Time / Anywhere 
on Earth)
