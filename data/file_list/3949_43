=3D=3D=3D tl;dr =3D=3D=3D
The Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshop series at =
ECIR tackles issues related to academic search, at the intersection =
between Information Retrieval and Bibliometrics.  BIR is a hot topic =
investigated by both academia (e.g., ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX) and the =
industry (e.g., Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Semantic =
Scholar). A one-day workshop is to be held with ECIR 2021.

An overview of the BIR/BIRNDL workshop series can be found at =
https://sites.google.com/view/bir-ws/home. Past BIR(NDL) proceedings are =
online https://dblp.org/search?q=3DBIR.ECIR as open access.

=3D=3D=3D Workshop Topics =3D=3D=3D
We welcome (but are not limited to) submissions regarding the aspects of =
academic search below:

 - Information seeking & searching with scientific information, such as:
     . Finding relevant papers/authors for a literature review.
     . Measuring the degree of plagiarism in a paper.
     . Identifying expert reviewers for a given submission.
     . Flagging predatory conferences and journals.
     . Information seeking behaviour and human-computer interaction in =
academic search.

 - Mining the scientific literature, such as:
     . Information extraction, text mining and parsing of scholarly =
literature.
     . Natural language processing (e.g., citation contexts).
     . Discourse modelling and argument mining.

 - Academic search/recommender systems, such as:
     . Modelling the multifaceted nature of scientific information.
     . Building test collections for reproducible BIR.
     . System support for literature search and recommendation.

 - Dataset development for bibliographic research

We especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work =
as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple =
themes directly are especially welcome.
