CALL FOR PAPERS

2nd International Workshop on WEB INTELLIGENCE & VIRTUAL ENTERPRISES
(WIVE'10)
http://www.emse.fr/wive/

to be held at the 11th IFIP Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises
(PRO-VE'10)
Saint-Etienne, France, October 11-13, 2010

*Important Dates*

Paper submission deadline: March 30th, 2010
Paper notification : May 15th, 2010
Camera ready paper : June 13th, 2010
Workshop : October 12-13th, 2010
Journal Paper submission deadline : November 15th, 2010
Journal Acceptance notification : January 15th, 2011

*KEYNOTE SPEAKER*

We are honoured to welcome Anind Dey (Human-Computer Interaction
Institute, Carnegie Mellon University) to the WIVE'10 workshop for an
invited talk.

*JOURNAL PUBLICATION FOR POST-PROCEEDINGS*

A selection of an extended version of workshop papers will be published
as post-proceedings in a special issue of the International Journal of
Web Intelligence and Agent Systems
(http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=15701263).

*SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP*

Internet is a medium allowing services and information exchange in an
open and decentralized environment, notably with numerous applications
for virtual enterprises. It concerns enterprise information systems,
local, regional and governmental organizations but it also involves more
and more common users in the so-called web 2.0. The main stake is to use
Internet as a technological support to communication, information
exchange, service composition personalisation and access by all and
anywhere. In this perspective, some work has been done these last years
to combine classical techniques of information management with
artificial intelligence technologies thus creating a new research domain
called Web Intelligence. Research in Web Intelligence contributes to the
development of algorithms, models and tools to handle the social and
economic impact of the web usages.

The workshop will provide presentation and discussion opportunities for
researchers working on web intelligence applied to collaborative
networks, such as virtual enterprises and organizations. The
possibilities and consequences of the web usage for collaborative
networks are tremendous and new tools are required to satisfy users and
service providers. Thus, Web Intelligence brings new research problems
related to information and service access, quality of service,
personalization, privacy preserving, trust as well as other issues.

The workshop Web Intelligence and Virtual Enterprises (VE) expects
contributions on topics such as:

   * Multi-agent models and tools for VE
   * Services and Grid Services for VE, Service oriented architectures
   * Web information mining, filtering and retrieval within/for VE
   * Web-based applications and plate-forms for VE
   * Intelligent web interaction, querying, diffusion
   * Semantics and ontology engineering for VE
   * Self-* models and techniques for VE
   * Social networks modelling, virtual communities, social intelligence
   * Context-based approach, profile management, personalization and
recommendations for/through VE
   * Privacy preserving, security, trust-based computing & reputation
systems
   * Applications: E-* (market, procurement, technologies, health,
government, etc.) and VE
   * VE and content and knowledge repositories, behaviour modelling and
exchange
   * Web intelligence, mobility and VE, Ambient Intelligence, Pervasive
computing
   * Performances evaluation, experiments, user feed-back
   * Surveys on WI and VE

The organization of the Web Intelligence & Virtual Enterprises workshop
at PRO-VE'10 is supported by the Web Intelligence project from the
French Rhône-Alpes regional cluster ISLE.

*SUBMISSIONS*

The Web Intelligence and Virtual Enterprises workshop welcomes the
submission of theoretical, experimental, methodological as well as
application papers. Papers may report on completed work, descriptions of
work in progress or discussion papers.

Submitted papers will undergo a thorough review process. Papers will be
published into the CD-Rom of the conference. In addition, a selection of
the workshop papers will be published as post-proceedings in a special
issue of the International Journal of Web Intelligence and Agent Systems
(http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=15701263).

Submitted papers should be 16 pages maximum in length, including figures
and references. The paper must be formatted according to the double
column style guidelines for A4 papers available here:
http://wi-consortium.org/wias/submissionInst.html

All papers should be prepared in pdf format and submitted on the web site
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wive2010
