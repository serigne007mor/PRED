Subject: [liste-egc] Last Call for Papers: ISMIS 2014 Special Session on
 Cooperativeness and Flexibility in Semantic Web Databases

(with apologies for cross postings)
=====================================================================================================
ISMIS 2014 Conference
Roskilde, Denmark, June 25-27, 2014

A SPECIAL SESSION:

Cooperativeness and Flexibility in Semantic Web Databases

ORGANIZERS:

Allel Hadjali (allel.hadjali@ensma.fr), LIAS/ENSMA, Poitiers, France
Stéphane Jean (stephane.jean@ensma.fr), LIAS/ENSMA - Poitiers 
University, Poitiers, France
Peter Dolog (dolog@cs.aau.dk ), IWIS-DCS/Aalborg University, Denmark

SCOPE:

With the increased use of the Semantic Web and the emergence of new 
applications (such as in bioinformatics, environment and medicine) 
requiring data models that support complex relationships and rich 
constructs, a huge amount of RDF data are produced and several data sets 
are made available on the Web (e.g, YAGO or DBpedia). To provide an 
efficient management of these data, specialized databases called 
Semantic Web Databases (SWDBs) have been designed.
SWDBs have attracted the attention and the interest of both scientific 
and industrial communities leading to the development of products such 
as Oracle Semantic Technologies or Jena.

Some of the most crucial challenges that modern-day SWDBs have to face 
are related to the massive data (which can be heterogeneous, imprecise, 
uncertain, incomplete and/or inconsistent) and to the complex and 
diverse nature of users' needs (which can be imprecise, partially known 
and ill-expressed). Thus, it is highly desirable that such systems 
should, on the one hand, show some advanced forms of flexibility and, on 
the other hand, exhibit capabilities of cooperative and intelligent 
behaviors.

Flexibility in such a context might be intended in several ways; among 
which the following ones: (i) the capability of querying large amount of 
data in a user-friendly way so as to retrieve the information which is 
the most relevant to specific user needs; (ii) the capability of 
managing and exploiting imprecise, partially known, and uncertain data.

As for cooperativeness, one might think to the ability of such systems 
to provide correct, non-misleading and useful answers, rather than 
literal answers to users' queries. Answers that, on the one hand, better 
serve the users' needs and expectations and, on the other hand, do not 
result in a tedious and time consuming task when selecting the best 
ones. Avoiding thus the common problem of the empty/unsatisfactory 
answers and that of the too many results.

This special session will provide an opportunity to exchange ideas and 
to discuss recent theoretical and experimental results on the two above 
research topics in the context of Semantic Web Databases. Hopefully, it 
will contribute to identifying new promising directions of research and 
unsolved problems in this area.

We invite contributions that address the following areas, but are not 
limited to:

-    Query relaxation/intensification
-    Empty/plethoric answers problem
-    Cooperative and intelligent query answering
-    Flexible/personalized querying
-    Managing incomplete/missing data
-    Soft computing applied to semantic Web databases
-    Dealing with large semantic datasets in cooperative and flexible way

We encourage submissions of papers, which have not been published or 
submitted to any other conference, about theoretical advances in these 
core areas as well as papers which deal with some practical insights 
resulting from experiments or implementations.

The same deadline as for the regular papers to be submitted to the ISMIS 
2014 will be observed, i.e. February 17, 2014 
(http://isl.ruc.dk/ismis2014/index.php). However, the potential 
contributors are requested to send at their earliest convenience an 
e-mail message, addressed to allel.hadjali@ensma.fr or to 
dolog@cs.aau.dkc, confirming the intent to submit a paper and giving its 
tentative title and a list of the authors.

Submitted papers must comply with the ISMIS 2014 guidelines for 
submission (http://isl.ruc.dk/ismis2014/paper_submission/). They will be 
reviewed by three special session PC members. The accepted papers will 
be published in the main conference proceedings.
