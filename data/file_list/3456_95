Dear colleagues,

The submission deadline for CAp 2022 is extended until April 8: 
https://caprfiap2022.sciencesconf.org/

Here is the call for paper:
------------------------------------------------------
CAp is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection 
of machine learning, applied mathematics, and related areas.

The *submission website* can be found here 
<https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cap2022>.
Submitted papers can be either in English or in French and we encourage 
two types of submissions:

     - Full research papers on the theme of machine learning theory and 
its applications should not exceed *10 pages in CAp double-column 
format* (including references and figures). A suitable LaTeX *template* 
for CAp is available here 
<https://caprfiap2022.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/cap2022_template.zip>.
     - Short papers can be *up to four to 6 pages* using the same format 
as the full papers. They present original ideas and provide an 
opportunity to describe significant work in progress.

We also encourage the submission of *recent *(2021 or 2022)*papers 
accepted* to high level conferences and journals in *machine learning*. 
These papers will also be reviewed (lightly) by the program committee. 
If accepted, they will be presented at the conference but will not 
appear in any (online) proceedings. Note that, in this particular case, 
the paper can be submitted in the original conference format (length and 
style) and the reviews given by the conference/ML journal where it was 
accepted should be included as the first pages of the submission in 
addition to a link to the corresponding conference/ML journal web page. 
The submission of the reviews and the original paper should be merged 
and submitted into a single PDF file on the easychair website 
<https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cap2022>.

Some accepted papers will be presented in a *long* (20 minutes) oral 
presentation and all the accepted papers will be given the opportunity 
to be presented as a spotlight (3 minutes) and as a poster at the 
conference. These presentations are an opportunity to have constructing 
and rigorous feedbacks, as well as to establish contacts with members of 
the french machine learning community. PhD Students are particularly 
welcome and encouraged to submit papers. Contributions will be freely 
distributed on the conference website, subject to approval by the authors.

*KEY DATES*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Joint Event: *5-8 July 2022*
     - Cap papers submission deadline: *8th of April 2022 *
     - Notification to authors for CAp papers: *17th of May 2022*
     - Early bird registration for the conference: *29th May 2022**
*

*TOPICS*

------------------------------------------------------------------------
