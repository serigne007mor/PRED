DISTRIBUTED AND PARALLEL DATABASES JOURNAL

A SPECIAL ISSUE ON:

NEW TRENDS IN PHYSICAL DATA WAREHOUSE DESIGN


Guest Editor
Ladjel Bellatreche LISI/ENSMA  Poitiers University FRANCE
===================================================================

AIMS AND SCOPE
--------------

Since fifteen years ago, data warehousing and On-Line analysis (OLAP) technologies proved 
their effectiveness in managing and analyzing huge amounts of structured and semi structured 
data. The rapidly growing size of data warehouses and high complexity of OLAP queries due 
to the presence of joins, selections and aggregations have been at the origin of significant 
research and technological challenges. To guarantee a better performance for these complex 
queries, the physical design process of data warehouses becomes a very crucial issue.  
Intensive studies were conducted in this topic that concerns two main directions: (i) 
optimization techniques: materialized views, advanced indexing schemes, horizontal and 
vertical partitioning, data parallel processing, clustering, etc. and (ii) methods for selecting 
these techniques. 

The aim of this special issue of the Distributed and Parallel Databases is twofold.  First is to 
present new and challenging issues in the field of physical data warehouse design (in 
centralized, distributed and parallel environments). Secondly is to present the current research 
and technological development in this field.
