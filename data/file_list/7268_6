The WeCA (Web Computing and Application) track will focus on emerging and n=
ovel concepts,
architectures and methodologies for information management=2E The Internet =
and the related
technologies have created an interconnected world in which information can =
be exchanged easily,
tasks can be processed collaboratively, communities of users with similarly=
 interests
can be formed to achieve efficiency and improve performance=2E

Taking full advantage of these interconnected environments to meet the ever=
 increasing
needs of emerging application requires solutions that address new issues an=
d challenges=2E
Novel architectures are being proposed to allow resource sharing and distri=
buted processing
of linked data and devices=2E Peer to peer computing, mobile information sy=
stems, semantic
based applications, linked data systems, Internet of things etc=2E are a fe=
w examples=2E

Topics of interest include, but not limited, to:
----------------------------------------------

* Data semantics
* Web-Centric Systems
* Semantic Web
* Social media and networking
* Big Data
* Information System Interoperability
* Digital Libraries
* Cloud Computing
* Integrated, Virtualized and Distributed Information Systems
* Multimedia and application
* Information security
* Service Based Systems


Submission and publication
--------------------------
SITIS'15 WeCa Track invites submission of high quality and original papers
on the topics listed above=2E
Allsubmitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for
technical merit, originality, significance and relevance to track topics=
=2E

Papers must be up to 8 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication for=
mat=2E

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and publishe=
d
by IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major indexes=
=2E

Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for potential publicat=
ion
journals=2E



Important dates
---------------
* Paper Submission (extended): September 21, 2015
* Acceptance/Reject notification: October 15, 2015
* Camera ready: October 22, 2015
* Author registration: October 22, 2015
