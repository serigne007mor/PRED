Call for papers for the 1st International Workshop on "Advances in Conceptu=
al
Knowledge Engineering"
in conjunction with DEXA 2007



http://www.dexa.org



Regensburg, Germany

3-7 September 2007


Organised by: Sadok Ben Yahia (Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, Tunisia), Jean=
 Diatta (IREMIA, La R=E9union Island, France) and Engelbert Mephu Nguifo (C=
RIL, France)



Knowledge engineering (KE) consists in building, maintaining and developing=
 knowledge-based systems. It has a great deal in common with software engin=
eering,=20

and is related to many computer science domains such as artificial intellig=
ence, databases, data mining, expert systems, decision support systems, use=
r=20

modelling, web technologies, computational linguistics and geographic infor=
mation systems.=20


Knowledge engineering is also related to mathematical logic, as well as str=
ongly involved in cognitive science and socio-cogintive engineering where t=
he=20

knowledge is produced by socio-cognitive aggregates (mainly humans) and is =
structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic =
works.=20

Various activities of KE specific for the development of a knowledge-based =
system: Assessment of the problem; Development of a knowledge-based system=
=20

shell/structure; Implementation of the structured knowledge into knowledge-=
bases; Acquisition and structuring of the related information, knowledge an=
d=20

specific preferences; Testing and validation of the inserted knowledge; Int=
egration and maintenance of the system; Revision and evaluation of the syst=
em.=20

Being still more art than engineering, KE is not as neat as the above list =
in practice. The phases overlap, the process might be iterative, and many=
=20

challenges could appear. Recently, emerges meta-knowledge engineering as a =
new formal systemic approach to the development of an unified knowledge and=
=20

intelligence theory.

Conceptual knowledge engineering aims to put more emphasis on the interrela=
tionships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable th=
em to=20

function togetherduring the KE process. One major goal here is to focus the=
 KE process onto the design of conceptual models, methods and structures. O=
ur=20

objective in this workshop is to provide information on recent advances on =
KE using conceptual similarity-based measures, concept lattices, conceptual=
=20

graphs, rough sets, description logics, concept mapping, ontologies and mor=
e, in both theoretical and applicational aspects of KE.


The ultimate aim of this workshop is to provide state-of-the-art informatio=
n to academics, researchers, and industry practitioners whom are involved o=
r=20

interested in both theoretical and applicational aspects of conceptual know=
ledge engineering. Prospective authors are invited to submit original and=
=20

previously unpublished research showing related to the following topics:=20

* Conceptual structures,=20
*Relationship of FCA with other methods of data analysis (clustering, assoc=
iation rules, classification, etc.),=20
*Data for Formal Concept Analysis (object-attribute data, pre-processing of=
 data, conceptual scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.),=20
* Applications FCA on semantic web and ontologies,=20

Instructions for authors and Important dates


Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research and application
papers that are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will
be limited to 5 two-column pages (IEEE Proceeding style) including figures
and references. Please comply with the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedi=
ngs
Author Guidelines to prepare your papers. Electronic submission
of manuscripts (in postscript, word or pdf format) is required and will be
handled via the workshop Web site (to be announced soon). For any further
inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact the workshop organizers.
In addition, at least one author of each accepted paper is required to atte=
nd
the conference and present the paper. Papers accepted for presentation
will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press as proceedings of the
DEXA 2007 workshops.


**Important dates:

Deadline for authors to submit papers: March 1st, 2007
