     *Call for Papers. EXPPORT Workshop* at ICCBR 2013
     EXperience reuse: Provenance, Process-ORientation and Traces

     July 9th 2013, Saratoga Springs, USA


     _Workshop Description_

*EXPPORT: EXperience reuse: Provenance, Process-ORientation and Traces*, is=
a workshop aiming to provide
a medium of exchange for information in CBR for Processes, Traces, and Work=
flows research.
Provenance, process-oriented CBR, and traces are all strong areas of curren=
t interest in the CBR community,
and have close relationships. Process-oriented CBR focuses largely on workf=
lows, which define sequences
of actions for use and reuse. Provenance captures the results of such seque=
nces, providing a resource for
capturing workflow cases and for analyzing how action sequences may be refi=
ned. Traces capture the results
of action sequences generated "on the fly," for example, as performed by th=
e user of a computer system,
and traces research must contend with how to generate useful cases from exe=
cution information.

Consequently, several types of contributions are of interest of this worksh=
op, related to a spectrum
of areas such as *Business Process Management, Software Process reuse, repr=
oducibility,
learning by observation/demonstration, trace-based reasoning, opponent mode=
ling in games*.

Business Process Management (BPM) is a set of activities aimed at defining,=
executing, monitoring and
optimizing BP, with the objective of making the business of an enterprise a=
s effective and efficient
as possible, and of increasing its economic success. Such activities are hi=
ghly automated, typically
by means of the workflow technology. BPM activities, and BP optimization in=
particular,
may ask the enterprise to be able to flexibly change and adapt the predefin=
ed process schema,
in response to expected situations (e.g. new laws, reengineering efforts) a=
s well as to unanticipated
exceptions and problems in the operating environment (e.g. emergencies). Ag=
ile workflow technology
is the technical solution to deal with such adaptation and overriding needs=
. In order to provide
an effective and quick workflow change support, many agile workflow systems=
share the idea
of recalling and reusing concrete examples of changes adopted in the past.
  To this end, Case-based Reasoning (CBR) has been proposed as a natural me=
thodological solution.

Software Processes can be studied from different points of view. In the Sof=
tware Engineering field,
artifacts like models, diagrams, etc. define Software Development Processes=
that can be reused to generate
new applications. There is also a significant trend on reusing different so=
ftware components to compose
a workflow that models the behavior of a system. Web Services, Scientific S=
oftware or Product Lines are
some examples of such approaches, and we cannot forget the closely related =
task of Planning.
All these areas are related to Software Processes and can take advantage of=
the CBR paradigm to reuse
existing solutions, components, compositions or plans.

In many complex domains such as automobile driving, for example, there is n=
o explicit model of any process,
or process models are not well known. Moreover, processes as well as knowle=
dge evolve over time and their
dynamic nature must be taken into account. This has given rise to significa=
nt interest in artificial
intelligence approaches based on traces.

An important part of users' experience can be stored in traces that record =
human activity supported by
computer systems. Such traces can record user interactions with a computer =
system through an application,
a game, etc. Traces take the form of sequences of temporally situated actio=
ns and may be collected either
from log files, text files or from sensors in applications programs. The op=
portunity to collect user experience
as traces enables reusing them by CBR. Thus they constitute a knowledge con=
tainer from which a CBR process may
build and reuse cases. Traces may also be used to discover or refine an und=
erlying process model, or to study
how actual usage fits a recommended process model, good practices, etc. The=
exploitation of these containers
for various purposes presents opportunities for many facets of AI: reuse tr=
aces, dynamic users assistance,
activity analysis, workflow mining and more generally cases and knowledge a=
cquisition.


     _Aims and Scope_

The aim of the EXPPORT workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of=
trends, research issues and
practical experiences in all the areas illustrated above, to understand the=
commonalities and differences,
and advance the state of the art in all of them, ideally, to forge shared g=
oals and benefit from shared
experiences. *Research contributions submitted to the workshop will be rela=
ted to areas that include,
but are not limited to, the following:*

   * Methodological issues:
       o Case-based representation of process knowledge (by workflows,
         traces, plans, etc.)
       o Case-based retrieval for process reuse and optimization
       o Similarity measures for process reuse and optimization
       o Case-based adaptation for process optimization
       o Extraction of process knowledge, workflow mining
       o Interplay of provenance, trust, and confidence
       o Acquisition and management of provenance and meta-data
       o Use of provenance and meta-data in knowledge discovery, data
         mining, and text mining for case acquisition
       o Use of provenance to support case-based reasoning
       o Provenance representation
       o Visualization and explanation of process knowledge
       o Toolkits / methodologies for managing and reusing traces
       o Architectures of trace reusing systems
       o Trace models, trace elements and cases
       o Collecting traces, building/mining cases from traces
       o Provenance information regarding traces
       o Learning / adaptation of traces
       o Reasoning via user demonstrations/observations
       o Planning from user traces
   * Applications, systems and tools:
       o CBR applications in Business Process Management, Software
         Processes, E-Science, Web Science, E-Governance, E-Health,
         product development, search, games, cooking, and further
         application domains
       o Evaluating CBR tools for PO-CBR
       o Agile workflow technology with CBR components
       o CBR in (commercial) workflow management tools
       o Novel applications of trace-based reasoning
       o Integration of trace-based techniques and gaming environments
       o Game playing via user traces
   * Lessons learned in PO-CBR investigations and trace-based reasoning
   * Challenge tasks for CBR systems in the context of business
     processes, software processes, planning processes, search processes

Depending on the submissions received, we anticipate pursuing a journal spe=
cial issue based
on extended versions of the best papers from the workshop.
