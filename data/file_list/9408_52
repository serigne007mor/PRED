CLEF 2015: Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum

Experimental IR meets Multilinguality, Multimodality and Interaction

September 8-11, 2015, Toulouse, France

http://clef2015.clef-initiative.eu/ <http://clef2015.clef-initiative.eu/>

Submission Deadlines:

- Sunday April 12, 2015 (long papers)
- Sunday May 17 (short papers)


CALL FOR PAPERS

The CLEF Conference addresses all aspects of Information Access in any
modality and language. The conference is teamed up with a series of
workshops presenting the results of lab-based comparative evaluation.
CLEF 2015 is the 6th year of the CLEF Conference and the 16th year of
the CLEF initiative as a forum for IR Evaluation.  The CLEF conference
has a clear focus on experimental IR as done at the evaluation forums
(CLEF Labs, TREC, NTCIR, FIRE, MediaEval, RomIP, SemEval, TAC, =E2=80=A6) w=
ith
special attention to the challenges of multimodality, multilinguality,
and interactive search.  We invite submissions on significant new
insights demonstrated on the resulting IR test collections, on analysis
of IR test collections and evaluation measures, as well as on concrete
proposals to push the boundaries of the Cranfield/TREC/CLEF paradigm.

All submissions to the CLEF main conference will be reviewed on the
basis of relevance, originality, importance, and clarity. CLEF welcomes
papers that describe rigorous hypothesis testing regardless of whether
the results are positive or negative. Methods are expected to be written
so that they are reproducible by others, and the logic of the research
design is clearly described in the paper. The conference proceedings
will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

TOPICS

Relevant topics for the CLEF 2015 Conference include but are not limited to:

- Information Access in any language or modality: Information retrieval,
image retrieval, question answering, search interfaces and design,
infrastructures, etc.

- Analytics for Information Retrieval: theoretical and practical results
in the analytics field that are specifically targeted for information
access data analysis.

- Evaluation Initiatives: Conclusions, lessons learned, impact and
projection of any evaluation initiative after completing their cycle.

- Evaluation: methodologies, metrics, statistical and analytical tools,
component based, user groups and use cases, ground-truth creation,
impact of multilingual/multicultural/multimodal differences, etc.

- Technology Transfer: Economic impact/sustainability of information
access approaches, deployment and exploitation of systems, use cases, etc.

- Interactive Information Retrieval Evaluation: the interactive
evaluation of IR systems using user-centered methods, evaluation of
novel search interfaces, novel interactive evaluation methods,
simulation of interaction, etc.

- Specific Application Domains: Information access and its evaluation in
application domains such as cultural heritage, digital libraries, social
media, expert search, health information, legal documents, patents,
news, books, plants, etc.

FORMAT

Authors are invited to submit electronically original papers, which have
not been published and are not under consideration elsewhere, using the
LNCS proceedings format:

http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-7-72376-0 <http://www.s=
