             (there will be no further extension)


The 12th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in=20=20
Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that=20=20
brings together researchers working on metaheuristics that are used to=20=20
solve difficult combinatorial optimization problems appearing in=20=20
various industrial, economic, and scientific domains. Prominent=20=20
examples of metaheuristics include: evolutionary algorithms, simulated=20=20
annealing, tabu search, scatter search and path relinking, memetic=20=20
algorithms, ant colony and particle swarm optimization, variable=20=20
neighbourhood search, iterated local search, greedy randomized=20=20
adaptive search procedures, estimation of distribution algorithms, and=20=20
hyperheuristics. Successfully solved problems include scheduling,=20=20
timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution problems,=20=20
vehicle routing, travelling salesman, graph problems, satisfiability,=20=20
packing problems, planning problems, and general mixed integer=20=20
programming.

The EvoCOP 2012 conference will be held in the city of M=C3=A0laga located=
=20=20
in the spanish province Andalusia. The conference will be held in=20=20
conjunction with EuroGP (the 15th European Conference on Genetic=20=20
Programming), EvoBio (the 10th European Conference on Evolutionary=20=20
Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Computational=20=20
Biology), EvoMUSART (10th european conference on evolutionary and=20=20
biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and=20=20
EvoApplications (specialist events on a range of evolutionary=20=20
computation topics and applications), in a joint event collectively=20=20
known as EVO*.
