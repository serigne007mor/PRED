Context

A major trend of work in complex network modeling and mining concerns 
analyzing homogeneous static networks (i.e. one snapshot of a network). 
However, in real world settings, networks are often dynamic, 
heterogeneous, and both nodes and links can be described by a set of 
attributes. The concept of multiplex network has been recently proposed 
to ease modeling real work networks. A multiplex network is often 
represented as a multi-layer network composed of  a set of nodes related 
to each other with different types of relations. On the other hand, the 
concept of attributed network has also been introduced recently to take 
into account the fact that the vertices of the network are described by 
attributes like for instance their genre or age. These representations 
are much richer than simple complex networks often used to model complex 
interaction systems. However, this poses the challenge to provide 
adequate answers to all basic network analysis tasks that have been 
studied and provided in the recent few years for the case of homogeneous 
networks without attributes. This include for instance: the problem of 
node ranking (computing nodes centralities), community detection, link 
prediction, information diffusion models and network visualization. 
Almost all work in the field of multiplex network analysis are based on 
transforming the problem, in a way or another to the classical case of 
homogeneous network analysis. Existing approaches for multiplex networks 
analysis include: layer aggregation based approaches or applying 
ensemble methods on results obtained on each layer aside. Little work 
has focused on analyzing all layers at once.  First propositions have 
also been done to adapt community detection algorithms for attributed 
networks but there is a need for an in-depth analysis. The goal of this 
workshop is make the point on new approaches for multiplex and 
attributed network mining.

In the context of this workshop, we  encourage contributions on methods 
and techniques that are transversal to every application domains, rather 
than focusing on specific issues concerning each domain separately. We 
will consider the two main aspects of network analysis: modeling and 
knowledge discovery.
