Veuillez trouver ci-dessous l'annonce préliminaire des organisateurs pour le
prochain OWL Experiences and Directions Workshop.

*********************************************************
Preliminary Announcement and Preliminary Call for Participation
         OWL Experiences and Directions Workshop
    Washington, D.C., U.S.A., 1-2 April 2008 (dates tentative)

(This is a preliminary announcement, providing information primarily for
those interested in submitting a paper to the workshop.  More details
on the workshop will be available shortly.)

The fourth OWL: Experiences and Directions workshop will again bring
users, implementors and researchers together in order to measure the
current state of need against the state of the art and to set an agenda
for language evolutions that satisfy users.  This OWLED workshop will
last two days and will be held in the Washington, D.C., area, in the
first week of April 2008.  The workshop will concentrate on issues
related to the development and W3C standardization of OWL 1.1, but other
issues related to OWL are also of interest, particularly those related
to the task forces set up at OWLED 2007.

As an "interim" workshop, the workshop will be more open and
unconstrained than recent OWLED workshops.  The workshop will have two
very different kinds of activities.  There will be some formal
presentation of some submissions to the workshop.  However, the bulk of
the workshop will be devoted to self-organizing groups discussing topics
related to submissions to the workshop and possibly other topics related
to OWL.

Making this self-organization work will require effort on the part of
the attendees.  Workshop attendees should read submissions accepted at
the workshop before the workshop starts so that they can contribute to
the discussions at the workshop.  Attendees should also prepare single
"slides" that can be presented during these discussions.

Potential attendees who need official invitations to the workshop should
submit a short statement of interest (maximum 4 pages, LNCS style, but
shorter is better).  To allow attendees to make travel plans,
submissions of interest submitted early will receive early invitations.
There will also be open registration for the workshop.

Longer papers (up to 10 pages, LNCS style) can also be submitted to the
workshop and space will be reserved for authors of papers.  Accepted
papers will be made available to attendees before the workshop.

Preliminary Deadlines and Schedule:

14 January 2008  Statements of interest for early invitation due
1 February 2008  Early invitations sent out
1 February 2008  Statements of interest for regular invitation due
1 February 2008  Intents to submit formal paper due
15 February 2008  Papers due
15 Feburary 2008  Regular invitations sent out
1 March 2008   Paper acceptances sent out
15 March 2008   Final versions of papers due
1-2 April 2008   OWLED workshop (tentative)

Submission details to follow.
