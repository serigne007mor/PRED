VIEW 2007 is the second edition of a successful workshop that brought toget=
her researchers from=20
all around the world working on pixelization methods.
These methods associate an information entity with a single pixel so that a=
 set of information=20
entities can be translated to an image.
=20
GOALS
The first Visual Information Expert Workshop defined the basis of the pixel=
ization paradigm.
This year, the workshop is aiming at consolidating this basis and at explor=
ing the ways open by the=20
first workshop.Moreover, in order to make pixelization methods known to non=
 pixelization specialists,
the workshop is also open to all  other 2D information visualization method=
s.
=20
TOPICS
The workshop encourages submissions on all topics related to pixelization a=
nd=20
non-pixelization 2D visualization methods, including (but not limited to) t=
he following:
* Mathematics, Discrete Geometry and Statistics
* Information sciences: Computer sciences, Data mining, Web sciences, Netwo=

* Physics
* Medicine and biology (genomic, proteomic...)
* Economics, Management
* Psychology, Neuro-Cognitive sciences, Sociology
* Engineering
* Geography, Demography
