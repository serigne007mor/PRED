Subject: [liste-egc] Reminder - AGILE GIR Tutorial: Call for participation
 and for presentations

Apologies for cross postings

Dear Colleagues,

Please find attached a call for participation and presentations at a
tutorial on Geographic Information Retrieval, to be hosted at AGILE in
Avignon this spring. Please feel free to forward the call to potentially
interested attendees, especially junior researchers active in the area. Note
especially the deadline for short paper submissions on March 23rd.=20

Best wishes,

Ross Purves, B=E9n=E9dicte Bucher and Mauro Gaio


"AGILE GIR Tutorial: Call for participation and for presentations"=20

We are pleased to announce the Geographic Information Retrieval Tutorial to
be held at the AGILE conference, April 24th in Avignon (France). The
registration is now open on the AGILE 2012 conference web site :

http://agile2012.imag.fr/index.php/registration.

Geographic Information Retrieval addresses the management of geographic
information locked in unstructured textual documents (current and historic
newspapers, social media and, increasingly, official documents). The growing
amount of unstructured data will increase with open data initiatives, making
this field even more important to our society.

Furthermore, the wider availability of structured and partially structured
data (INSPIRE, Semantic Web, etc.) suggests a further set of opportunities
and challenges for GIR since these data are useful for the GIR process.

The tutorial will be an opportunity for junior and senior academics
interested in the field of Geographic Information Retrieval to participate
in tutorials addressing key themes in the field, hear talks addressing the
state of the art, present their own work and participate in a discussion on
upcoming challenges in the field.

The proposed three main sessions will focus on theoretical background to and
practical worked examples on:

* Toponym grounding and footprint definition, facilitated by Jochen Leidner
(Thomson-Reuters)
* Spatial and temporal indices and their influence on document ranking,
facilitated by Chris Jones (Cardiff University)
* Evaluation strategies in GIR and their strengths and weaknesses,
facilitated by Ross Purves (University of Zurich)


We also invite participants to submit 2 page abstracts describing work in
progress relevant to one of the three sessions. Abstracts should describe
the work and problems encountered therein; we are particularly interested in
a discussion of challenges, and thus discourage submission of finished work.
Abstracts will be distributed to workshop participants at the workshop, with
time for a short presentation of the work and discussion of key challenges
for GIR. Please use ACM styles in preparing your abstract
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates).

Note however that the key aim of the tutorial is to discuss basic concepts,
and abstract submission is neither required nor expected from participants.
Besides, participants are encouraged to bring their laptop to take part to
some hands on exercises during the tutorial.


Important dates:

- March 23rd: deadline for short paper submission
- April 2nd: notification of acceptance
- April 24th: tutorial


Organising committee: Ross Purves, Mauro Gaio, B=E9n=E9dicte Bucher, Jochen
Leidner, Chris Jones, Damien Palacio.
