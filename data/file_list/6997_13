Subject: [liste-egc] 6-month internship position in data mining

Internship Position

Title: “Robust evolutionary clustering for analyzing the social media”
Supervision: Julien VELCIN, Julien JACQUES and Stéphane BONNEVAY
Place: ERIC Lab (http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/)
Internship salary: 508 euros / month
Duration: 6 months

Context
The ImagiWeb project, funded by the French National Research Agency, 
aims at studying the image (or web reputation) of entities of various 
kinds, such as companies and politicians. To this end, we apply advanced 
data mining techniques for analyzing the textual data posted on Twitter 
or blogs. The study of those representations and their dynamics is 
considered today to be a real challenge which deals with several issues 
of data mining: information/topic extraction, opinion mining, web 
reputation, social network analysis etc. The project involves six 
partners (3 academic labs, 3 companies) and we consider two real case 
studies.

Description
Evolutionary clustering aims at capturing the temporal evolution of 
clusters. This issue is particularly important in the context of social 
media data that are naturally temporally driven. We’ve recently proposed 
a new probabilistic model-based evolutionary clustering technique: the 
Temporal Multinomial Mixture (TMM) [2]. TMM is an extension of classical 
mixture model that optimizes feature co-occurrences in the trade-off 
with temporal smoothness. In order to link the distributions at two 
consecutive time points, we extend the idea developed in [1] for the 
case of multinomial data. These two competitive approaches give good 
results but they need to be improved, especially regarding the stability 
of the resulting clusters (e.g., [5]) and selecting the number of 
components automatically (e.g., [6]). The student will first explore the 
literature of robust clustering methods [3,4]. S/he will then propose 
solutions in order to improve the methods developed in the project so 
far. He will perform extensive experiments on two real datasets provided 
by the ImagiWeb project. The first dataset has been extracted from 
Twitter and it deals with the image of two French politicians during the 
last presidential elections. The second dataset comes from blog posts 
and it deals with the image of a company over the Web.

Profile requirements
Priority will be given to students who are familiar with the techniques 
of statistical machine learning (mainly clustering), probabilistic 
models, graphical models.

Application procedure
Applications must be sent by email to Julien Velcin 
(julien.velcin@univ-lyon2.fr), Julien Jacques 
(julien.jacques@univ-lyon2.fr) and Stéphane Bonnevay 
(stephane.bonnevay@univ-lyon1.fr). Candidates should send the following 
elements: a cover letter, a CV, marks and awards obtained during their 
Master degree, recommendations (optional).
After a first selection step, interviews will be organized before taking 
the final decision.
