Subject: [liste-egc] BigCVEn 2015: 1st CFP: 2nd International IEEE Workshop
 on "BIG DATA meets CLOUD and VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENT"

BigCVEn 2015

2nd International IEEE Workshop on "BIG DATA meets CLOUD and VIRTUALIZED 
ENVIRONMENT"

Collocated with:

SITIS 2015 - The 11th International Conference on SIGNAL IMAGE 
TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS
November 23-27, 2014 - Bangkok, Thailand

Scope of the Workshop
There is a growing interest in virtualized environments and their 
applications, raising several challenges.
Many trends are emerging to address these issues. In this respect, Cloud 
computing provides a powerful model to connect users to information 
resources from anywhere in the world.
It has become a significant technology with several advantages including 
cost savings, access to greater computing resources, high availability, 
and scalability.
In addition, the advent of Semantic Web has raised new opportunities and 
challenges.
In this context, Big Data and Linked Data are being an integral part of 
the web infrastructure, where massive amounts of connected or possibly 
interconnectable data, adressable via URIs/IRIs, are available. These 
technologies are paving the way of the Web of Data.
The aim of the BigCVEn Workshop is to provide a forum to bring together 
scientists, researchers and practitioners interested in these emerging 
architectures and
methodologies for capturing, storing, managing and analyzing massive, 
dispersed, interconnected data over the Web. It also aims to discuss the 
connection and\or interaction
between Web of Data/Linked Data and Big Data/Cloud Computing.

Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

• Cloud computing/mobility and cloud
Cloud Computing standards and technologies
Cloud Computing specifications and enhancements
Cloud Computing discovery and integration
Cloud Computing, cluster and high performance computing and storage 
infrastructure for massive data
Cloud Computing security and QoS
Cloud Computing applications and solutions

Mobile data analytics
• Web of data, Linked data/object
Publishing Linked Data and Data Interlinking
Large Scale Ontologies Matching and Mapping
Instances Matching and Semantic Interoperability
Linked Open Services
Linked Open Data Cloud
Linked Data Science
Government Linked Data
• Web Services, Virtualized systems and Applications

Important dates
Submission deadline: September 6, 2015
Acceptance/Reject notification: October 5, 2015
Camera-ready: October 15, 2015
Author Registration: October 15, 2015

Submission
The BigCVEn Workshop is part of the SITIS 2015 conference,  which will 
include keynote addresses, tutorials, and regular and workshop sessions. 
We invite submission of high quality and original papers on the topics 
listed above.
Each submission should be at most 8 pages in total including 
bibliography and well-marked appendices, and must follow the IEEE double 
columns publication format available at:
·         Microsoft Word DOC
·         LaTex Formatting Macros

Paper submission will only be online via: Easy Chair.
Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these 
guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
All submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, 
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of expression by at least 
two reviewers. The organizers will examine the reviews and make final 
paper selections.

Publication
All the papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the 
conference proceedings. The proceedings will be published by IEEE 
Computer Society. Content will be submitted to the indexing companies 
for possible indexing. They will be available at the conference.

Registration
At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the 
workshop. Workshop registration fee is determined by SITIS. A single 
registration for the workshop or the conference allows attending both 
events.
