AIMS AND TOPICS

Environmental and geo-spatial data is currently obtained by =
crowdsourcing and public administrations in the context of open data =
policies. Mining EnGeo data can provide significant insights and =
potentials to several domains such as public health, medicine, =
agriculture, among others. In public health, EnGeo data analysis can =
help detect, control, and monitor diseases caused by social phenomena =
(e.g., urbanization, globalization, trade, etc.), and by environmental =
factors (e.g., outdoor/indoor air pollution, water, sanitation, etc.).=20=

In the context on changing environment, "One Health" approaches focus on =
interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared =
environment. In this domain, ingestion and mining environmental and =
geo-spatial data is crucial for early detection, warning and assessment =
of threats for (re-)emergence of infectious diseases.
In agriculture, the use of digital tools, methods, and technologies =
increases the amount of produced data, which can also be leveraged to =
identify variations in the field (e.g. crops, soil conditions, water =
quality), and to deal with them using alternative strategies.=20
The analysis of EnGeo data is thus associated with two major challenges: =
1) the integration of heterogenous data and formats due to the high =
variability of data types such as structured, semantic, spatial and =
temporal; and 2) the selection of the appropriate knowledge discovery =
process according to different fields. The main objective of this =
special session is to provide high quality research facing both =
challenges previously mentioned with theoretical or experimental =
approaches.

Topics:
- Pre and post processing of environmental data
- Geographical information retrieval
- Spatial data mining, data warehousing, and spatial data lake
- Knowledge discovery use-cases applied to environmental data
- Spatial text mining
- Spatial ontology
- Spatial recommendation and personalization
- Visual analytics for geospatial data
- Dedicated applications:
	* Spatio-temporal analytics platform
	* Agricultural decision support systems
	* Urban traffic systems
	* Trajectory analysis
	* Land-use and urban policies
	* Land-use and urban planning analysis
	* Spatio-temporal analysis in ecology and agriculture
	* Disease surveillance systems (One Health)
