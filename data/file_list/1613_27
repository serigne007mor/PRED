Venue: 
******************************** 
VILNIUS, the capital of the Republic of Lithuania, becomes one of the 
most beautiful cities in Central and Eastern Europe. The most precious 
historical and cultural heritage is concentrated in the capital. The 
buildings of the old town around 1,5 thousand are from different ages 
and all European styles of architecture. The main accents symbolizing 
the capital are Gediminas tower and Cathedral square. In 1994 the old 
city of Vilnius was included into the list of the UNESCO World cultural 
heritage. In 2009 Vilnius is announced as capital of culture of Europe, 
and, thus, hundreds of festivals and next events are waiting you.
