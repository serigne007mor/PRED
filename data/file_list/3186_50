*26th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems**
**
**May 20th-22nd 2020**
**Graz University of Technology*

*https://ismis.ist.tugraz.at/call-for-papers-2/*

*Call for Papers*

ISMIS is an established Artificial Intelligence conference for 
exchanging the latest research results in building intelligent systems. 
It provides a basis for exchanging research results and transport 
scientific achievements towards industrial applications. The scope of 
ISMIS is to present a wide range of topics related to the application of 
Artificial Intelligence techniques related to areas such as decision 
support, knowledge representation, logical programming, knowledge-based 
systems, machine learning, planning, computer vision, information 
retrieval, configuration and diagnosis. The conference also focus on 
interdisciplinary research in AI-related fields, for example, decision 
support systems and human decision making or recommender systems and 
human personality, and knowledge-based systems development and cognitive 
aspects of knowledge understanding.

*Conference Theme*

Motivated by recent developments in sub-symbolic AI and the continuous 
emergence of new application domains, this year’s conference theme 
(represented by a special track) is “Towards explainable Artificial 
Intelligence”. With this, ISMI2020 contributes to emerging challenges 
related to the explainability of system outputs which experience an 
increased relevance in areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent 
sales assistants, and different further application domains such as 
medicine, intelligent maintenance, and eLearning.

*Topics of Interest*

ISMIS 2020 is intended to attract individuals who are actively engaged 
both in theoretical and practical aspects of intelligent systems. The 
goal is to provide a platform for a useful exchange between 
theoreticians and practitioners, and to foster the cross-fertilization 
of ideas: Relevant conference topics include but are not limited to:

  * Explainable AI (XAI)
  * Machine Learning
  * Deep learning
  * Data Mining
  * Recommender Systems
  * Constraint based systems
  * Autonomous systems
  * Applications (Configuration, Internet of Things, Financial Services,
    e-Health…)
  * Intelligent user interfaces
  * User Modeling
  * Human computation
  * Socially-aware systems
  * Autonomous systems
  * Digital libraries
  * Intelligent Agents
  * Information Retrieval
  * Natural Language Processing
  * Knowledge Integration
  * Knowledge Visualization
  * Knowledge Representation
  * Soft Computing
  * Web & Text Mining


*Publication*

The ISMIS 2020 proceedings will be published by Springer in LNAI 
(Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) and will be available at the 
conference. Authors of best papers will be invited to submit their 
extended versions to the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems 
(JIIS) published by Springer. Fast Track Processing will be used to have 
them reviewed and published.

*Submission*

Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts in LNCS/LNAI style 
(maximum 10 pages). All paper submissions will be handled 
electronically. All submissions will be subject to review by the ISMIS 
2020 Program Committee. Papers should be submitted in PDF form via the 
ISMIS 2020 Online Submission System (EasyChair- submit here).

Paper submission deadline (via EasyChair): Jan. 10th, 2020.

*Conference Committee*

General Chair: Alexander Felfernig (Graz University of Technology)
Program Chairs: Denis Helic (Graz University of Technology), Gerhard 
Leitner (AAU Klagenfurt), Martin Stettinger (Graz University of Technology)
Steering Committee Chair: Zbigniew Ras (University of North Carolina)
Publicity Chair: Müslüm Atas (Graz University of Technology)
Publication Chair: Trang Tran (Graz University of Technology)
