QIMIE'09: The First Workshop Quality issues, measures of interestingness 
and evaluation of data mining models

**************************************************
Submission deadline extended to January, 6th, 2009
**************************************************

Bangkok, Thailand
April 27, 2009.

http://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/qimie2009/

QIMIE'09 held in conjunction with with the next PAKDD'09 conference 
(http://www.pakdd2009.org/, Bangkok, Thailand,on April 27-30, 2009), a 
major international conference in the areas of data mining and knowledge 
discovery.
=============================================================================== 


===============
CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

The Quality issues, measures of interestingness and evaluation of data 
mining models Workshop (QIMIE'09) will focus on the theory, the 
techniques and the practices that can ensure the discovered knowledge is 
of quality.

We invite submissions on all aspects of quality and evaluation of data 
mining models.

The submitted papers must not be published or under consideration to be 
published elsewhere. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members 
of the Program Committee.

Each paper should consist of a cover page with title, authors’ names, 
postal and email address, an up to 200-words abstract, up to 5 keywords 
and a body not longer than 12 single-spaced pages with font size at 
least 11 pts.

Authors are strongly encouraged to use Springer’s manuscript submission 
guidelines (available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).

Outstanding papers presented at QMIE'09 could be considered for 
publication in a LNCS/LNAI Post Proceedings of PAKDD Workshops published 
by Springer (planned by the end of November 2009) or in a post-workshop 
journal special issues. Information about these possibilities will be 
provided as soon as possible.

===================================================
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
===================================================

* objective measures of interest (for individual rules, for rules basis)
* subjective measures of interest and quality based on human knowledge,
quality of ontologies, etc. (for individual rules, for rules basis)
* algorithmic properties of measures
* comparison of algorithm: issues with benchmarks, methodologies,
statistical tests, etc.
* robustness evaluation
* special issues: imbalanced data, very large data, very high
dimensional data
* special issues in specialized domains: bioinformatics, security, etc.
* graphical tools like ROC, cost curves
* etc.
