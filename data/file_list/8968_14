CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on the Semantic Analysis of Documents (SemADoc 2014)
-------------------------------------------------------------

https://sites.google.com/site/semadoc2014/

Hosted by the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering
September 16-19,  Fort Collins, near Denver, Colorado, USA

Scope and topics:

A large number of document management problems would benefit from
having the semantics of documents explicitly represented. However,
manually assigning semantic descriptions to documents is labour
intensive and error prone. At the same time, the manual generation
of domain specific taxonomies is not only labour intensive, but it
also needs to be repeated often as the domains themselves and
their key concepts shift with time.

In this workshop we will focus on document content analysis and
semantic enrichment to generate a layer of semantic description of
documents that is useful for document management tasks, such as
semantic information retrieval, conceptual organization and
clustering of document collections for sense making, semantic
expert profiling, and document recommender systems.

The workshop is timely and relevant to the Document Engineering
community, as its focus is on semantically enriching documents and
document collections, to make them more accessible to their
readers. The task is nontrivial due to the volume of text data and
the rate at which text data is accumulated by companies,
government, and individuals.

We invite submissions in all areas of semantic analysis and
enrichment of documents, such as:
- automatic tagging of documents
- named entity disambiguation
- semantic linking of documents
- interactive classification and clustering of documents
- document summarization
- curation and validation of the analysis process, generation of visualizations of documents
- author and document collection semantics
- user engagement in the semantic analysis process via suitable annotation and correction tools
- study of the trade off between accuracy of the results and user effort

Submissions aimed at solving practical problems in specific
application domains are especially welcome, including but not
limited to:
- digital libraries
- legal document management
- personalized online learning systems
- news media

We encourage submissions of work in progress, concept papers, and
generally material that will stimulate discussion, generate useful
feedback to the authors, promote research collaborations and
vigorous exchange of ideas on promising research directions.
