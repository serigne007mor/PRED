Title: Mining Object Movement Patterns from Trajectory Data
Abstract: Mining object movement patterns to understand the behavior of mov=
ing objects has
many high impact applications. However even if existing pattern models are =
meaningful,
there are still challenging issues such as: 1) there are many kinds of patt=
erns and algorithms
without an efficient management scheme, 2) lacking of relevant approaches i=
n dealingwith
time gaps, 3) they usually focus on an unchanged group of objects and thus =
do not capture
the behavior of the whole object class, 4) Naturally, there are huge amount=
 of very redundant
movement patterns extracted while only a few of them are meaningful. Howeve=
r, few
researchers address this issue. 5) Despite the growing demands for diverse =
applications,
there have been few scalable tools for mining massive and sophisticated mov=
ing object
data.
In my thesis, I will mainly focus on addressing these issues. We propose th=
e three step
framework: 1) the first step aims to present and framework to mine and mana=
ge different
existing movement patterns in an efficient way, 2) in the second step, we p=
ropose novel
movement pattern concepts to access the relevance of movement patterns by d=
ealing with
time gaps. We also further present the gradual trajectory pattern notion to=
 analysis the
behavior of moving objects in a graduality point of view. 3) In the last st=
ep, we propose
an novel MDL principal-based approach, named SmartCompo to extract represen=
tative
movement patterns from moving object data. 4) Our three step framework is i=
llustrated in
a demonstration system, named Multi_Move, which is designed to extract and =
manage different
kinds of spatio-temporal patterns concurrently. A user-friendly interface i=
s provided
to facilitate interactive exploration of mining results.
