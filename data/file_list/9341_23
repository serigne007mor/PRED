The 7th International ACM Conference on Management of computational and col=
lective Intelligence
                       in Digital EcoSystems (MEDES 2015)
               In-Cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
                       http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES/15/
                             October 25-29, 2015
                       Caraguatatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil


Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponent=
ial use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environ=
ments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the web and composed of mult=
iple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services,=
 software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on =
the interactions and inter-relationships among them. With the help of the c=
omputational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* =
properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) e=
nvironments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital com=
ponents", in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved=
, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend bi=
g data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platfor=
ms.

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly=
 complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to=
 how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, i=
ntelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies =
has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resou=
rces and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting=
 business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved throu=
gh novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data m=
anagement, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interacti=
ons, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to sup=
port the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.

The International ACM Conference on Management of computational and collect=
ive IntElligence in Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring to=
gether a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industr=
y interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to res=
ource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and techn=
ologies can be evolved and adapted to this end.


Topics
-------
MEDES 2015 seeks contributions in the following areas:

1. Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
2. Green computing
3. Computational and Collective Intelligence
4. Services
5. Trust, Security & Privacy
6. Data & Knowledge Management
7. Internet of Things and Intelligent Web
8. Human-Computer Interaction
9. Networks and Protocols
10. Open Source


Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at most 8 A=
CM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with length limit=
 will be rejected.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the p=
reliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all r=
eviewer inquiries and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, revie=
wers notify authors with the final decision. Selection criteria will includ=
e: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and q=
uality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take s=
trong or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digi=
tal Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present=
 the paper.

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP.

Workshop Proposal Submission
----------------------------

Proposals for Workshops that examine emerging, innovative, or otherwise pro=
vocative issues within the conference area are encouraged. Workshop proposa=
ls should include a 1-2 page summary of the topic and the names and affilia=
tions of 3-4 chairs and program committee members who have made a commitmen=
t to participate. A mix of industry and academic panel members is recommend=
ed.

In the page summary, the organizers should present clearly:

- the motivation of the workshop and its relatedness to the topics of MEDES=
 2015,
- the specific topics covered and possible application areas,
- the reviewing process, and the expected number of participants,
- if the same workshop has been organized before in MEDES or related confer=
ences and why its continuation is needed.


Special Track Proposal Submission
---------------------------------

Special Track proposals for MEDES 2015 should include:

- The title and brief technical description of the special track, specifyin=
g its goals and motivation.
- A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this tim=
e.
- A brief description of why and to whom the track is of interest, the spec=
ial track audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
- A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have=
 to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
