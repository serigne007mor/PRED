PATTER RECOGNITION LETTERS
/Special Issue on Hierarchical Representations: New Results and
Challenges for Image Analysis/

Submission period of articles
May, 1st – 31st 2019
======================================================================

Image representations based on hierarchical, scale-space models and
other non-regular / irregular grids have become increasingly popular in
image processing and computer vision over the past decades. Indeed, they
allow a modeling of image contents at different (and complementary)
levels of scales, resolutions and semantics. Methods based on such image
representations have been able to tackle various complex challenges such
as multi-scale image segmentation, image filtering, object detection,
recognition, and more recently image characterization and understanding,
potentially involving higher level of semantics.

The proposed virtual special issue will consider extended and updated
versions of papers published at the recent ICPRAI 2018 conference as
well as submissions from anybody proposing innovative methods in the
field of image representation with emphasis, but not restricted to
computer vision and image processing, medical imaging, 2D and 3D images,
multi-modality, remote sensing image analysis, image indexation and
understanding.

*Topics:*
The main topics of this HIERARCHY virtual special issue include, but are
not limited to:

   * image decomposition on the basis of frequency spaces (Fourier,
     wavelets, etc.)
   * hierarchies linked to the image space, mathematical morphology,
     connected operators
   * scale-space representations
   * non-regular / irregular grid image representations
   * multi-scale representation in computer-vision
   * evaluation of hierarchical image representations

The aim of this special issue is to popularize the use of hierarchical
methods in image processing and analysis. Indeed, although these methods
have become very popular in computer vision over the last 20 years,
their potential impact is largely underexploited in image processing and
analysis.

*Submission:*
The review process will follow the standard PRLetters scheme. In
particular, each paper will be reviewed by two referees. The referees
will include the program committee members of the special session at
ICPRAI 2018 on the same topic and other invited referees selected from
the EES.

This is an open call-for-papers from outside the ICPRAI 2018 conference,
though participants of the virtual special session on hierarchical
representations of images will be invited to submit an extended article
of their contribution. These articles must include at least 30% of new
contribution (theoretical or experimental results), with different
figures and a different title than the one of the ICPRAI paper. The
common content between the ICPRAI paper and the HIERARCHY article cannot
be exactly the same. This virtual special issue also accepts totally new
proposals; both types of submissions must respect the following guidelines.

All submissions have to be prepared according to the Guide for Authors
as published in the Journal Web Site at
_http://www.elsevier.com/journals/pattern-recognition-letters/0167-8655/guide-for-authors_

The authors are invited to upload their article through
http://ees.elsevier.com/prletters/  during the submission period (see
previous section), by indicating the virtual special issue acronym
(HIERARCHY). Their contribution should not have been published
previously, or not be under revision for any other publication
elsewhere. In the case of an extension of ICPRAI session, the original
work must be attached, and a description of major changes must be
provided. Guest editors will judge the suitability and scope of each
contribution.

All submitted papers will be reviewed according to the guidelines and
standards of PRLetters. At least two (2) reviewers will be assigned, and
2 reviewing rounds can occur for each submitted article. The maximal
length is 7 pages, except for articles requiring major revision and
additional content by the reviewers, for which the maximal length can be
extended to 8 pages. If an article still need major revision after the
second round, it will be rejected.

Only original, high-quality, technically sound articles and in-line with
the PRLetters standard guidelines, will be considered for publication in
this virtual special issue. Submissions will be judged by their
contributions to the virtual special issue topics, clarity of
presentation, potential impact to the field, and suitability to
publication in an archival journal.
