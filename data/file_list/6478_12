PRESENTATION

------------------------------

Information systems (IS) and decision support systems (DSS) are two
complementary approaches whose joint use facilitates information
management and decision-making based on their analyses. The 2015 edition
of this special issue will aim to publish the latest advances in the
field of informatics applied to ecology, environment and/or agriculture,
focusing on information and decision system technologies. The intended
topics will range from formal systems modeling to development and
decision-making experiments. Theoretical or practical results from
multidisciplinary research works will be greatly appreciated.

Topics of interest in the field of informatics include (but are not
limited to):

* Software Implementation of Simulation Models for Decision-Making
* Impact Evaluation of IS or DSS on User Behavior
* Implementation of Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis
* DSS Based on Expert and Rule-Based Systems
* Knowledge Engineering and Management
* Use and Integration of IS for DSS
* Open Linked Data Management
* Web-Based and Distributed IS or DSS architectures
* Software and Systems Interoperability in IS or DSS
* Cloud/Grid Computing for IS or DSS
* Use of Sensors Network for Decision-Making
* Data Management and Data Mining
* Geographical Information Systems

Examples of agricultural and environmental applications include, but are
not limited to, the following:

* Agricultural Systems
* Environmental Systems
* Impact Assessments of Agricultural Activities on Ecosystems
* Environmental and Ecological Modeling
* Environmental Monitoring
* Impact of Global Climate Change
* Soil, Air and Water Quality Models
* Risk Assessment and Management
