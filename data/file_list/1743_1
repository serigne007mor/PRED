Call for papers for the 1st Workshop on "Advances in Conceptual
Knowledge Engineering"
in conjunction with DEXA 2007



http://www.dexa.org



Regensburg, Germany

3-7 September 2007


Organised by: Sadok Ben Yahia (Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, Tunisia),
Jean Diatta (IREMIA, La R=E9union Island, France) and Engelbert Mephu
Nguifo (CRIL, France)



The first attempt to define a lattice theory, as a mathematic model, was ma=
de by G. Birkhoff . An underlying deep concept is the notion of
Galois connection that emerged in the early 1940s, after a long gestation s=
ince the beginning of the 20th century. Over the last two decades, research=
 has
demonstrated how concept lattices formalize conceptual structures by coding=
 any kind of duality, such as the duality between the intent and the extent
of a concept. Application in data analysis using this duality for analyzing=
 questionnaire data was done by Barbut and Monjardet  in the domain of
social sciences. The concept lattice also named "Galois lattice" was then p=
romoted by Wille and Ganter and Wille, and then extended as a
discipline called "formal concept analysis".
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical tool for analyzing data and=
 formally representing conceptual knowledge. FCA helps forming
conceptual structures from data. Such structures consist of units, which ar=
e formal abstractions of concepts of human thought allowing meaningful and
comprehensible interpretation.
Among these communities, there are several sub-areas of research that can b=
e unified by their common interest in "concept lattices structures",
which are starting to play an important role in all computer science fields=
, as pointed out by the different special issues appeared in jETAI, JUCS
and that to appear on the forthcoming months. Thus, FCA mathematical settin=
gs have recently been shown to provide a theoretical framework for
the efficient resolution of many practical problems from data mining, data =
analysis, classification, clustering and information retrieval.


The ultimate aim of this workshop is to provide state-of-the-art informatio=
n to academics, researchers, and industry practitioners whom are involved
or interested in both theoretical and applicational aspects of formal conce=
pt analysis. Prospective authors are invited to submit original and previou=
sly
unpublished research showing related to the following topics:

** Conceptual structures,
**Relationship of FCA with other methods of data analysis (clustering,
association rules, classification, etc.),
** Data for FCA (object-attribute data, pre-processing of data, conceptual
scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.),
** Applications of FCA on semantic web and ontologies,

*** Instructions for authors and Important dates


Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research and application
papers that are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will
be limited to 5 two-column pages (IEEE Proceeding style) including figures
and references. Please comply with the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedi=
ngs
Author Guidelines to prepare your papers. Electronic submission
of manuscripts (in postscript, word or pdf format) is required and will be
handled via the workshop Web site (to be announced soon). For any further
inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact the workshop organizers.
In addition, at least one author of each accepted paper is required to atte=
nd
the conference and present the paper. Papers accepted for presentation
will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press as proceedings of the
DEXA 2007 workshops.


**Important dates:

Deadline for authors to submit papers: March 1st, 2007
Notification of review results: April 15, 2007
