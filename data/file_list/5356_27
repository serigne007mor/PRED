Workshop overview

More than ever, reducing the cost of data integration by efficiently =
evaluating queries is an important challenge, given that today the =
economic cost in computing cycles (see your cloud invoice); and in =
energy consumption and the performance required for some critical tasks =
have become important. Besides, new applications require solving even =
more complex queries including millions of sources, and data with high =
levels of volume and variety. These challenges call for intelligent =
processes that can learn from previous experiences, that can be =
adaptable to changing requirements and dynamic execution contexts.

The third edition of the workshop STRAPS aims at promoting scientific =
discussion on the way data produced under different conditions can be =
efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, analytical queries =
according to the following conditions:

These queries must cope to quality preferences associated with =
providers, algorithms and data trust.

- New scales in volume, velocity and value associated with integrated =
data collections require adapted solutions providing computing, storage =
and processing services potentially deployed on different highly =
distributed infrastructures and target architectures.

- With service, data and algorithms stemming from different and =
potentially huge numbers of providers, properties like provenance, =
quality and trust, arise as key properties to be quantified, evaluated =
and exposed to data consumers. How can data integration in such =
conditions be smart? This is the key question to be discussed by =
workshop participants.

Topics of interest
We invite the submission of work-in-progress research addressing various =
aspects of data integration and processing done in service-based =
infrastructures. The workshop welcomes submissions of technical, =
experimental, methodological papers, application papers, and papers on =
experience reports in real-life application settings addressing =E2=80=93 =
though not limited to =E2=80=93 the following topics:

- SLA models for data integration/data management
- Service based data processing and querying
- Data services composition on cloud and multi-cloud
- Trust and privacy in Cloud/Edge services
- Data and service provenance
- Data quality: evaluation, estimation, warranties
- Microservices based data integration systems
- Multi-scale data integration: learning-based, logic-based, =
(semi)-automatic, context aware, on the Web etc.
- AI and data integration / Smart Big data integration
- Data integration for smart applications
- Innovative data integration platforms
- Data Cleaning, Curation, Filtering and Dissemination, Metadata =
Management, Data Discovery, Semantic Web, Heterogeneous and Federated =
data sources
- Blockchain and data integration
- AI in Edge Computing (Edge AI)
- IoT Data integration through Edge services
- Web services in Edge clouds
- Cloud & Fog Computing
- User eXperience & Human in the loop in data integration and management

Submission instructions

We expect papers written in English between 8 and 12 Springer=E2=80=99s =
LNCS pages long (Springer LNCS format), including references and =
Illustrations. Electronic submissions in PDF format can be proposed at =
the workshop submission site: =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dstraps2021

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should =
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and =
attend the workshop to present the paper. Registration is subject to the =
terms and conditions of  ICSOC.
