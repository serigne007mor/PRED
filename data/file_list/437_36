Second International Workshop on REsource Discovery (*RED*)

August 28th, *2009*, Lyon, France

co-located with the 35th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases

A resource corresponds to an information source such as a data
repository or database management system (e.g.,
a query form or a textual search engine), a link between resources (an
index or hyperlink), or a service such
as an application or tool. Resources are characterized by core
information including a name, a description of
its input and its output (parameters or format), its address, and
various additional properties expressed as
metadata. Resource discovery is the process of identifying and locating
existing resources that have a particular
property. Machine-based resource discovery relies on crawling,
clustering, and classifying resources discovered
on the Web automatically. Resources are organized with respect to
metadata that characterize their content (for
data sources), their semantics (in terms of ontological classes and
relationships), their characteristics
(syntactical properties), their performance (with metrics and
benchmarks), their quality (curation, reliability,
trust), etc. Resource discovery systems allow the expression of queries
to identify and locate resources that
implement specific tasks.

The Second International Workshop on Resource Discovery co-located with
VLDB aims at bringing together researchers,
developers, and practitioners to discuss research issues and experience
in developing and deploying concepts,
applications, and solutions addressing various issues related to
resource discovery. Papers presenting either
theoretical or applicative material are expected. Because of the dynamic
research and development effort towards
supporting resource discovery for the life sciences, we expect to
receive many contributions in the scope of this
very exciting application domain. However, we encourage the submission
of generic solutions or the presentation
of application experiences other than related to life sciences.


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
---------------------------------------------------
• Classification, indexing, registration, and publication of resources
• Resource metadata, semantics, statistics, digests, relevance measures,
and metrics
• Data and data source discovery
• Service publication standards (UDDI, OWL-S, etc.), Web services,
BioMoby services
• Resource Discovery and ontologies
• Resource Discovery query languages
• Discovering resource on the public Web, on the private Web, on a grid
• Discovering agents, peers, services
• Querying against integrated discovered resources
• Cost-models for Resource Discovery
• Optimization and Resource Discovery
• QoS-based Resource Discovery
• Discovering and composing resources
