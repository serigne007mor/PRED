The institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology (iSSB) has an immediate =
opening for a postdoctoral position in the field of machine learning for =
systems biology.

We invite applications from researchers who hold  a PhD in machine =
learning, biostatistics, computational system biology or a related =
field.=20

The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team of =
computational and molecular biologists =
(http://www.issb.genopole.fr/Research/teams/mega =
<http://www.issb.genopole.fr/Research/teams/mega>), working on a cancer =
system biology project (involving Radvanyi lab - institut Curie and =
Southgate lab - York University) : LIONs  (Large-scale Integrative =
approach to unravel the relationships between differentiatiON and =
tumorigenesiS ) funded by ITMO cancer/ INSERM =

015.pdf =
<https://www.eva2.inserm.fr/EVA/jsp/Resultats/CANCER/E-Laureats_AO_PC_BS-2=
015.pdf>).  She/He will be responsible for developing machine-learning =
algorithms for regulatory network inference and interrogation. We will =
use high-throughput heterogeneous data (miRNA and mRNA isoform =
expression) and protein data of bladder tumors and normal urothelial =
cells at different stages of proliferation/differentiation to infer, =
analyze and compare the regulatory networks =E2=80=94 transcription =
factors, miRNA and target genes =E2=80=94 found in the normal and =
pathological states. This work will build on the previous studies =
carried out by our team to model gene regulation in both discrete and a =
continuous frameworks. It will also involve extensive ci-regulatory =
element analysis and tools for mathematical studies of a perturbation =
model combining inferred normal and tumoral regulatory networks with =
heterogeneous tumor data (DNA methylation, mutations and genomic =
alterations). Key candidate genes from deregulated pathways encoding =
regulators or therapeutic targets will be validated functionally.

The successful candidate will be offered an initial contract for 24 =
months with possible extension for an additional 12 months depending on =
performance.=20

The iSSB is part of Genopole, the premier French BioPark of leading =
research academic and private laboratories in biotechnology, genomics, =
post-genomics and related sciences. It is located in Evry (Paris =
region).

Applicants should send a full CV, the contact details of three referees, =
and a cover letter to Dr. Mohamed Elati =
