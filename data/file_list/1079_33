ICDM '10: The 10th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining
*******************************************************

Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society
December 13-17, 2010, Sydney, Australia
http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/icdm10

Important Dates
***************
Apr 14, 2010:     Deadline for workshop proposals
May 06, 2010:     Deadline for ICDM contest proposals
Jul 02, 2010:     Deadline for full paper submission

The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has established 
itself as the world's
premier research conference in data mining. The 10th edition of ICDM 
(ICDM '10) provides a
leading forum for presentation of original research results, as well as 
exchange and dissemination
of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers 
all aspects of data mining,
including algorithms, software and systems, and applications. In 
addition, ICDM draws researchers
and application developers from a wide range of data mining related 
areas such as statistics, machine
learning, pattern recognition, databases and data warehousing, data 
visualization, knowledge-based
systems, and high performance computing. By promoting novel, high 
quality research findings, and
innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, the conference 
seeks to continuously advance
the state-of-the-art in data mining. Besides the technical program, the 
conference will feature
workshops,tutorials, panels, and the ICDM data mining contest.

Paper Submissions
*****************

High quality papers in all data mining areas are solicited. Original 
papers exploring new directions will
receive especially careful consideration. Papers that have already been 
accepted or are currently under
review for other conferences or journals will not be considered for ICDM 
'10.

Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages in the IEEE 
2-column format
(http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting). All papers will 
be double-blind reviewed by the
Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to data 
mining, originality, significance, and
clarity. Papers that do not comply with the Submission Guidelines
(http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/icdm10/index.php/paper-submissions/submission-guidelines)
will be rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the 
IEEE Computer Society
Press and accorded oral presentation times in the main conference. 
Submissions accepted as
regular papers will be allocated 10 pages in the proceedings. 
Submissions accepted as short
papers will be allocated 6 pages in the proceedings and will have a 
shorter presentation time
at the conference than regular papers.

A selected number of IEEE ICDM '10 accepted papers will be invited for 
possible inclusion, in expanded and revised form, in the Knowledge and 
Information Systems journal published by Springer-Verlag.

Please click here 
(http://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/icdm10/scripts/submit.php) to submit your 
papers to ICDM2010.

ICDM Best Paper Awards
**********************
IEEE ICDM Best Paper Awards will be conferred at the conference on the 
authors of (1) the best research paper, (2) the best application paper, 
and (3) the best student paper. Strong, foundational results will be 
considered for the best research paper award and application
-oriented submissions will be considered for the best application paper 
award. The best student paper award will be given to the authors of the 
best paper written solely by one or more students.

Workshops and Tutorials
***********************
ICDM '10 will host short and long tutorials as well as workshops that 
focus on new research directions and initiatives. All accepted workshop 
papers will be included in a separate workshop proceedings published by 
the IEEE Computer Society Press.

ICDM Data Mining Contest
************************
ICDM '10 will host a data mining contest to challenge researchers and 
practitioners with a real practical data mining problem. For further 
details on proposals and expression of interest, please click here 
(http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/icdm10/index.php/call-for/icdm-contest-call-for-proposal) 
to see Call for Data Mining Contest Proposals.

ICDM Data Mining demos and exhibits
************************
ICDM '10 will host demos and exhibits. The exhibitors will be given the 
opportunity to distribute product,
service, and company literature, give demonstrations and carry out 
recruitment activities.
Demos are solicited for demonstrating data mining software systems and 
libraries closely related
to the area of data mining and knowledge discovery, or showing new
technological advances in applying data mining techniques.
Please click here 
(http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/icdm10/index.php/call-for/call-for-demo) to 
see Call for Demos.

Topics of Interest
*****************
Topics related to the design, analysis and implementation of data mining 
theory, systems and applications are of interest. These include, but are 
not limited to the following areas: data mining foundations, mining in 
emerging domains, methodological aspects and the KDD process, and 
integrated KDD applications, systems, and experiences. A detailed 
listing of specific topics can be found at the conference website 
(http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/icdm10/index.php/topic-of-interest).
