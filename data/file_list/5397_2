General information
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or =
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in =
the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn =
Shafer as a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty. These =
early contributions have been the starting points of many important =
developments, including the transferable belief model and the theory of =
hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a =
general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well =
understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, =
possibility and imprecise probability theories. It has been applied in =
diverse areas such as machine learning, information fusion and risk =
analysis.

The BELIEF conferences (sponsored by the Belief Functions and =
Applications Society https://www.bfasociety.org/ =
<https://www.bfasociety.org/>) are dedicated to the confrontation of =
ideas, the reporting of recent achievements and the presentation of the =
wide range of applications of this theory. Previous BELIEF conferences =
have been held in Brest (2010), Compi=C3=A8gne (2012, 2018), Oxford =
(2014), and Prague (2016). This edition of the conference will be =
located in Shanghai, China, on October 15-17, 2021, together with the =
2021 International Conference on Cognitive analytics, Granular =
computing, and Three-way decisions (CCGT). It will be held both onsite =
and online due to the COVID-19 situation.
