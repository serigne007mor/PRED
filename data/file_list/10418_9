ICFCA 2015

13th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis

June 23 - 26, 2015, Nerja, Spain

http://www.matap.uma.es/icfca2015/index.html

=======================================================
================================================================================

What is it?

Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980's from attempts to
restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication
between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since
its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research
field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a
rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge
processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and
knowledge management and discovery.

The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners
working on theoretical or applied aspects of Formal Concept Analysis
within major related areas such as Mathematics and Computer and
Information Sciences and their diverse applications to fields like
Software Engineering, Linguistics, Life and Social Sciences, etc.

Main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Fundamental aspects of FCA
- FCA theory
- Lattice theory
- Lattice drawing
- Philosophical foundations
- Algorithms and complexity theory

Bridging FCA to information sciences and artificial intelligence
- FCA and logic (semantic web, description logics, ...)
- FCA and conceptual structures (concept graphs, knowledge space, ...)
- FCA and data analysis (hierarchical classification, data organization, 
...)
- FCA and data mining (pattern mining)
- FCA and machine learning (learning with hypothesis, feature selection, 
...)
- FCA and database theory (dependencies, rules, data cubes, ...)
- FCA and software engineering
- FCA and morphological mathematics

Understanding, modelling real-world data and phenomena with FCA
- Analysis of "big data" with FCA (sampling, parallel computing, ...)
- Analysis of social networks and their dynamics
- Applications for scientific data analysis (in biology, health, ...)
- Applications for sensors data and user interactions traces
- Other FCA applications

Submission Details

We invite scientific publications on theory and applications of Formal
Concept Analysis. Papers of up to sixteen pages may be submitted in
the PDF or Postscript format via the Easychair system
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfca2015. For each paper,
an abstract must be submitted by January 16, 2015. Authors are
requested to follow the formatting instructions for the Springer LNCS
style, see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Accepted papers must be presented at the conference, therefore at
least one author per paper has to register timely. All submissions
will be refereed, and the conference proceedings will be published by
Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.

Important Dates

Submission of abstract: January 16 2015
