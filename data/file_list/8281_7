		Call for Papers for a Special Issue on

Advanced Data Stream Management and Processing of Continuous Queries

			      in TLDKS

		International Journal Transactions on

	   Large-Scale Data and Knowledge Centered Systems

		       (LNCS Journal Subline)

			 http://tldks.faw.at

	     Extended Deadline : March 15, 2013

Guest editors:

    * Bernd Amann, LIP6 - UPMC, Paris, France.
    * Philippe Lamarre, LIRIS - INSA Lyon, France.

Scope:

An increasing number of applications continuously (24/7/365) produce
and consume high volumes of streaming data. Examples of such
applications include sensor and RFID networks for smart buildings and
cities, environmental monitoring and health-care, network message
tracing, online user feedback analysis, web syndication, social media,
RSS feed aggregation, video surveillance and security, finance and
stock market analysis, scientific workflows, etc. Following the
traditional database principles, Data Stream Management Systems
alleviate the development of this kind of applications by proposing
high-level and efficient data stream processing interfaces through
declarative data models and query languages. In this kind of systems,
data processing complexity comes from the need to evaluate many
complex (long-running) queries over large numbers of high-speed data
streams. This context introduces many new challenges from different
theoretical and practical points of view.

The objective of the TLDKS special issue on Advanced Data Stream
Management and Continuous Query Processing is to provide an
opportunity to disseminate original research contributions and a high
quality communication platform for researchers and
practitioners. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

       * Advanced Data Stream Models and Query Languages
       * Continuous Query Processing and Optimization
       * Data Stream Management and Warehousing
       * Data Stream Mining
       * Approximate Data Stream Processing and Sampling
       * Probabilistic Data Streams
       * Theory of Data Stream Computing
       * Continuous Top-k Query Processing
       * System Performance and Evaluation
