Subject: [liste-egc] Offre de Master 2: smart mining of sequences with ASP /
 IRISA-DREAM

L'équipe DREAM (IRISA/INRIA) et l'université de Potsdam proposent un
sujet de stage de M2 sur la fouille déclarative de motifs séquentiels,
en lien avec la programmation logique (Answer Set Programming). Le sujet
est décrit ci-dessous.

Les candidats d'excellent niveau, étant intéressés par la programmation
logique et les approches déclaratives de la fouille de motifs peuvent
candidater, avant le 25 novembre, par mail à T. Guyet et R. Quiniou
(détails de soumission en fin de sujet).

N'hésitez pas à diffuser.

The main objective of this internship is to explore a declarative
programming language - Anwser Set Programming - to design sequential
pattern mining approaches that enable the analyst to integrate expert
knowledge into the mining process. There is a recent interest in
developing generic pattern mining approaches, i.e. methods that may
extract different kinds of patterns (itemsets, sequences, etc.). On the
other side, there is a strong requirement for extracting the most
significant patterns. Dedicated algorithms are very efficient but they
have lots of difficulties to manage complex expert knowledge and they
generate numerous meaningless patterns. Enabling the analyst to express
complex knowledge about the patterns or about the data he is interested
in, is a new research direction in the data mining community. Some work
has been done using constraint programming. These approaches show the
effectiveness of the declarative pattern mining but they are still
difficult to handle by non-experts in constraint programming.

Our objective is to develop generic pattern mining methods with Answer
Set Programming. ASP combines an efficient solver and a very expressive
language. An ASP program is composed of a set of logical formulas,
expressing the background knowledge related to the problem to be solved,
and a set of logical constraints on the solutions of the problem.
Therefore, it appears to be a good candidate for constraint-based
mining. 

This internship is focused on sequential pattern mining. This task is
still challenging for declarative pattern mining approaches and, in
addition, it provides the analyst with many opportunities to define very
complex constraints on the patterns and on the data.
The data to be processed during this internship comes from the PEPS
project (Pharmaco-epidemiology of Health Products). In collaboration
with the Rennes Hospital, we are interested in characterizing the care
pathways from a large database provided by the french health insurance.

The internship will be located in Rennes and will be supervised by both
researchers in pattern mining (IRISA/DREAM) and researchers in logic
programming, namely T. Schaub from Potsdam University. T. Schaub leads
the development of one of the most efficient ASP solver, clingo. The
funding possibly includes a visit to the Potsdam group.


The candidate should have strong interests in formal methods. Some
background in logic programming, especially Answer Set Programming,
constraint programming or data mining would be appreciate.

Applications should by addressed to : rene.quiniou@inria.fr and
thomas.guyet@irisa.fr before november the 25th, with the following
pieces of information: 1 CV, 1 motivation letter, at least one recent
transcript (master degree) and, possibly, recommendation letters and
some technical realizations description (must be available upon
request).
