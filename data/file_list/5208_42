MACLEAN: MAChine Learning for EArth ObservatioN (MACLEAN@ECML/PKDD21)

September 2021, Online Event

KEY DATES
  Paper submission deadline: June 23, 2021
  Paper acceptance notification: July 23, 2021
  Paper camera-ready deadline: Monday, July 30, 2021

CONTEXT
  The huge amount of data currently produced by modern Earth Observation =
(EO) missions has raised up new challenges for the Remote Sensing =
communities. EO sensors are now able to offer (very) high spatial =
resolution images with revisit time frequencies never achieved before =
considering different kind of signals, e.g., multi-(hyper)spectral =
optical, radar, LiDAR and Digital Surface Models. In this context, =
modern machine learning techniques can play a crucial role to deal with =
such amount of heterogeneous, multi-scale and multi-modal data. Some =
examples of techniques that are gaining attention  in  this  domain  =
include  deep  learning,  domain  adaptation,  semi-supervised approach, =
time series analysis and active learning. Even though the use of machine =
learning and the development of ad-hoc techniques are gaining increasing =
popularity in the EO domain, we can witness that a significant lack of =
interaction between domain experts and machine learning researchers =
still exists. The objective of this workshop is to supply an =
international forum where machine learning researchers and =
domain-experts can meet each other, in order to exchange, debate and =
draw short and long term research objectives around the exploitation and =
analysis of EO data via Machine Learning techniques. Among the =
workshop=E2=80=99s objectives, we want to give an overview of the =
current machine learning researches dealing with EO data, and, on the =
other hand, we want to stimulate concrete discussions to pave the way to =
new machine learning frameworks especially tailored to deal with such =
data.

two types: either short position papers (up to 6 pages including =
references) or full research papers (up to 10 pages including =
references). Papers must be written in LNCS format, i.e., accordingly to =
the ECML-PKDD 2021 submission format.  Accepted contributions will be =
