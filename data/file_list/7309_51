Lyon, France

Ming Social Network Dynamics Workshop (MSND) aims at gathering=20=20
researchers from the fields of social computing, machine learning, and=20=20
data mining to think about the obstacles that hurdle the leveraging of=20=20
understanding and capturing of social network dynamics. We target=20=20
researchers from both industry and academia to join forces in this=20=20
exciting area. We intend to discuss the recent and significant=20=20
developments in the general area of mining social network dynamics and=20=20
to promote cross-fertilization of techniques. In particular, we aim at=20=20
identifying techniques from the data mining and machine learning=20=20
fields that will enable researchers to understand the dynamic=20=20
phenomena in social networks and social media, as well as specify=20=20
important directions for the research communities. Understanding,=20=20
capturing, mining and being able to predict dynamic behaviors is=20=20
interesting for several areas such as marketing, security, and Web=20=20
search.
Exciting news: MSND will include a special session around social=20=20
networks for journalism. This session was initially planed and=20=20
