The ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic
Information Systems 2008 (ACM GIS 2008) is the sixteenth event of a
series of symposia and workshops that began in 1993 with the aim of
bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners
carrying out research and development in novel systems based on
geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary
discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information
systems. The conference provides a forum for original research
contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation
aspects of GIS ranging from applications, user interface
considerations, and visualization down to storage management and
indexing issues. This yearï¿½s conference builds on last yearï¿½s
conference great success and on being the premier annual conference of
the newly formed ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM
SIGSPATIAL). Researchers, students, and practitioners are invited to
submit their contributions to this yearï¿½s ACM GIS.
