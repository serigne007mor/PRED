 ICCS 2014: 21st International Conference on Conceptual Structures
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Scope and Significance
 *******************************************************

 The International Conferences on Conceptual Structures (ICCS) focus on
 the formal analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge with
 applications to artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and
 related areas of computer science. The ICCS conferences evolved from a
 series of seven annual workshops on conceptual graphs, starting with an
 informal gathering hosted by John F. Sowa in 1986. Recently, 
 graph-based
 knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are getting more
 and more attention. The aim of the ICCS 2014 conference is to build 
 upon
 its long standing expertise in graph-based KRR and focus on providing
 modelling, formal and application results of graph-based systems.

 ICCS 2014 will be held in Iaşi, România at the Al. I. Cuza University
 (http://www.uaic.ro/ ), the oldest higher education institution in
 România. The university was founded one year after the establishment of
 the Romanian state in 1860. Iaşi has a long tradition in higher
 education and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of
 Romanian social, cultural, academic and artistic life.

 The conference welcomes contributions that address graph-based
 representation and reasoning paradigms (e.g. Bayesian Networks (BNs),
 Semantic Networks (SNs), RDF(S), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal 
 Concept
 Analysis (FCA), CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, Argumentation, Graph Databases, 
 etc.)
 from a modelling, theoretical and application viewpoint:

 .    Modelling results will investigate concrete real world needs for
 graph-based representation, how certain use cases are of interest to 
 the
 graph community, how using graphs can bring added (business) value, 
 what
 kind of graph representation is needed for a given case etc.

 .    Technical results will include fundamental graph theory based
 results for novel structures for representation, extensions of existing
 structures for added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms
 for reasoning, reasoning explanation, etc.

 .    Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to
 demonstrate the benefits of the graph-based proposed solutions in the
 context of the use case studied with respect to other possible 
 solutions.

 The conference also welcomes papers on the following topics:
 .    Knowledge Management,
 .    Knowledge Architectures,
 .    Reasoning under Inconsistency,
 .    Knowledge Representation and Uncertainty,
 .    Contextual Logic,
 .    Metaphoric, Cultural or Semiotic Considerations,
 .    Ontologies,
 .    Semantic Web,
 .    Web of Data,
 .    Web 2.0,
 .    Conceptual Knowledge Acquisition,
 .    Data Mining,
 .    Text Mining,
 .    Natural Language Processing,
 .    Linguistics,
 .    Constraint Satisfaction,
 .    Decision Making,
 .    Resource Allocation and
 .    Agreement Technologies.
