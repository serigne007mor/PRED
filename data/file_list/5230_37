==== Call for papers UDML 2021 workshop @ ICDM 2021 ======= ** 4th
International Workshop on Utility-Driven Mining and Learning ** in
conjunction with the 21th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining
(ICDM 2021) December 7, 2021, Auckland, New Zealand Scope =====
Utility-driven mining and learning from data has received emerging
attentions from KDD communities due to its high potential in wide
applications, covering finance, biomedicine, manufacturing, e-commerce,
social media, etc. Some current research topics in utility-driven mining
focused are for example to discover patterns of high value (eg, high
profit) in large databases, analyzing/learning the important factors (eg,
economic factors) in the data mining or machine learning process, and
learning models that optimize some given utility functions. One of the
popular applications of utility mining and learning is the analysis of
large transactional databases to discover high-utility itemsets, which
consist of sets of items that generate a high profit when purchased
together. The workshop aims at bringing together academic and industrial
researchers and practitioners from data mining, machine learning and other
interdisciplinary communities, in the collaborative effort of identifying
and discussing major technical challenges, recent results and potential
topics on the emerging fields of Utility-Driven Mining and Learning. This
workshop will focus on real world experiences, inherent challenges, as well
as new research methods/applications. Following the success of the UDML
2018 , UDML 2019 , and UDML 2020 , the fourth Utility-Driven Mining and
Learning (UDML 2021) workshop will discuss a broad variety of topics
related to utility-driven mining and learning, including: - Theory and core
methods for utility mining and learning - Utility pattern mining in large
datasets - Analysis and learning of novel utility factors in data mining
and machine learning processes - Predictive modeling/learning, clustering
and link analysis that incorporate utility factors - Game-theoretic
multiagent system - Utility-based decision-making, planning and negotiation
- Models for utility optimizations and maximization - Utility mining and
learning in dynamic databases - Utility mining and learning in IoT
environment - Utility mining and learning in streams - Utility mining and
learning in big data - Knowledge representations for utility patterns -
Knowledge integration and fusion of utility patterns - Privacy preserving
and security issues in utility mining/learning - AI and ML models
incorporated with utility-driven concept - Visualization techniques for
utility mining/learning - Open-source software/libraries/platform -
Innovative applications in interdisciplinary domains - New, open, or
unsolved problems in utility-driven mining and learning Organizing
