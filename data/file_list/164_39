CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION
Thanks
to progress performed by the knowledge engineering area, powerful
methods for designing and use of ontologies are provided. As a result,
the scientific and industrial communities have gained access to an
increasing number of ontologies and terminologies. For instance, within
the biomedical area, several dozens of orthogonal or generic ontologies
and terminologies are currently available thanks to the OBO (Open
Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) or UMLS initiatives: the
objective is to make them interoperable and hence reusable.

The usage of an ontology or terminology is often characterized by
several factors between which we would name: application, scientific or
technical domain, language of data and of documents to be processed,
user profile, etc. All of them influence the content and organization
of the semantic resources (terminologies and ontologies). Exploitation
of these resources in this original context ensures their optimal use
and results.

We assume that reuse of such resources implies that at least one of the
designing factors is modified: application, user, domain ... Hence, the
reuse implies also that an adaptation of ontologies and terminologies
is performed. This process appears to be necessary in order to
guarantee an optimized exploitation of the reused ontologies and
terminologies.

=20
OBJECTIVES
Further
to recent evolution of the knowledge engineering area and to emergence
of new context related to the reuse and adaptation of ontologies and
terminologies, several questions have arised and still arise. We
propose to address them in this workshop and encourage submissions on
topics related to questions such as:

- Which areas have developed and currently provide freely available ontolog=
ies and terminologies?
-
Are these ontologies and terminologies specific to a given application,
sub-domain or rather generic and descriptive of the area?

- At which extend the existing ontologies and terminologies may be reused?
- Whether the existing ontologies can be adapted to new purposes?
- Is their adaptation a suitable process?
- Is their adaptation less expensive than the designing of new ontologies?

- What knowledge elements can be reused: terms, concepts, relations, roles,=
 definitions ...?
- Are terminologies more easily reusable than ontologies?
- What methods and principles should be exploited for the adaptation and re=
use of the existing ontologies?

- How the mapping of ontologies may be helpful for their reuse?
- Which role play corpora in adaptation of terminologies and ontologies?
-
Are Natural Language Processing methods helpful in the process of
adaptation of terminologies and ontologies? If they are, which of them
prove to be suitable?

- ...
This workshop may also be concerned
with questions related to managing of the evolution of ontologies and
their versioning and to analysis of evolution of their content (i.e.,
concept emergence, removal, abstraction or specialisation), especially
when combined with questions cited above.
