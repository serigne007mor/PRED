INTRODUCTION and MOTIVATION

TIA 2013 will be the 10th in a series of successful events which, for=20
the most part, initially took place in the francophone world. Over a=20
period of almost 20 years (the first conference was held in 1995) TIA=20
has increasingly attracted the attention of many researchers and=20
practitioners all over the world, and its work has become truly=20
international.
The aim of TIA 2013 is to provide an overview of the new ways in which=20
multilingual terminology is present in an ever-increasing networked=20
society, and to pay special attention both to the methods applied in the=20
conceptualization of domain knowledge and to the applications and tools=20
that will meet the requirements of e-society. In this way, terminology,=20
linguistics and knowledge engineering provide the basis on which many=20
other disciplines develop their applications such as domain ontologies,=20
natural language processing tools, multilingual knowledge-based tools=20
and web-based linguistic applications. New approaches to the=20
standardization and to the reuse and integration of different tools=20
designed to facilitate work in institutions, companies and society in=20
general will be welcome.

The TIA 2013 Conference aims to promote interdisciplinary research=20
focusing on the intersection of different disciplines that deal with=20
terminological aspects and knowledge engineering resources. Papers may=20
address both theoretical questions and methodological aspects on these=20
issues, as well as interdisciplinary approaches developed to facilitate=20
convergence and co-operation in terminological aspects of importance to=20
society.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Terminology and ontology acquisition and management
- Applying pattern recognition to enriching terminological resources
- Lexicons, thesauri and ontologies as semantic resources
- Lexicons and ontologies as means for knowledge transfer
- Reusing, standardizing and merging terminological or ontological resources
- Multilingual terminology extraction
- Multilinguality and multimodality in terminological resources
- Management of language resources

Terminology and knowledge representation
- Ontological semantics and linguistics
- Ontology localization
- Development of multimedia terminological resources
- Terminology alignment in parallel corpora and other lexical resources
- Representation of terms and conceptual relations in knowledge-based=20
applications
- Comparative studies of terminological resources and/or ontological=20
resources from different languages, domains and approaches
- Terminological resources in the 21st century
- Harmonization of format and standards in terminological resources

Terminology and ontologies for applications
- Interoperability and reusability in knowledge-based tools and=20
applications
- Models and metamodels in annotating semantic and terminological resources
- New R &D directions in terminology for industrial uses and needs


SUBMISSIONS

TIA 2013 solicits both regular papers, which present significant work,=20
and short papers, which typically present work in progress or a smaller,=20
focused contribution. The program committee may decide to change the=20
category of a paper before acceptance. Papers can be written either in=20
English or French.
Regular papers should not exceed 8 pages in ACL-HLT 2011 format (see=20
below for LaTeX and MS Word style files), including figures, examples=20
and references. The mode of presentation of long papers (orally or as=20
posters) will be decided based on the nature rather than on the quality=20
of the work.
Short papers should not exceed 4 pages in the same format as regular=20
papers. They will also be presented orally or as posters at the=20
conference depending on the nature of the work.

Authors should submit the papers in PDF through the TIA submission page at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtia2013
At the submission page, the author(s) must provide the following=20
information:
1. name(s) of author(s)
2. affiliation(s), addresses, fax and e-mail
3. title of the paper
4. 5 to 10 key words in English or in French (in both languages if possible)
5. abstract in English or in French (in both languages if possible) (200=20
words maximum for each)
As the reviewing will be blind, the paper itself must not include the=20
authors' names and affiliations at submission time. Furthermore,=20
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously=20
showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such=20
as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Reviews of full papers=20
(long and short) will be performed by three reviewers.

STYLES FILES

Authors are required to use the following style files so that the papers=20
follow the conference format.
Latex: tia2013latex.tgz
MS Word: tia2013word.zip
IMPORTANT: Remove authors' information from your manuscripts when=20
submitting them for blind review (see above)!
