*Call for Papers*
---------------
The Fourth International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held during September 24-26 September, 2014 in Larnaca, Cyprus. 
The main objective of theconference is to provide a forum for the 
dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction 
and collaboration of research communities issued from modelling and 
system modelling on the one hand and data and data modelling on the 
other hand. MEDI 2014 provides an international infrastructure for the 
presentation of research results and experimentations on models and data 
theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data 
and their advanced applications and case studies. This international 
scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean 
countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific 
networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges and of other parts of 
the world as well.

*Aim and Scope *
-------------
Specific areas of interest to MEDI'2014 include but are not limited to:

*Modelling and Models Engineering *
     - Design of General-purpose Modelling Languages and Related Standards
     - Model Driven Engineering, Modelling Languages, Meta-modelling,

*Submission Guidelines and Instructions *
--------------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers 
representing original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be 
submitted in PDF or Word format.
Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should not exceed 
12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices). 
Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages 
with the indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the 
paper is accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format 
and/or which do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra page 
purchase commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers 
will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, 
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be
published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by 
Springer-Verlag. Duplicate submissions are not allowed. A submission is 
considered to be a duplicate submission if it is submitted to other 
conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already accepted to be 
published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions 
thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require 
explicit consent from all listed authors.
