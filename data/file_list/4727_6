Subject: [liste-egc] [FAIR heritage] call for poster and participation

-----------------------------------

*International Conference:
*Fair Heritage: Digital Methods, Scholarly Editing and Tools for
Cultural and Natural Heritage*
*

http://www.lestudium-ias.com/event/fair-heritage-digital-methods-scholarl=
y-editing-and-tools-cultural-and-natural-heritage=20



-----------------------------------

*When and Where*: 17-19 June 2020, Tours, France

*IMPORTANT DATES*

Abstract submission: 31 March 2020
Notification of acceptance: 15 April 2020

*Registration*: no costs for participation; registration is however
mandatory!

-----------------------------------

*Scope*

A plethora of data about cultural and/or natural heritage is nowadays
available to both public and private institutions (e.g., universities,
libraries, archives, museums, etc.). These data are highly heterogeneous
in terms of both formats and contents. In addition, the way in which
they are organized and characterized depends on the socio-cultural
contexts of different working communities, their research methodologies,
languages, and ways of thinking. As a consequence of this heterogeneity,
it is hard to find connections across multiple datasets or to agree on
data publishing policies and shared vocabularies to describe data in a
common manner.

Researchers and stakeholders challenge this situation by relying on
theories, methodologies, and technologies developed in areas such as
Linguistics, Conceptual modeling, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence,
Knowledge representation and reasoning. These research efforts are
characterized by a strong interdisciplinary nature and their methods are
nowadays largely exploited in Social Sciences and Humanities (including
Digital Humanities).

The purpose of the conference is to bring together multiple research
communities and stakeholders working with Open Science and FAIR
principles in the context of heritage studies. As advocated by the
European Commission, FAIR principles play a decisive role to define
guidelines and valuable tools for managing data in robust ways. We are
particularly interested in research questions addressing both
methodological and application challenges emerging from data management
practices (e.g., data modeling, sharing, integration, analysis, etc.).
The conference will provide guidance and ensure the sustainability and
implementation of the FAIR model in the context of the European Open
Science Cloud. For this purpose to be achieved, the conference will host
*practical sessions* where participants can familiarize with existing
methods and tools, and can present their own applications.

-----------------------------------

Topics of interest for *poster presentation* include (but are not
limited to):

- Sustainability of FAIR principles for cultural/natural heritage
knowledge representation and data management;
- Current social challenges for the reuse of research datasets,
including policies for data reuse;
- Scholarly Digital Editing of primary sources, including written artefac=
ts;
- Evidence based Digital Autoptic Processes on written and non-written
artefacts;
- Books as 3D cultural heritage objects;
- Foundational challenges about knowledge representation and data
management for cultural/natural heritage;
- Ontologies for geo-spatial or temporal knowledge representation and
data management;
- Lessons learned from the use of ontologies like CIDOC-CRM or FRBR(oo);
- Methodologies, languages, and tools for ontology mapping, including
ontology-based data access (OBDA) approaches;
- Semantic characterization of visual data, e.g., 3D models, 2D+ models,
point-cloud sets, etc.;
   - Software applications for cultural/natural heritage data management
(e.g., Web platforms, data visualisation tools, etc.);
