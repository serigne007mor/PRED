                     Call for Papers - Globe 2010


Third International Conference on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems

September 1-2, 2010, Bilbao, Spain

Conference URL:    http://www.dexa.org or http://www.irit.fr/globe10

Proceedings:

All accepted conference papers will be published in: LNCS - Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science - Springer Verlag (http://www.springer.com/lncs).

Scope:

Research topics such as Grid and Peer-to-Peer computing are relatively 
recent. They are important for scale distributed systems and 
applications that require effective management of voluminous, 
distributed, and heterogeneous data. This importance comes out of 
characteristics offered by these systems: the autonomy and the 
dynamicity of peers, the decentralization of control, and the effective 
and transparent sharing of large-scale distributed resources. Today, 
Grid and P2P systems open towards the management of large,
distributed, and heterogeneous data which raises new problems and 
presents new challenges.

The main objective of this international conference on Data Management 
in Grid and P2P Systems is to present the latest results in research and 
applications, to identify new issues, and to shape future directions.
