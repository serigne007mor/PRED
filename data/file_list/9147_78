MODA 2015: Management of Ontology-Driven Architectures
1st International Workshop in the framework of the
13th International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management
and Applications (SERA 2015)

May 13 - 15, 2015, Hammamet - Tunisia


Website: moda2015.ypbl.net

SCOPE

From the very initial stages of design, smart distributed and collaborative
software systems entail the incorporation of adequate autonomic
capabilities to cope with their short- and long-term architectural
evolution. For such smart and autonomic distributed and collaborative
software, structural and behavioral semantic specifications become vital
for their design, development and runtime management. One promising
approach consists in extending the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) by
integrating it with the semantic dimension of autonomic properties. This
approach can be based on the definition of ontology for CIM, PIM and PSM
level models. As a result, the semantic specifications of such systems can
be obtained through the integration of such ontology based models with the
autonomic properties of self-configuration, self-optimization,
self-protection and self-healing. The purpose of this track is to explore
and disseminate research work in the area of Management of Ontology-Driven
Architectures (MODA). The objective of MODA is to cope with the complexity
involved in designing, developing and maintaining smart and autonomic
distributed and collaborative software by integrating a variety of
architectural approaches, standards, languages and models. Additionally,
MODA would take into account the required autonomic strategies of
monitoring, analysis, planning and executing in order to ensure that
functional and non-functional requirements are properly considered. This
first MODA track proposes an ideal context for presenting achievements,
surveys and perspectives in the area of ontology-driven approaches applied
to software architecture.

Topics of Interest

The topics suggested by this track can be presented in the form of state of
the art, research, standards, implementations, experiments, specialized
applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit
complete unpublished papers, in the following topic areas:

Ontology-driven software design, development, adaptation and evolution:
Unified process (UP) and agile methodologies guided by ontologies
Software requirements specification and traceability, design patterns,
quality assurance, software validation and verification based on ontologies
Ontology-driven software evolution
Autonomic computing based on monitoring, analysis, planning and execution
guided by ontology-based knowledge base
Ontology-driven management of software architecture:
Service oriented architecture (SOA)
Service component architecture (SCA/OSGi)
Event-driven architecture (EDA)
Business process (BPMN/BPEL) and enterprise service bus (ESB)
Service composition, orchestration and choreography
Ontology-driven Cloud Computing Architectures
Ontology-driven Big Data Architectures
