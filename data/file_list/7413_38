                      Book on Security and Privacy preserving in Social Net=
works

l Networks)

Description and Objectives
---------------------------

Online social networks provide users, within their platforms, powerful ways=
 to interact with other users through different forms and modalities.
Consequently, each user can search and check the profiles of her social net=
work members (for various reasons), exchange messages with some of them, pu=
blish some photos, and post comments on shared photos, etc.
Although such tools are attracting continuously more and more users, severa=
l security and privacy problems related to their usage are emerging.
For instance, how to provide users with an easy way to protect their shared=
 data? How to protect a data repository (e.g., photo album) while several r=
elated information about the same content is already published (by some use=
r friends) on the same or other blog/wiki/social network? How to define pub=
lication strategies? etc.

The general aim of this book is to assess the current approaches and techno=
logies, as well as to outline the major challenges and future perspectives,=
 related to the security and privacy protection of social networks.
It provides an overview of the state of the art, latest techniques, studies=
, and approaches as well as future directions in this field, by including a=
 wide range of interdisciplinary contributions from various research groups.

The primary target audience for the book includes researchers, scholars, po=
stgraduate students and developers who are interested in social network sec=
urity and protection.
