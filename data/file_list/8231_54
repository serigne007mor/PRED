Call for Papers

---------------
The Third International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held during September 25-27 in Amantea, Calabria, Italy. The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for 
the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 2013 provides an international platform for the 
presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by 
researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.

Submission Guidelines and Instructions
--------------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or Word format. Submissions must conform to 
Springer's LNCS format and should not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices). Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages with the 
indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the paper is accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra 
page purchase commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. All 
accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Duplicate submissions are not allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if it 
is submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already accepted to be published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions thus will be automatically rejected 
without reviews. Submissions require explicit consent from all listed authors.
