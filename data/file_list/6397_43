Subject: [liste-egc] 9th IEEE RCIS 2015: calls for Doctoral Consortium
 Papers, Posters & Demos session and Tutorials

Dear colleagues and friends,

Following up previous information on the RCIS 2015 conference, we would 
like to draw your attention to the following specialized events that 
will be part of the conference: the Doctoral Consortium, the Posters and 
Demos session and the Tutorials.

We are looking forward to receiving your paper and meeting you in Athens!

The RCIS 2015 Conference Committee


*DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM*
The RCIS 2015 Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral 
students to explore and develop their research interests in an 
interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of 
distinguished researchers. We invite students who feel they would 
benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply 
for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a 
similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The 
strongest candidates will be those who have a clear topic and research 
approach, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that 
they can no longer make changes. In addition to stating how you will 
gain from participation, both you and your advisor should be clear on 
what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium.

*Important dates*
Submission deadline: February 22, 2015 (23:59 Central European Time)
Author notification: March 31, 2015
Camera-ready deadline: April 15, 2015

Call for Doctoral Consortium Papers: 
http://www.rcis-conf.com/rcis2015/callDoctoral.php

*Chairs*
Maya Daneva, University of Twente, The Netherlands
Cherifa Mansoura, Senior Consultant Methodologist, Canada
Renata Guizzardi, Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo, Brasil


*POSTERS AND DEMOS*
RCIS will feature posters in a poster session and offer the opportunity 
for demonstrations of tools in a demonstration session. Both sessions 
will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to showcase their 
work, to interact with conference participants, and to obtain feedback 
on on-going research and advanced prototypes and products from 
knowledgeable conference attendees:

- Posters are intended to convey a research result and are not 
advertisements for commercial software packages. While posters need not 
describe completed work, they should report on research for which at 
least some preliminary results are available.
- Demonstrations should directly and actively involve the exhibition and 
display of software prototypes, research tools and associated materials 
that illustrate research work in progress and serve as ground for 
discussion of research ideas.

*Important dates*
Posters and Demos submission deadline: February 22, 2015 (23:59 Central 
European Time)
Author notification: March 31, 2015
Camera-ready deadline: April 15, 2015

Rim Kaabi, University of Manouba, Tunisia


*TUTORIALS*
RCIS will feature several tutorials. Tutorials are 90 minutes free 
format sessions, where the presenter(s) share(s) a specific and top of 
the art practical know-how to conference attendees that are willing to 
participate. Tutorials run in parallel with other conference tracks, and 
participation is included in the attendees’ conference fee. We invite 
proposals for tutorials that may address one or more of the listed 
topics below, although authors should not feel limited by them.

*Important dates*
Tutorial submission deadline: February 22, 2015 (23:59 Central European 
Time)
Tutorial notification: March 31, 2015

Call for Tutorials: http://www.rcis-conf.com/rcis2015/callTutorials.php
