CALL FOR PAPERS
WIMS?14
4th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics
Thessaloniki, Greece, 2-4 June 2014
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr

About WIMS?14 Conference
--------------------------
WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science conference=
s. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their state-o=
f-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine performance chara=
cteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent information techn=
ology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of Web-based i=
ntelligent information management solutions across different domains.

Objectives
----------
The purpose of the WIMS series is:
- To provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to prese=
nt their contributions to the state
    of the art research and development in Web technology and applications
- To give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research to a f=
riendly and knowledgeable
   audience and receive valuable feedback
- To provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and =
practitioners can meet

WIMS traditionally hosts a small number of short tutorials on the topics re=
lated to the scope of the conference series. The role of a WIMS tutorial is=
 to be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey. WIMS also offers its infrastr=
ucture and facilities for the organizers of satellite workshops that comple=
ment the scope of the conference. The calls for WIMS?14 Tutorials and Works=
hops are published separately.

Conference Scope
------
WIMS solicits regular and work-in-progress research, discussion papers and =
industry experience report papers in related fields. Papers exploring new d=
irections or areas are also welcome. In particular but not exclusively the =
submissions within the following major areas are relevant:

- Scalable Web and Data Architectures and Infrastructures
- Web Intelligence
- Web Mining, Information and Knowledge Extraction
- Web Semantics and Reasoning
- WIMS Applications
- Evaluation and Validation of WIMS Technologies and Applications

More details about the conference scope and topics can be found at:
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/?page_id=3D146

Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Five types of submissions are solicited for the main conference:
i.	Regular research papers (12 ACM pages)
ii.	Short research papers (6 ACM pages)
iii.	Discussion, survey, or problem analysis papers (12 ACM pages)
iv.	Posters (4 ACM pages)

More details on the nature of the different submission types can be found a=
t:
http://wims14.csd.auth.gr/?page_id=3D23

The papers in all the categories should describe original results that have=
 not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions =
will be evaluated by at least three members of the international program co=
mmittee.

Submissions should be made electronically in PDF or DOC/DOCX (MS/Open Word)=
 format via the electronic submission system of the WIMS?14 Conference Mana=
gement system at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwims14=20=20

The submissions should be typeset using the templates of the ACM Internatio=
nal Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). The templates could be retrieved =
fromhttp://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates=20=20=20=20


Publications
------------
Accepted papers/tutorials/posters will be published by ACM and disseminated=
 through the ACM Digital Library through the International Conference Proce=
edings Series (ICPS). A selection of the best WIMS'14 papers will be invite=
d to be revised and extended for the post-conference publication in the Spe=
cial Issue of the International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (I=
JAIT).
