Program :

* Samy Bengio, Senior Researcher, Google, USA
'Large Scale Image/Music Understanding'

   Image annotation is the task of providing textual semantic to new
images, by ranking a large set of possible annotations according to
how they correspond to a given image. In the large scale setting,
there could be millions of ima ges to process and hundreds of
thousands of potential distinct annotations. In order to achieve such
a task we propose to build a so-called 'embedding space', into which
both images and annotations can be automatically projected...

* Jorge Sanchez, A. Prof. Cordoba univ., Argentina
'Fisher Vectors for Large Scale Classification'

   The Fisher Vector (FV) has been introduced in classification as an
alternative to the popular Bag-of-Words (BOV) image representation. As
in the BOV, images are characterized by summary statistics computed
from a set of low-level patch descriptors extracted from the image. In
the FV framework, the sample is characterized by its deviation with
respect to a generative model of the data...We'll will first present a
formal overview of the FV framework, showing some recent results on
several small- to large-scale problems. Next, I'll discuss some
extensions to the FV which show the generality and modeling power of
the approach. Finally, I'll present some applications to other
classification re lated problems.

* Cordelia Schmid, DR INRIA, LEAR, Grenoble, France
'Actions recognition from videos: some recent results'

   The amount of digital video content available is growing daily, on
sites such as YouTube. Recent statistics on this website show that
around 48h of video are uploaded every minute. This massive data
production calls for automatic analysis. In this talk we present some
recent results for Action Recognition in Videos (ARV). Bag-of-features
have shown very good performance for ARV. We review the underlying
principles and introduce trajectory-based video features, which have
shown to outperform the state of the art...

* Barbara Caputo, Sen. Res., IDIAP EPF Lausanne, Switzerland
'Learning to learn in computer vision & robotics: some success stories
and challenges ahead'

      The awareness that learning of categories and concepts from
multimodal data should be a never ending, dynamic process, has led to
a growing interest in algorith ms for leveraging over priors over the
last years. This interest has been declined in different ways in dif
ferent communities: while the visual recognition and robotics
community have focused mostly on designing algorithms able to come
with large scale concept learning from multi modal data, machine
learning research has been developing theoretical frameworks able (to
some extent) to explain the experimental success of several of these
methods. In this lecture I will give an overview of the several
settings where learning to learn has been applied (from domain
adaptation to transfer learning)...

* Matthieu Cord, Prof. Paris VI, LIP6, France
'Beyond Bag of Visual Word model for image representation'

      I will focus on few extensions of classical
Bag-of-(Visual)-Words (BoVW) model widely used approach to represent
visual documents. BoVW relies on the quantization of local descriptors
and their aggregation into a single feature vector. The underlying
concepts, such as the visual codebook, coding, pooling, and the impact
of the main parameters of the BoVW pipeline will be discussed with few
propositions about pooling.Recently, unsupervised learning methods
have emerged to jointly learn visual codebooks and codes. I will
present approaches based on restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to
achieve this joint optimization. To enhance feature coding, RBMs may
be regularized with a sparsity constraint term. I will show
experimental results of this code learning strategy embedded in the
BoVW pipeline for image classification.

* Sebastien Paris, A. Prof. Aix Marseille univ., France
'Efficient Bag of Scenes Analysis for Image Categorization'

      We address the general problem of image/object categorization
with a novel approach referred to as Bag-of-Scenes (BoS).Our approach
is efficient for low semantic applications such as texture
classification as well as for higher semantic tasks such as natural
scenes recognition or fine-grained visual categorization . It is based
on the widely used combination of (i) Sparse coding (Sc), (ii)
Max-pooling and (iii) Spatial Pyramid Matching techniques applied to
histograms of multi-scale Local Binary/Ternary Patterns (LBP/LTP) and
its improved variants...

* Marc Le Goc, Prof. Aix Marseille univ., France
'Learning with the Theory of Timed Observations'

      We present the recent Theory of Timed Observations (TTO, Le Goc
2006), based on new mathematical object called Timed Observation. It
merges notably the results of the Bayesian Networks and Markov Chains
theories, those of the Poisson Processes theory, Shannon's theory of
communication and the logical theory of diagnosis.... We present the
main concepts and properties of TTO with didactic examples, and
real-world applications (continuous production processes, smart
environments and financial industry). Through an experimental and
conceptual benchmark, we show show that Tom4L process provides better
results than the best comparable learning algorithms.

* Peter J. Dugan, Dr, Cornell University, NY, USA,
'High performance computing for applied detection classification on
BIG-acoustic data'

      From biology to technology, the rate of data collection often
far exceeds the ability to process the information. Processing large
data sets is becoming a major point of interest for every field of
science. The ease of digital data collection allows for the capture of
many terabytes of data, yet this often creates major computational
bottlenecks when trying to analyze such datasets. This talk focuses on
a new system developed by Cor nell University that uses high
performance computing (HPC), and combines it with parallel and
distributed processing approaches to process large amounts of
bioacoustic data.
      This work will discuss how the HPC system was developed using
commercial off the shelf (COTS) tools creating a flexible
client-server model that is expandable, flexible and portable. The
presentation will demonstrate a strategy for providing a flexible
software interface for running a plurality of data mining algorithms
using a dense computer cluster called the Acoustic Data Accelerator,
or HPC-ADA. In addition, a variety of tools h ave been developed to
complement the system, providing efficient methods for data
processing... As the scale of data collection continues to expand (the
bioacoustics community will soon be faced with the challenges of
processing pedabytes of data), such high-throughput computational
approaches will be essential in bringing passive acoustic monitoring
and analysis into the realm of big data science.

* Herve Glotin, Prof. Toulon univ. & Inst. Univ. de France
'Sparse and Scattering operators for bioacoustic classification'

      After a brief introduction to the machine learning for automatic
speech recognition, we demonstrate the main difficulties for its
applications to bioacoustics. We then discuss on two efficient
approaches for scaled classification of animal sounds : the sparse
coding and the scattering operators. We illustrate their advantages
with various cases of species, from bats to whales...We will
illustrate the scaled bioacoustic paradigm with an overview of the
ICML workshop that we organize in 2013 : Bioacoustic classification
challenge at ICML 2013. This work is supported by IUF and Scaled
Acoustic Biodiversity SABIOD MASTODONS CNRS project.
