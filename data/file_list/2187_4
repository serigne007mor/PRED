CFP - UDML 3rd Workshop on Utility -Driven Mining and Learning (UDML2020)
 @ IEEE ICDM 2020
November 17 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*==== Introduction ===*
Utility-driven mining and learning from data has received emerging
attentions from KDD communities due to its high potential in wide
applications, covering finance, biomedicine, manufacturing, e-commerce,
social media, etc. Current research topics in utility-driven mining focused
primarily on discovering patterns of high value (eg, high profit) in large
databases, or analyzing/learning the important factors (eg, economic
factors) in the data mining process. One of the popular applications of
utility mining and learning is the analysis of large transactional
databases to discover high-utility itemsets, which consist of sets of items
that generate a high profit when purchased together.

The workshop aims at bringing together academic and industrial researchers
and practitioners from data mining, machine learning and other
interdisciplinary communities, in the collaborative effort of identifying
and discussing major technical challenges, recent results and potential
topics on the emerging fields of Utility-Driven Mining and Learning. This
workshop will focus on real world experiences, inherent challenges, as well
as new research methods/applications desired.

* ==== Topics of interest ===  *
Theory and core methods for utility mining and learning
Utility patterns mining in large datasets, e.g., high-utility itemset
mining, high-utility sequential patterns/rules mining, high-utility episode
mining, and other novel patterns
Analysis and learning of novel utility factors in mining and learning
process
Predictive modeling/learning, clustering and link analysis that incorporate
utility factors
Incremental utility mining and learning
Utility mining and learning in streams
Utility mining and learning in uncertain systems
Utility mining and learning in big data
Knowledge representations for utility patterns
Privacy preserving utility mining/learning
Visualization techniques for utility mining/learning
Open-source software/libraries/platform
Innovative applications in interdisciplinary domains, like finance,
biomedicine, healthcare, manufacturing, e-commerce, social media,
education, etc.
New, open, or unsolved problems in utility-driven mining
The workshop will be held on November 17, 2020 in Sorrento (Italy) at the
IEEE ICDM 2020 conference.


*==== Important dates === *Paper submission deadline: August 24, 2020
Paper notifications: September 17, 2020
Camera-ready deadline and copyright forms:
September 24, 2020

* ====  Submission information ===*
Submissions are limited to 10 pages, and must be formatted according to the
IEEE 2-column format (link)

Papers will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria of the main IEEE
ICDM 2020 conference for research papers.

All accepted papers will be published in the IEEE ICDM 2020 Workshop
proceedings.

For any questions, please contact the organizing committee.
