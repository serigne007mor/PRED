                     2nd International Workshop on
               Information Management in Mobile Applications
                 http://www.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/IMMoA2012

          in conjunction with VLDB 2012 (http://www.vldb2012.org)
                           Istanbul, Turkey
                            August 31, 2012

                         -- Call for Papers --

**** Deadline Extended until June 18, 2012!  ******

**** Best Papers will be invited to Special Issue  *****
****  in Pervasive and Mobile Computing (Elsevier Journal) *****

Mobile devices pose tremendous challenges to the design and implementation of
information systems suited for mobile environments. While users expect similar
functionality on their smartphone as provided on their laptop or desktop
computer, the hardware and communication platforms are still limited.
Especially, data-intensive mobile applications require new ways of data
management, processing, and analysis. Crucial issues include energy-efficiency,
limited CPU power and storage, real-time processing, small displays, and
communication costs.

The rapid development in mobile hardware and software has enabled new
applications which pose new challenges for mobile data management. Improvements
in the area of mobile communication and increased bandwidth provides new
possibilities for exchanging and sharing data. Mobile data can have various
forms, such as sensor data, user profiles&   user context, spatial data, and
multimedia data. Smartphones, mobile and wearable sensors, and other portable
systems are used in various applications to collect, process, and exchange an
increasing amount of data. Applications can run on several devices (mobile, PCs,
multimedia), but the exchange, the integration, and the querying of data between
these devices remains a challenging problem. This workshop aims at providing a
discussion forum for recent research in this area.

The first edition of the workshop HIMoA 2011 (International Workshop on Managing
Health Information in Mobile Applications, http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/HIMoA2011)
focused on data management for mobile applications in health related settings.
The International Workshop on Information Management for Mobile Applications
(IMMoA'12) can be seen as a continuation of the successful HIMoA workshop and
aims at a broader range of mobile applications and systems. IMMoA'12 targets to
provide a forum for discussion about technologies and mechanisms, which support
the management of mobile, complex, integrated, distributed, and heterogeneous
data-focused applications. The workshop is held in conjunction with VLDB 2012
(http://www.vldb2012.org) as the workshop addresses important subareas in data
management.

The list of topics includes, but is not limited to:
  * Data management and integration in mobile peer-to-peer networks
  * Data stream management in mobile applications/environments
  * Data stream mining for mobile applications
  * Mobile Cloud Computing
  * Data integration in mobile settings
  * Context-aware mobile computing
  * Applications using mobile data management techniques
  * Query processing and optimization for mobile systems
  * Real-time data processing in mobile applications
  * Security and privacy for mobile data management
  * Pervasive data management
  * Transaction processing in mobile applications
  * Expert systems for mobile information systems
  * Sensing and acquisition of data in mobile environments
  * Data sharing and interoperability in mobile applications
  * Managing data intensive mobile applications
  * Management and processing of geospatial data
  * Mobile health data management and analysis
  * Pervasive health systems and services
  * Location-based services
  * Mobile data management systems and middleware
  * Knowledge representation and reasoning in mobile applications

***** Submission Guidelines *****

The page limits for accepted regular workshop papers are 8 pages, including all figures,
tables, and references, and 4 pages max for short papers. Papers must be in VLDB format.
Templates can be found at http://vldb2012.org/call-for-contributions/preparation-and-formatting-guidelines/

Submissions in PDF are to be uploaded to the workshop's submission site
http://www.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/IMMoA2012/submission.shtml

All submissions must be unique and not have been published already in another context.



***** Workshop Proceedings *****

The proceedings of the workshop will be published online as a volume of the CEUR
Workshop Proceedings, ISSN 1613-0073, http://www.ceur-ws.org, a well-known
website for publishing workshop proceedings. It is indexed by the major
publication portals, such as Citeseer, DBLP, and Google Scholar.

Furthermore, we plan a special issue in a journal on mobile information systems
for which the authors of the best papers of the workshop will be invited to
submit an extended version of their work.
