The 6th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and=20
Semantics (WIMS'16) will be hosted by the LGI2P Research Center of=20
"Ecole des mines d'Al=C3=A8s" (EMA), in the antique city of N=C3=AEmes in=
 south of=20
France. Its organizing committee invites proposals for Workshops,=20
Demonstrations (on new applications) and Tutorials to be held in=20
conjunction with the conference. The overall purpose of workshops and=20
tutorials is to provide participants with the opportunity to present and =

discuss novel research ideas in areas of Web intelligence, Web mining=20
and Web semantics, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental=20
interaction between these vibrant fields of research and development.=20
The purpose of demonstrations is to provide developers with a place to=20
showcase new practical and innovative implementations of=20
state-of-the-art systems in the areas of interest to the Web=20
Intelligence and Semantics community.

Workshops and tutorials provide a forum for an intensive and focused=20
scientific exchange amongst researchers and practitioners interested in=20
a particular topic and a meeting venue for the community. Organizers may =

structure workshops/tutorials as they see fit, possibly including=20
invited talks, panel discussions, presentations of work in progress,=20
peer-reviewed papers, demonstrations or some combination. A=20
workshop/tutorial could be scheduled for a half a day or a full day,=20
depending on potential interest and organizers preference.

Workshops and tutorials should address topics that satisfy the following =

criteria:
- The topic falls in the general scope of WIMS 2016 (see the Call for=20
Research Papers)
- There is a clear focus on a specific theme, technology, problem, or=20
application
- There is a sufficiently large audience interested in the topic

The organizers of successful workshops and tutorials will be responsible =

for their own reviewing process, website, arranging invited speakers and =

co-ordinate the collection and delivery of camera ready material. There=20
is an opportunity for papers accepted in workshops to be published in=20
the WIMS`15 proceedings and disseminated through the ACM Digital=20
Library, provided they follow the ACM submission guidelines and template =

and adhere to camera ready submission and registration deadlines as=20
those set for the main conference. Selected extended papers will be=20
invited to appear in a special issue of a reputed journal in the field.
Please note that the submission format is MS Word or PDF. The papers=20
must be written in English and formatted according to the ACM SIG=20
Proceedings Templates
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates).
