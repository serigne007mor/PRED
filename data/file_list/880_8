Call for contributions to One-day Workshop,

  "Statistical approaches and validation in clustering:
   Mixture models and nonparametric methods."


** Location and date: Lisieux, France, June Friday 29, 2007
Conference web-site http://www.iutcaen.unicaen.fr/stid/colloque/main.html


** Topics and aims

Cluster analysis is an important part of Data Mining and MachineLearning.
Several problems are difficult to be solved as the determination of the num=
ber
of clusters, the selection of the relevant variables, and the stability and
relevance of the clusters. The purpose of this one-day workshop is to addre=
ss
these topics, from a theoretical point of view. Mixture Models of parametric
probability distributions provide a statistically mature approach to answer
such questions. But, there is a recent interest for making use of nonparame=
tric
stability-based methods to evaluate the clusters, and to help in the choice=
 of
the parameters of a clustering algorithm. The workshop is aiming to present
those two different approaches and discuss their connections.


** Invited speakers

Patrice Bertrand (ENST Bretagne, France),
Gilles Celeux * (INRIA futurs, France),
