== Posters and Demos Track ==
The Posters and Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in 
progress, late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller
contributions in all fields related to the Semantic Web and Linked Data 
in a broader sense. These include submissions on innovative applications
with impact on end users, such as demos of solutions that users may test 
or that are yet in the conceptual phase but are worth discussing, and
also applications or pieces of code that may attract developers and 
potential research or business partners.

= Important Dates:
* Paper Submission Deadline:                June 22, 2020 (11:59 pm, 
Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance:                 July 22, 2020 (11:59 pm, 
Hawaii time)
* Camera-Ready Paper:                             August 01, 2020 (11:59 
pm, Hawaii time)

Author instructions: Proceedings are planned to be published via CEUR 
Workshop Proceedings and should follow the guidelines of the Springer
LNCS format.  The detailed Call for Poster and Demos papers is available 
online.

== Industry and Use Case Track ==
Focusing strongly on industry needs and ground breaking technology 
trends SEMANTICS invites presentations on enterprise solutions that deal
with semantic processing of data and/or information. A special focus of 
Semantics 2019 will be on the convergence of machine learning techniques
and knowledge graphs. Additional topics of interest are Enterprise 
Knowledge Graphs, Semantic AI & Machine Learning, Enterprise Data
Integration, Linked Data & Data Publishing, Semantic Search, 
Recommendation Services, Thesaurus and/or Ontology Management, Text
Mining, Data Mining and any related fields. All submissions should have 
a strong focus on real-world applications beyond the prototypical stage
and demonstrate the power of semantic systems!

== Workshops and Tutorials ==
Workshops and Tutorials at SEMANTiCS 2018 allow your organisation or 
project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased
visibility. The workshops and tutorials will provide a forum for 
presenting widely recognised contributions and findings to a diverse and
knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a 
dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a
closed format for research and commercial project consortia meetings.

= Important Dates for Workshops:
* Proposals  WS Deadline:                March 23, 2020 (11:59 pm, 
Hawaii time)
* Notification of Acceptance:                 April 20, 2020 (11:59 pm, 
Hawaii time)

== Special Calls ==
Special calls or sub-topics are dedicated towards specific topics that 
are of special interest to the SEMANTiCS community. IN case we receive a
sufficient amount of high quality submissions these topics will become 
special tracks within the conference program. For 2020 SEMANTiCS
Amsterdam encourages submissions to the following sub-topics:

* Special Sub-Topic: Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage
* Special Sub-Topic: LegalTech
* Special Sub-Topic: Blockchain and Semantics

Each sub-topic is managed by a distinct committee and encourages 
submissions from the scientific or industrial domain. Scientific
submissions will undergo a thorough review process and will be published 
in the conference proceedings in case of acceptance. Industrial
submissions will be evaluated and selected according to the quality 
criteria of the industry track. WE are looking forward to your submissions!

== About SEMANTiCS ==
The annual SEMANTiCS EU conference is the meeting place for 
professionals who make semantic computing work, understand its benefits,
and encounter its limitations. Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts 
researchers and practitioners alike from a wide spectrum of
organisations ranging from universities, non-profit organisations, 
public administration bodies, to SMEs and the largest companies in the
world.
SEMANTiCS 2020 is bound to continue a long tradition of building bridges 
between like minded but often separated communities of interest. To do
so, the conference aims to explore the intersections, benefits and 
hurdles of various traditions in artificial intelligence, machine 
learning and
semantic processing of graph data and information. SEMANTiCS 2020 
invites latest scientific research as well as presentations on industry
implementations, use case prototypes and best practices.

The SEMANTiCS program will provide a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions on emerging topics and presentations of practical systems by
people who make things work - just like you. In addition, attendees will 
have a unique opportunity to network with experts in a variety of
fields. These relationships provide great value to organisations as they 
encounter technical challenges in any stage of implementation. The
expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their 
careers and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS the key event
across Europe for a diverse community of industry leaders and academic 
experts alike.
