TECHNICOLOR Research and Innovation --  located in RENNES, France -- 
Internship position -- 2015

Internship position on language-based social network analysis

----------------

In social network analysis, the analysis and detection of user roles 
(celebrities, trolls, flamers, etc.) allow to understand, and sometimes 
to predict, the dynamics of the community. The goal of this internship 
is to make a new contribution in the analysis of online roles by 
analyzing the language, linguistic style and communication strategies 
used by each role.

Skills: Data Mining, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing 
(NLP), Python, R.

Student profile: Master 2

Desired starting month: Feb-April 2015

Duration: 6 months

Location: Cesson-Sévigné (Rennes, France)

Context

----------------

For more info on Technicolor Research & Innovation, Rennes: 
https://research.technicolor.com/rennes/

The internship will be hosted at Technicolor R&I in Rennes, France (500 
employees, of which 130 researchers) within the Data Processing Lab. In 
our team we deliver technologies to capture, manage and analyze data 
coming from heterogeneous (including mobile & home) environments.

We are currently exploring new algorithms and statistical models to 
analyze the interactions between users in online forums. Our aim is to 
automatically discover the social roles that users play in discussions: 
celebrities, experts, novices, flamers or trolls are some of the 
possible roles that one may find in online communities. Some interesting 
questions that are yet to be answered are how each user may influence 
the discussion, how interactions between users who belong to different 
roles can shape the forums, and who is able to foster the activity of 
other users in an online conversation.

Objective

----------------

The intern will develop a new algorithm for language-based clustering of 
users adapted to discussion forums.  The algorithm will have to be 
integrated to state-of-the-art role-detection algorithms developed at 
Technicolor. It will be benchmarked against other types of user 
clustering and more specifically tested in terms of:

a) appealing and informative output that allow administrators to get a 
rapid overview of what kind of users participate in the discussions and how.

b) predictive power on users behavior.

Task description

----------------

First, the intern will familiarize himself/herself with the state-of-art 
techniques on role detection and on language analysis especially in the 
context of online forums.

In a second phase, the intern will implement and apply existing role 
detection algorithms to several corpora of online discussion threads to 
set up a baseline and get acquainted with available datasets.

Then, he/she will propose and implement clustering algorithms to detect 
types of users (roles) based on their use of language (vocabulary, 
conversation strategies, style, etc.).

Finally, the intern will integrate the algorithm with the ones that have 
already been developed in-house.

A scientific publication will be possible in case of satisfactory results.

If interested, please apply at stage.rennes@technicolor.com 
<mailto:stage.rennes@technicolor.com> by sending us your resume and a 
cover letter with the internship reference DPL_2015_DM_046 in the email 
subject line.
