PostDoc position in semantic web

Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, CEDRIC Laboratory, Paris, France

Context
This postdoctoral position takes place within the EU H2020 SAFECARE 
project (SAFEguard of Critical heAlth infrastructure). The aim of this 
project is to provide solutions that will improve both physical and 
cyber security in cost-effective way. Also, it will promote new 
technologies and novel approaches to enhance threat prevention, threat 
detection, incident response and mitigation of impacts.
Nowadays, the lines between physical and cyber worlds are increasingly 
blurred. Almost all equipment is connected to the Internet, and physical 
intrusion might affect cyber security. Threats cannot be analyzed 
separately as physical or cyber, and therefore it is critical to develop 
an integrated approach in order to fight against such combination of 
threats.
One of the main objectives of SAFECARE is to propose a model that 
formalizes the cascading effect of an incident in the context of 
e-heath. Based on this model, it will be possible to anticipate the 
potential impacts of cyber and physical incidents, not only on building 
infrastructures (power supply, air cooling, etc.), but also on IT 
systems and medical devices. The model will be based on an ontology that 
describes the domain knowledge.

The position responsibilities include:
- Investigating existing ontologies that contribute to the definition of 
the threat propagation model.
- Studying the different threat propagation models.
- Operationalizing the ontology and implementing the propagation model.

Requirements
The ideal candidate holds a doctoral degree in Computer science or a 
related field and is able to combine theoretical and practical aspects 
in his/her work. Fluent English communication and software technology 
skills are fundamental requirements. The candidate should have a 
background in at least one of the following fields:
- Semantic web technologies
- Knowledge representation
- Logic, AI, automated reasoning, or related subfields

It would be a plus if the candidate has a background in cyber security 
field.

Full-stack developing skills are required.

Duration:
one year, renewable for a second year, starting as soon as possible.

Location:
Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, CEDRIC Laboratory, 2 rue
