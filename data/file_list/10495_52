(apologies for multiple postings)

The Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics workshop at 
ECML/PKDD 2013 solicits papers on Machine Learning, Data Mining, and 
other related approaches for sports analytics. The application of 
analytic techniques is rapidly gaining traction in both professional and 
amateur sports circles. The majority of techniques used in the field so 
far are statistical. While there has been some interest in the Machine 
Learning and Data Mining community, it has been somewhat muted so far. 
The goal of this workshop is two-fold. The first is to raise awareness 
about this emerging application area. The second is to bring members of 
the sport analytics community into contact with typical ECML/PKDD 
contributors, and to highlight what the community has done and can do in 
the field.

To this end, we invite submissions on all topics related to the 
automated analysis of sports data. Possible topics include:

- Player acquisition and team spending
- Training regimens and focus
- Match strategy
- Injury prediction and prevention
- Predicting match outcomes
- Betting odds calculation
- Text analysis of match reports
- Descriptive modeling
We are open to all sports, including, but not limited to, 
football/soccer, basketball, baseball, American football, etc. Papers 
can report on empirical findings, novel metrics, new problems, novel 
algorithms, etc.

Authors can submit long papers or extended abstracts. Long papers should 
report on novel, unpublished work that might not be quite mature enough 
for a conference or journal submission. Papers can be a maximum of 8 
pages excluding references. Extended abstracts can be a maximum of 2 
pages including references and should summarize recent publications that 
fit the theme of the workshop. Authors should submit a PDF version in 
Springer LNCS style via easychair: 
https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=mlsa13

Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program 
Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, 
and clarity. Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper 
is accepted, at least one author should attend the workshop to present 
the paper.

Key Dates
Submission deadline: Friday July 5, 2013
Notification date: Friday July 19, 2013
Camera-ready deadline: Friday August 2, 2013
Workshop date: Friday September 27, 2013
