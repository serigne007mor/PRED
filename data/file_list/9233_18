Subject: [liste-egc] WETICE'2013: First Call for Papers

                 22nd WETICE Conference: WETICE-2013
			   Hammamet, Tunisia
			   June 17-20, 2012

			http://wetice2013.redcad.org
		             Call for Papers

WETICE is an annual IEEE co-sponsored International Conference on
Collaboration Technologies and Infrastructure with its Proceedings
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. WETICE'2013 will consist
of a number of conference tracks on various topics related to
collaboration technology.

WETICE conference promotes fruitful discussions on the latest
technology developments, directions, problems, and requirements. Each
conference track will include paper presentations and group
discussions. In addition, there will be keynote sessions and a final
joint session to summarize each groups findings.

Important Dates

- Submission of papers to all tracks	February 1, 2013
- Notification to authors	 	March 15, 2013
- WETICE-2013 Conference	 	June 17-20, 2013

What sets WETICE apart from larger conferences is that the conference
tracks are kept small enough to promote fruitful discussions on the
latest technology developments, directions, problems, and
requirements. Each track includes paper presentations and group
discussions while the keynote sessions and summary of discussions take
place in joint sessions. WETICE welcomes papers on "work-in-progress"
from the Ph.D. students.

Several special issues of index journals are programed. The final list
will be annonced later.
