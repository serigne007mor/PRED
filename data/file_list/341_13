    *First Call for Papers - ECIR 2009*

    31st European Conference on Information Retrieval - Toulouse –
    France, 6-9 April 2009
    In cooperation with: BCS-IRSG, ACM SIGIR, ARIA
    http://ecir09.irit.fr

The annual European Conference on Information Retrieval is the main
European forum for the presentation of new research results in the field
of Information Retrieval. The conference encourages the submission of
high quality research papers reporting original, previously unpublished
results.


  Call for papers

The European Conference on Information Retrieval provides an opportunity
for both new and established researchers to present research papers
reporting new, unpublished, and innovative research results within
information retrieval. Poster submissions addressing any of the areas
identified in the conference topics are also invited. Authors are
encouraged to demonstrate work in progress and late-breaking research
results.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:
- IR Theory and Formal Models
- Performance, Scalability, Architectures, Efficiency, Platforms
- Indexing. Query representation, Query reformulation, Structure-based
representation, XML, Metadata, Social tagging. Summarization. Natural
language processing for IR.
- Evaluation methods and metrics, Experimental design, Test collection
- Interactive IR, User interfaces and visualization, User studies, User
models, Task-based IR, User/Task-based IR theory
- Web IR, Digital libraries. Intranet, Desktop, Enterprise and Blog
Search. Adversarial IR
- Distributed IR, Fusion/Combination. Mobile IR
- Cross-language retrieval, Multilingual retrieval, Machine translation
for IR
- Multimedia IR
- Topic detection and tracking, Routing, Content-based filtering,
Collaborative filtering, Agents, Spam filtering
- Question answering, Information extraction, Summarization, Lexical
acquisition
- Text Data Mining
- Text Categorization, Clustering
- Other domain-specific IR (e.g., Genomic IR, legal IR, IR for chemical
structures)
- Blog and online-community search

Submissions must be written in English following the LNCS guidelines and
must not exceed 12 pages including references and figures. All papers
and posters will be refereed through blind peer review. Accepted papers
and poster abstracts will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at
the Conference.

Queries regarding full paper submission should be directed to the
programme Chair: Mohand Boughanem (bougha@irit.fr).


Call for posters

Poster presentations offer researchers a unique opportunity to present
late-breaking results, significant work in progress or research that is
best communicated in an interactive or graphical format, for which there
is more time for discussion and questions than is sometimes available in
a full paper session. Poster presentations are also a good way to
present work applying information retrieval approaches and techniques to
new domains and problems. Please note, however, that posters describing
work at the proposal stage cannot be accepted. Poster submissions are
welcomed in any of the areas identified in the call for papers.

Submissions in this category should be formatted as per the instructions
for full papers (above), the maximum length of poster papers is 5 pages
including figures and references. Accepted posters papers will be
presented at a dedicated session.

Queries regarding poster submission should be directed to catherine
Berrut (catherine.berrut@imag.fr).


Call for Workshops and tutorials **

Proposals are solicited for one-day workshops and tutorials the first
day of the conference. The purpose of ECIR workshops is to provide a
platform for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly more
focused way than the conference itself. As such, they also offer a good
opportunity for young researchers to present their work and to obtain
feedback from an interested community. Tutorials inform the Information
Retrieval community on recent advancements in related fields, or on
novel application areas related to Information Retrieval.

Submissions describing proposed workshops and tutorials should be up to
1,000 words in PDF format. They should state the title and the goals of
the proposed workshop or tutorial, as well as the full contact details
of the organizers and presenters, including a one-paragraph biography
with past experience in organizing relevant events.

The submitted proposals should include a short summary and justification
of the proposed topic, explaining its relevance to Information Retrieval
and to the audience of ECIR. Furthermore, proposals should include a
description of the format of the proposed workshop or tutorial (e.g.,
the structure of tutorials, or the type of accepted contributions,
discussion groups, and panels for workshops). The proposals should
provide the expected number of participants, potential invited speakers,
a description of the process of selecting contributions and
participants, a tentative or confirmed program committee (if a program
committee is formed), as well as the planned outcomes of the proposed
workshop or tutorial (e.g., proceedings or special issue in a journal
for workshops, or course material for tutorials).

The submitted proposals will undergo peer review and decisions will be
made by an international program committee.
Queries regarding workshop and tutorials submissions should be directed
to Josiane Mothe (mothe@irit.fr)

An award will be presented to the author of the Best Paper, Best Student
Paper, and Best Poster presented at the conference.
