ECAI 2012 -- Call For Papers
www2.lirmm.fr/ecai2012

ECAI is the biennial European Conference on Artificial Intelligence
organised by the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial
Intelligence (ECCAI); it is the premier forum for presenting Artificial
Intelligence results in Europe. The twentieth conference in this series,
ECAI 2012, will take place in Montpellier (France), August 27-31.

ECAI 2012 will gather researchers and practitioners of Artificial
Intelligence from all over the world; they will present the latest
results and identify new trends and challenges in all subfields of
Artificial Intelligence as well as demonstrate innovative applications
and uses of advanced Artificial Intelligence technology. In addition to
the main technical track, the ECAI 2012 program will feature keynote and
invited talks, invited tutorials, an elaborate workshop program, a
system-demonstration track and a Turing centenary celebration, in which
we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Alan Turing and
his influence on Artificial Intelligence. ECAI 2012 will also feature
the 6th STAIRS (STarting AI Researcher Symposium) and the 6th PAIS
(Conference on Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems) as
sub-conferences.

ECAI 2012 welcomes submissions of technical papers to the main track.
Submitted papers should present original, high-quality and previously
unpublished results on all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. ECAI 2012
especially encourages submissions that cross discipline boundaries
within Artificial Intelligence, and between Artificial Intelligence and
other disciplines. Both long (6-page) and short (2-page) papers can be
submitted. Whereas long papers should report on substantial research
results, short papers are intended for highly promising but possibly
more preliminary work. Short papers will be presented in poster form.
Rejected long papers will not be considered for the short paper track.

ECAI 2012 also welcomes submission of proposals for workshops,
descriptions of system-demo's, papers on prestigious applications of AI
for PAIS, and contributions of starting researchers in AI for STAIRS;
cf. the separate calls for these tracks.
