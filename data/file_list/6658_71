coordination of
the processing sectors.


The successful applicant will have to provide multicriteria decision 
support using multiple and/or heterogeneous data sources.
He/she will have to model the points of view of the stakeholders who 
impact the decision making in order to propose consensual actions.

engineering and decision-making. Postdoctoral work experience, 
preferably abroad, would be appreciated.
Technical skills for implementation and, if possible, software 
development supervision would be greatly appreciated.
Experience in software development including prototyping would be an 
asset. An experience of collaboration with researchers from other 
disciplines would be highly desirable.
Candidates should have a good command of English.

Applications will be accepted until 3 March 2014.
The starting date will be September-October 2014.
