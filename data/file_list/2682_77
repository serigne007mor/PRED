CALL FOR PAPER
13th International ACM Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems =
(MEDES'2021)
In-cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
http://medes.sigappfr.org/21/ <http://medes.sigappfr.org/21/>
November 1-3, 2021
Hammamet, Tunisia

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and =
exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of =
intelligent environments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the =
Web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as =
individuals, organisations, services, software, and applications sharing =
one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and =
inter-relationships among them. With the help of the computational =
intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties =
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration), thanks =
to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", in =
which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed =
and used. The underlying Web-based resources mainly comprehend big data =
management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms. =
Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are =
highly complex to study, design, and develop. This also leads to a poor =
understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital =
ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The =
application of Information and Communication Technologies has the =
potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resources =
and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting =
business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved =
through novel techniques, models, and methods for fields such as big =
data management, Web technologies, networking, security, human-computer =
interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organising =
systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage =
their resources.

The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) =
aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia, =
research laboratories, and industries interested in exploring the =
manifold challenges and issues related to resource management of Digital =
Ecosystems and how current approaches, techniques, and technologies can =
be evolved and adapted to this end. MEDES=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A22021 =
calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results or novel =
ideas in all areas of Digital EcoSystems. At the same time, the =
conference calls for short papers presenting interesting and exciting =
recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not quite =
ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.

PAPER SUBMISSION
Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be =
uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at =
most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with =
length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at =
least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary notification date, authors =
rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiries and their =
comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with =
the final decision. Selection criteria will include relevance, =
significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of =
presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong =
or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital =
Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present =
the paper. The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and =
indexed by the ACM Digital Library and DBLP. Kindly submit your papers =
