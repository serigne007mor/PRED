Aim and Scope

Modeling and analyzing networks is a major emerging topic in different rese=
arch
areas, such as computational biology, social science, document retrieval, e=
tc.
Nowadays, the scientific communities have access to huge volumes of network-
structured data, such as social networks, gene/proteins/metabolic networks,
sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks. Most often, these data are not only
static, but they are collected at different time points. This dynamic view =
of
the system allows the time component to play a key role in the comprehensio=
n of
the evolutionary behavior of the network.

Handling such data is a major challenge for current research in machine
learning and data mining, and it has led to the development of recent
innovative techniques that consider complex/multi-level networks, time-evol=
ving
graphs, heterogeneous information (nodes and links), and requires scalable
algorithms that are able to manage huge and complex networks.

DyNaK workshop is motivated by the interest of providing a meeting point for
scientists with different backgrounds that are interested in the study of l=
arge
complex networks and the dynamic aspects of such networks. It aims at
attracting contributions from both aspects of networks analysis: large real
network analysis and modeling, and knowledge discovery within those network=
s.

Paper Submission

We welcome original contributions, either theoretical or empirical, describ=
ing=20
ongoing projects or completed work (even partially published). The instruct=
ions
for authors and the LaTeX packages can be found at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
