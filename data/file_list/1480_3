Call for Tutorials

The SIAM Data Mining (SDM10) Organizing Committee invites proposals for 
tutorials
to be held in conjunction with the conference. Tutorials are an 
effective way to
educate and/or provide the necessary background to the intended audience 
enabling
them to understand technical advances.

For SDM10, we are seeking proposals for tutorials on all topics related 
to data mining. A
tutorial may be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey, discuss novel 
data mining
techniques or may center around on successful and timely application of 
data mining in
important application areas (e.g. medicine, national security, computer 
security,
social networks, bioinformatics, scientific data analysis).  For 
examples of typical
SIAM tutorials, see the set of accepted tutorials at previous
SIAM conference http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm09/tutorials.php.

Tutorials are open to all conference attendees without any extra fees.
A typical tutorial will be 2 hrs long (longer tutorials can be considered).
Previous SDM conferences attracted up to 100 attendees in a tutorial.

Proposals should be submitted electronically by October 9, 2009 to:

Jennifer G. Dy
Associate Professor
Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Northeastern University, Boston, MA
jdy@ece.neu.edu

Proposals should be submitted in PDF format (for other formats please 
contact the tutorial chair first).  
Proposals should include the following:
    
1. Basic Information: Title, brief description, name and contact 
information for
each tutor, length of the proposed tutorial. If the intended tutorial is 
expected to
take longer than 2 hours, a rationale is expected. Also identify any 
other venues in
which the tutorial has been or will be presented.

2. Intended Audience: Proposals must clearly identify the intended 
audience for the
tutorial (e.g., novice, intermediate, expert).
    What background will be required of the audience?
    Why is this topic important/interesting to the SIAM data mining 
community?
    What is the benefit to participants?
    Provide some informal evidence that people would attend (e.g., 
related workshops).

3. Coverage: Enough material should be included to provide a sense of 
both the scope of
material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered. The 
more details that
can be provided, the better (up to and including links to the actual 
slides or viewgraphs).
Note that the tutors should not focus mainly on their own research 
results. If, for
certain parts of the tutorial, the material comes directly from the 
tutors' own
research or product, please indicate this clearly in the proposal.

4. Biographies: Provide brief biographical information on each tutor 
(including qualifications
with respect to the tutorial's topic).
Special equipment (if any): Please indicate any additional equipment 
needed (if any).
The standard equipment includes an LCD projector and single projection 
screen.

Important Dates:
    Submission : October 9, 2009
    Decision Notification : November 6, 2009
    Complete Set of Tutorial Viewgraphs (Slides): February 19, 2010
