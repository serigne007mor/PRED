Dear Colleagues,

Please find below a call for papers for the Special Issue "Edge-Based AI
for the Internet of Things". This special issue belongs to Sensors Journal
(ISSN 1424-8220, IF 3.031) and it is related to the section "Sensor
Networks".

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Edge_Based_AI_IoT

Deadline for manuscript submissions: 15 October 2020

The Internet of Things paradigm enables various smart objects to be
connected to the Internet. This, in turn, enables smart applications that
allow us to interact with our environment in an intelligent way. However,
in order to achieve the full potential of IoT applications, we need AI
techniques to analyze the data produced by IoT objects. AI techniques are
needed to analyze the data in order to extract insights and actionable
knowledge.

The use of AI approaches to analyze IoT data faces several challenges due
to data heterogeneity and limited resources of most IoT objects. On the one
hand, the data cannot be processed in the objects and on the other hand
processing data using AI techniques in the cloud incurs a substantial
amount of latency. Thus, edge-based AI techniques are required that can
process the data on the edge near the applications and objects. The idea is
that edge AI infrastructure will process the data in order to minimize the
delay and will cooperate with the central cloud for the processing that
cannot be done on the edge.

This Special Issue targets AI techniques and data processing applied to the
Internet of Things. The focus will be on edge AI techniques applied to IoT
data and applications. This will enable the distribution of the
intelligence of IoT applications across the cloud and the edge.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

    Edge AI for IoT
    Distributed data processing for IoT
    Distributed reasoning for IoT
    Edge AI architecture
    Distributed AI algorithms
    Distributed ML for IoT
    Federated learning for IoT
    Reinforcement learning for IoT
    Edge machine learning for energy efficiency in IoT
    Edge AI vs cloud AI for IoT

Special issue editors:

Dr. Kamal Singh
Dr. Abbas Bradai
Dr. Yassine Hadjadj-Aoul
