Call For Papers

*The 12th International ACM Conference on Management of Digital 
EcoSystems (MEDES'20) **
**In-Cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6**
**http://medes.sigappfr.org/20/**
**November 2nd - 4th, 2020**
**Abu Dhabi, UAE *



*Description and Objectives*

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and 
exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of 
intelligent environments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the 
web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as 
individuals, organisations, services, software and applications sharing 
one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and 
inter-relationships among them. With the help of the computational 
intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties 
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) 
environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital 
components", in which resources provided by each entity are properly 
conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly 
comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* 
properties platforms. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital 
ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads 
to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower 
digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The 
application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the 
understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact 
to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and 
knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, 
models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web 
technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, 
artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organising systems to 
support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their 
resources. The International Conference on Management of Digital 
EcoSystems (MEDES),previously named "The International Conference on 
Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems", aims to develop and bring 
together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and 
industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues 
related to resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current 
approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end. 
MEDES 2018 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results 
or novel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems. At the same 
time, the conference calls for short papers presenting interesting and 
exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not 
quite ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.


*Topics*

MEDES seeks contributions in the following areas:

Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
Data & Knowledge Management
Computational and Collective Intelligence
Semantic Computing
Software ecosystems for software engineering
Big Data
Services
Trust, Security & Privacy
Software Engineering
Internet of Things and Intelligent Web
Cyber Physical Systems
Social and Collaborative Platforms
Human-Computer Interaction
Open Source
Applications (Logistics, Energy, Healthcare, Environment, Smart Cities, 
Digital Humanities, Robotics, etc.)
Complex Systems and Networks

*Paper Submission*

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be 
uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at 
most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with 
length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at 
least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary notification date, authors 
rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiries and their 
comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with 
the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, 
significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of 
presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong 
or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital 
Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present 
the paper. The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and 
indexed by the ACM Digital Library and DBLP. Kindly submit your papers 
by clicking https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=medes2020.


*Poster Submission*

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to present 
early-stage or ongoing research, and to receive valuable feedback from 
conference attendees. We also strongly encourage student and industry 
submissions. Topics of interest are the same as those listed in the main 
conference and special session call for papers. A Best Poster Award will 
be assigned by an independent review committee according to the quality 
of research work and the quality of poster presentation. Authors are 
required to submit a short paper describing the poster content. 
Specifically, this paper should clearly state: (a) the research problem 
being addressed including the current state of the art, (b) what makes 
this problem relevant, important, and challenging, (c) the approach to 
the problem, (d) the key contribution, and (e) the expected results. 
Submitted papers must present original unpublished research that is not 
currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts 
should be prepared in 10-point font using the 2-column ACM conference 
format https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template and may not 
exceed 2 pages, including figures tables (references may extend beyond 
this limit up to 1 more page). All papers should be written in English 
and submitted electronically in PDF format via the submission site 
posted on this page. Notice that authors do not submit the poster, but 
only the short paper describing in text what the poster would present. 
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by a technical program committee and 
will be judged based on their novelty, relevance, technical strength as 
well as the potential to generate discussions. Papers not following 
these guidelines may be rejected without review. Also, submissions 
received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not 
appropriately structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact 
the program chairs for further information or clarification. Papers 
should be submitted electronically by the deadline to 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=medes2020. All accepted papers 
will appear in the conference proceedings. At least one of the authors 
of every accepted poster must register at the conference and present the 
poster at the poster session. The recommended poster size is A0 (33.1 x 
46.8 in, portrait orientation). The conference does not provide any 
support for printing posters. Typically, authors print their posters 
ahead of the conference.

*Special Issue*

Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their 
work to appear in the Internet of Things Journal.

*Important Dates*

Submission Deadline: June 15th, 2020
Notification of Acceptance: July 27th, 2020
Camera Ready: August 10th, 2020
Paper Registration: August 10th, 2020
