#####################################################################

The 2011 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conferences on WEB INTELLIGENCE 
and INTELLIGENT AGENT TECHNOLOGY
22 - 27 August 2011, Campus Scientifique de la Doua, Lyon, France
http://wi-iat-2011.org <http://wi-iat-2011.org/>


The 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and 
Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT'11)
is a premier event for the Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent 
community. The field continues to experience
rapid growth both in academia and industry. The industry day of the 
conference aims to bring together people from
both academia and industry in a venue that highlights application and 
practical impact.
We invite the submission of industry papers. The papers will be included 
in the main conference proceedings. The
paper speakers will be invited to participate in a panel. All 
participants of the conference are invited to
attend the industry day event.


Industry Paper Requirement

All areas of the WI/IAT conference are of interest to the industry 
papers. The paper should be about industrial
or other real-world applications of WI/IAT. A description of how the 
application has been conceived, developed
and deployed must be provided. The industry papers will be 4 pages in 
length including the bibliography, and must
be submitted online at the conference websites. The submission must 
satisfy the style requirement as specified in
IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines. At 
least one author of each Industry-Track
paper should be from an industrial company or organization. The papers 
must indicate which track (WI or IAT) the
authors would like to include their papers. All papers submitted to the 
Industry Track will also be reviewed by a
dedicated Program Committee and the accepted papers will be included in 
the conference proceedings by the IEEE
