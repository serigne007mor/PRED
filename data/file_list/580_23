Organized in collaboration with the Intelligent Data Analysis and Data
Mining Working Group of the International Medical Informatics Association,
and Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining working Group of the American
Medical Informatics Association.

IMPORTANT DATES
Submission: =C2=A0 April 14, 2009
Notification: June 3, 2009
Camera-ready: June 24, 2009

Student challenge: April 1, 2009 - June 1, 2009.


GENERAL INFORMATION

IDAMAP-2009, a =C2=A0colloquium on intelligent data analysis in biomedicine
and pharmacology, will be held in conjunction with the 12th Conference
on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (http://aimedicine.info/aime09/) in
Verona, Italy.

The IDAMAP series is devoted to computational methods for data
analysis in medicine, biology and pharmacology that present results of
analysis in the form communicable to domain experts and that somehow
exploit knowledge of the problem domain. Such knowledge may be
available at different stages of the data-analysis and model-building
process. Typical methods include data visualization, data exploration,
machine learning, and data mining.

Gathering in an informal setting, colloquium participants will have the
opportunity to meet and discuss selected technical topics in an
atmosphere which fosters the active exchange of ideas among
researchers and practitioners. The colloquium is intended to be a
genuinely interactive event and not a mini-conference, thus ample time
will be allotted for general discussion. A student challenge on data
integration will be organized. Author of the best solution will be invited
to present the work at the workshop.

A selection of revised and expanded IDAMAP 2009 papers will appear in
the Methods of Information in Medicine journal.


TOPICS

In the colloquium, the attention will be given to methodological issues of
intelligent data analysis and on specific applications in biomedicine
and pharmacology. In terms of methodology, topics include, but are not
limited to:
- data mining and machine learning techniques for supervised and
=C2=A0unsupervised learning problems,
- exploiting domain knowledge in learning and data analysis,
- data visualization and exploration,
- analysis of large data sets and relational data mining,
- knowledge management and its integration with intelligent data
=C2=A0analysis techniques, and
- integration of intelligent data analysis techniques within
=C2=A0biomedical information systems.


A paper submitted to the colloquium is expected to show a selected
methodology can help to solve relevant problems in medicine, and
would typically address the following issues:
- What is the medical or clinical problem addressed?
- Was any prior knowledge available? How was this used in the
=C2=A0data analysis or interpretation of results?
- How is/can the newly discovered knowledge put into use?

Contributions that discuss particular applications of intelligent data
analysis techniques are invited, and can for example cover analysis of
medical and health-care data, data coming from clinical bioinformatics
data bases (like microarray data and DNA sequence analysis), analysis of
pharmacological data, drug design, drug testing, and outcomes analysis.


PROBLEM OWNERS

In addition to regular scientific contributions, we welcome descriptions
of problems or data sets that could potentially benefit from an analysis
through Intelligent Data Analysis or Data Mining. Problem descriptions
must be submitted as abstracts and will be presented at the workshop.
They must briefly introduce the problem and provide an overview of
the main objectives of the analysis. After the presentations, ample
time will be reserved for discussion.


DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS

We also invite developers of data analysis tools to send an abstract
with the description of their tool, and give a demonstration during a
special demo session on data analysis tools at the colloquium. The
abstract should describe the underlying methodology of the tool and
sketch the potential for application in the field of intelligent data
analysis in biomedicine. Preferably, abstracts on data analysis tools
should also briefly describe a case study where the tool was used.


STUDENT CHALLENGE

The challenge will involve applying methods for intelligent and integrative
data analysis on multiple source of data. The task will be to build
a predictive model and use it to classify a set of test examples. A web
page will be available for data access and submission of predictions,
starting in April, 2009.


PROGRAM

The scientific program of the colloquium will consist of presentations of
accepted scientific papers, an invited presentation, and demonstrations
of data analysis tools and problem descriptions. Ample time will be
allotted for informal discussion among the participants.


SUBMISSION & PUBLICATION OF ACCEPTED PAPERS

IDAMAP invites submissions of either short papers (2 pages, up to 1500
words, leading to a short presentation at the meeting) or full papers
(up to 6 pages/4500 words, leading to a long presentation at the
meeting). Data analysis tools and description of problems should be
submitted as abstracts (1 page, up to 750 words). Papers should be
written in English. Authors should send an electronic submission in PDF
format to both chairs (tomaz.curk@fri.uni-lj.si, lucia.sacchi@unipv.it);
please use "IDAMAP SUBMISSION YOUR_NAME" as a subject, where
YOUR_NAME is the surname of the first author. Alternatively to
preferred PDF, submissions using Post Script or MS Word format are
also welcome.

The submissions should be received no later than April 14, 2009.
Formatting instructions and instructions for authors are available on
the IDAMAP 2009 home page at http://idamap.org/idamap2009.

Submissions will be reviewed by at least two people of the program
committee. Authors will be notified of acceptance/rejection by
June 3, 2009. Accepted papers will appear in colloquium notes that
will be distributed among registered participants.


JOURNAL PUBLICATION

A selection of contributors to IDAMAP 2009 will be invited to submit
a revised and expanded version of their paper for publication in Schattauer=
=92s
Methods of Information in Medicine journal (www.methods-online.com).
Publication is scheduled for late 2009/early 2010.


REGISTRATION
Details on payment and registration will be posted shortly on the AIME and
IDAMAP 2009 pages.
