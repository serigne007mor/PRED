ECML PKDD 2008
The European Conference on Machine Learning and
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases
***********************************************************

September 15-19, 2008
Antwerp, Belgium
http://www.ecmlpkdd2008.org/

Key Dates
Paper Submission deadline: April 25
Paper Acceptance Notification: June 13
Paper Camera Ready: June 22

Call For Papers
***************

The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and
Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases intends to provide an
international forum for the discussion of the latest high quality
research results in all areas related to machine learning and
knowledge discovery in databases. Submissions of papers that describe
the application of machine learning and data mining methods to real-
world problems are encouraged, particularly exploratory research that
describes novel learning and mining tasks and applications requiring
non-standard techniques. Submissions that demonstrate both theoretical
and empirical rigor are especially encouraged.

Proceedings
***********

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer. A selection
of papers will be directly published in the Machine Learning Journal
or in the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal. All other
accepted submissions will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence Series.

Submissions
***********

ECML PKDD 2008 will not accept any paper which, at the time of
submission, is under review or has already been accepted for
publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also
expected not to submit their papers elsewhere during the review period
of ECML PKDD 2008.
The papers must be in English and must be formatted according to the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence guidelines.
Authors instructions and style files can be downloaded at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html .
The maximum length of papers is at most 16 pages in this format.
Papers submitted to ECML PKDD 2008 will normally be reviewed by three
referees. There will be no "blind review" process. Student submissions
should be clearly indicated on the submission form.
