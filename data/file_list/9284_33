Context

A major trend of work in complex network modeling and mining concerns analy=
zing homogeneous static networks (i.e. one snapshot of a network). However,=
 in real world settings, networks are often dynamic, heterogeneous, and bot=
h nodes and links can be described by a set of attributes. The concept of m=
ultiplex network has been recently proposed to ease modeling real work netw=
orks. A multiplex network is often represented as a multi-layer network com=
posed of  a set of nodes related to each other with different types of rela=
tions. On the other hand, the concept of attributed network has also been i=
ntroduced recently to take into account the fact that the vertices of the n=
etwork are described by attributes like for instance their genre or age. Th=
ese representations are much richer than simple complex networks often used=
 to model complex interaction systems. However, this poses the challenge to=
 provide adequate answers to all basic network analysis tasks that have bee=
n studied and provided in the recent few years for the case of homogeneous =
networks without attributes. This include for instance: the problem of node=
 ranking (computing nodes centralities), community detection, link predicti=
on, information diffusion models and network visualization. Almost all work=
 in the field of multiplex network analysis are based on transforming the p=
roblem, in a way or another to the classical case of homogeneous network an=
alysis. Existing approaches for multiplex networks analysis include: layer =
aggregation based approaches or applying ensemble methods on results obtain=
ed on each layer aside. Little work has focused on analyzing all layers at =
once.  First propositions have also been done to adapt community detection =
algorithms for attributed networks but there is  a need for an in-depth ana=
lysis. The goal of this workshop is make the point on new approaches for mu=
ltiplex and attributed network mining.

In the context of this workshop, we  encourage contributions on methods and=
 techniques that are transversal to every application domains, rather than =
focusing on specific issues concerning each domain separately. We will cons=
ider the two main aspects of network analysis: modeling and knowledge disco=
very.=20
