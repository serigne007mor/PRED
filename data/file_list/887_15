2006
and aims at fostering the presentation for high quality research work
in network and system security in the beautiful city of Annecy.
The goal of this event is to provide a framework for exchanges among 
academic researchers,
 industry, graduate students and a broader audience interested in 
network and system security.
The conference will offer a broad area of events, ranging from panels, 
tutorials,
technical presentations and informal meetings.

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers offering novel 
research contributions
in network and system security as well as proposals for tutorials and 
panels.
Submissions can address both theoretical issues in network
and system security or provide practical and operational experience in 
security management.
