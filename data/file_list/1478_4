Call for Workshop Proposals


The SDM2010 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops and
mini-symposia to be held in conjunction with the conference. The
purpose of a workshop is to provide participants with the opportunity
to present and discuss novel research ideas on active and emerging
topics of knowledge discovery and data mining. Ideally a workshop
should foster interactions between different communities within the
scope of SDM (e.g. statisticians, computer scientists, industry,
academia etc.). A workshop should not be a mini-conference, but rather
it should encourage the presentation of novel ideas, even if they are
in an early stage of development, contact between different points of
view, and active exchanges between participants. Therefore publishing
proceeding is optional for the SDM workshops.

In addition to workshops, SDM 2010 will also accept proposals for
mini-symposia. The concept of a mini-symposium is relatively new to the
data mining community and it should be considered a small coordinated
set of presentations on a coherent sub-topic of importance. Typically
a mini-symposium may be given only about 2 hours (3-4 presentations),
whereas a workshop may be full day or half day. Since the concept of a
mini-symposium is new to the data mining community, we have included a
pointer to a URL, which explains this concept:

  http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm10/minisymp-guidelines

We will also consider proposals for a full day workshop that includes
a two-hour mini-symposium as its first session.

The responsibilities of the workshop/mini-symposium organizers include
(1) preparing the call for papers and publicizing
it, (2) maintaining the workshop/symposium web site, (3) deciding the
workshop/symposium program content; this may optionally include
inviting speakers, inviting reviewers, selecting the papers through a
peer review process (4) delivering the proceedings to the press in
time (if the workshop organizers decide to publish proceedings), and
(5) delivering the final workshop/mini-symposium program to the
workshop chair in time.

Workshop/Mini-symposium proposals should be prepared as a web page
and its URL is sent via e-mail to the SDM2010 Workshop Chair: You
will receive an acknowledgment of receipt within 24 hours. Please
ping us if you do not receive a receipt within 24 hours.

Please send the URL to Charu Aggarwal (charu@us.ibm.com) and Marina
Meila (mmp@stat.washington.edu) by October 9, 2009.

A workshop proposal should include the following information:

1. Workshop/Mini-symposium title
2. Full contact information of the organizers
3. Description of the workshop/mini-symposium including objectives,
content, topics of interest. For workshops, a description of the format 
( e.g invited talks,
  round table, accepted presentations, etc) should be included.

Please indicate your preference regarding the length of the workshop:
Half-day or full-day.  If you are only interested in hosting a full
day workshop then please indicate so.

4. A short description of the target audience.

5. List of potential participants:
For workshops this could include
potential program committee members, potential authors and
invited speakers.
For mini-symposium this could include a list of speakers and talk titles.

6. A summary of previous editions of the workshop (if it was run
before), with an emphasis on number of attendees and paper
submissions.

7. A short biography of each organizer.

Proposals will be judged by a sub-committee of the SDM2010 organizing
committee based on the above information.

Particular preference will be given to proposals that demonstrate the
ability to foster interactions among multiple communities, as noted
above. We prefer workshops in which there is participation of diverse
people who may not have worked with one another in the past, or which
bridge between traditional SDM topics and communities and other fields.
External sources of funding or sponsorship for special events
held along with the workshop (e.g. invited talks, poster session) can
be optionally included in the proposal submission.

For any question regarding the workshops and mini-symposia for
SDM2010, please contact the workshop co-chairs.

Submission of Workshop and Mini-Symposia Proposals: October 9th.

Notifications: October 23th 2009.
