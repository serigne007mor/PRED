The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice 
of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) will take place in 
Würzburg, Germany, from September 16th to 20th, 2019 
(http://ecmlpkdd2019.org).


CALL FOR TUTORIALS
******************
The ECML PKDD 2019 Organizing Committee invites proposals for half-day 
tutorials to be held on the first and last days of the conference 
(September 16th and 20th, 2019).
Tutorials are intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to 
established or emerging research topics of interest to the machine 
learning and data mining community. These topics include related 
research fields or applications but also well-developed tools and suites 
that support ML/DM research. The ideal tutorial should attract a wide 
audience. It should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to 
the chosen area, but it should also cover the most important topics in 
depth.

More information: http://ecmlpkdd2019.org/submissions/tutorials/

Proposal deadline: March 22, 2019
Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 5, 2019



CALL FOR WORKSHOPS
*******************
The ECML PKDD 2019 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops 
to be held on the first and last days of the conference (September 16th 
and 20th, 2019).
We invite proposals for both full- and half-day workshops in current and 
emerging topics in machine learning and data mining. Workshops provide 
an opportunity to discuss novel topics in a small and interactive 
atmosphere. They can concentrate in-depth on research topics, but can 
also be devoted to application domains or issues, or to questions 
concerning the economic and social aspects of machine learning and data 
mining. Multidisciplinary workshops that bring together researchers and 
practitioners from different communities are particularly welcome.

More information: http://ecmlpkdd2019.org/submissions/tutorials/

Proposal deadline: March 22, 2019
Proposal Acceptance notification: April 5, 2019
Workshop websites and call for papers online: April 19, 2019


CONTACT INFORMATION
********************
In case you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us 
at wt_chairs@ecmlpkdd2019.org. We are looking forward to your proposals.
