                   *** Paper Submission deadline July 15th, 2008 ***
                ***Apologies for multiple posting of this call for paper***

                        The 4th International SITIS 2008 conference
                             November 30th - December 3rd, 2008
                                     Bali Dynasty Resort
                                       Bali, Indonesia
    (in cooperation with ACM SigApp.fr, IFIP TC 2 WG 2.13, IEEE CS pending...)

Objectives:
----------

The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to
represent, share and process information in various forms, ranging from signal,
image, and multimedia data to traditional structured data and semi-structured
data found in the web. SITIS spans two inter-related research domains that
increasingly play a key role in connecting systems across network centric
environments to allow distributed computing and information sharing.

SITIS 2006 aims to provide a forum for high quality presentations on research
activities centered on four main tracks:

*The focus of the track "Information Management & Retrieval Technologies" (IMRT)
is on the emerging modeling, representation and retrieval techniques that take
into account the amount, type and diversity of information accessible in
distributed computing environment.

*The track "Web-Based Information Technologies & Distributed Systems" (WITDS) is
devoted to emerging and novel concepts, architectures and methodologies for
creating an interconnected world in which information can be exchanged easily,
tasks can be processed collaboratively, and communities of users with similarly
interests can be formed while addressing security threats that are present more
than ever before.

*The track "Signal & Image Technologies" (SIT) focuses on recent developments in
digital signal processing and pays particular attention to evolutions in
audiovisual signal processing, analysis, coding and authentication, and
retrieval techniques.

*The 4th track focuses on new software engineering method for Open Source
Software Development and Solution (OSSDS) in distributed and large scaled
environments, strategies for promoting, adopting, and using Open Source
Solutions and case studies or success stories in specific domains.

SITIS is also dedicated to bring together scientists from the world over,
particularly from developing countries, to share and exchange knowledge,
experience and research results. When the conference is hosted by research
institutions in developing countries, a particular emphasis will be placed on
the presentation of applied research, the organization of practical tutorials
and workshops that may help address the information processing needs of these
countries, and book give away sessions to allow conference attendees to donate 
books to the local institutions.

Important Dates:
---------------

Tutorial proposals             : July 15th, 2008
Paper Submission               : June 15th, 2008
Acceptance/Reject notification : August 15th, 2008
Final paper/registration       : September 7th, 2008

Submission and publication:
--------------------------

The conference will include keynote addresses, tutorials and regular and
workshop sessions. SITIS 20008 invites submission of high quality and original
papers on the topics of the major tracks described below. All submitted papers
will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers for technical merit,
originality, significance and relevance to track topics.
Papers must be up to 10 pages and follow IEEE double columns publication format.
All submissions are to be done online at: http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/SITIS/08

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by
IEEE Computer Society and referenced in IEEE explore and major indexes.
