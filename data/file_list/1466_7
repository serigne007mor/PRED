         CALL FOR ABSTRACTS - PSB Workshop: GPD-Rxn Workshop
=======================================================================

  GPD-Rxn WORKSHOP: Genotype-Phenotype-Drug Relationship Extraction from
Text

         Co-located with the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing,
             January 4-8 2010, The Big Island of Hawaii

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on the
automatic or semi-automatic extraction of relationships between
biomedical entities from research literature. The workshop will focus
particularly on methods for the extraction of Genotype-Phenotype,
Genotype-Drug, and Phenotype-Drug relationships and the use of the
relationships for advancing pharmacogenomic research.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
Advances in concept recognition have led to the development of various
tools that enable the identification of biomedical entities and
relationships between them in text. The aim of the GPD-Rxn workshop is
to examine the current state of art and discuss the next steps for
making the extraction of relationships between biomedical entities
integral to the curation and knowledge management workflow in
Pharmacogenomics. The workshop will focus particularly on the extraction
of Genotype-Phenotype, Genotype-Drug, and Phenotype-Drug relationships
that are of interest to Pharmacogenomics.
Extracting and structuring such text-mined relationships is a key to
support the evaluation and the validation of multiple hypotheses that
emerge form high throughput translational studies spanning multiple
measurement modalities. In order to advance this agenda, it is essential
that existing relationship extraction methods be compared to one another
and that a community wide benchmark corpus emerges; against which future
methods can be compared. The workshop aims to bring together researchers
working on the automatic or semi-automatic extraction of relationships
between biomedical entities from research literature in order to
identify the key groups interested in creating such a benchmark.

IMPORTANT TOPICS RELEVANT TO THIS WORKSHOP
    * Natural Language Processing methods for the extraction of
relationships
    * Machine learning methods for the characterization of biomedical
relationships
    * Use of prior knowledge to improve relationship extraction
    * Ontologies for relationships
    * Applications and uses of text-extracted relationships
Approaches that combine text-mining and knowledge-based systems are of
special interest.

ABSTRACTS
We are soliciting both research and position abstracts (up to 500 words)
related to the topics mentioned above. The GPD-Rxn workshop will combine
invited talks, talks selected from abstract submissions to this call,
and a panel discussion. Submitted abstracts that will be reviewed by the
co-chairs for selecting submitted talks. In addition, other relevant
submissions will have the possibility to be presented a poster-session
at the end of the workshop. Workshop participants must register for PSB;
abstracts may be submitted prior to registering. Authors of accepted
abstracts must register for PSB as soon as they are notified of paper
acceptance.

Abstracts should be emailed to Adrien Coulet (coulet at stanford dot edu).
