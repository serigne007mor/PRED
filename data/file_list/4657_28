CONTEXT
The huge amount of data currently produced by modern Earth Observation =
(EO) missions has raised up new challenges for the Remote Sensing =
communities. EO sen- sors are now able to offer (very) high spatial =
resolution images with revisit time frequencies never achieved before =
considering different kind of signals, e.g., multi- (hyper)spectral =
optical, radar, LiDAR and Digital Surface Models. In addition, con- =
sidering successive acquisitions of satellite imagery over the same =
area, it is also possible to organize these data as satellite image time =
series (SITS), in order to track and monitor phenomena over time.
In this context, modern machine learning techniques can play a crucial =
role to deal with such amount of heterogeneous, multi-scale and =
multi-modal data. Some examples of techniques that are gaining attention =
in this domain include deep learn- ing, domain adaptation, =
semi-supervised approach, time series analysis and active learning. =
Leveraging Machine Learning approaches for the analysis of EO data can =
be beneficial (or even crucial) for several EO-related tasks such as =
precision agri- culture and food risk prevention, mapping biodiversity, =
monitoring climate changes, understanding temporal trajectories related =
to the evolution of natural habitats and generally, manage resources in =
a territory and provide more accurate information on environmental and =
anthropic phenomena.
Even though the use of machine learning and the development of ad-hoc =
techniques are gaining increasing popularity in the EO domain, we can =
witness that a significant lack of interaction between domain experts =
and machine learning re- searchers still exists. People coming from =
these two different communities, currently, may often have some =
difficulties in structuring themselves around these issues due to a lack =
of mutual knowledge.
The objective of this workshop is to supply an international forum where =
machine learning researchers and domain-experts can meet each other, in =
order to exchange, debate and draw short and long term research =
objectives around the exploitation and analysis of EO data via Machine =
Learning techniques. Among the workshop=E2=80=99s objec- tives, we want =
to give an overview of the current machine learning researches dealing =
with EO data, and, on the other hand, we want to stimulate concrete =
discussions to pave the way to new machine learning frameworks =
especially tailored to deal with such data.
