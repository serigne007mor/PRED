3rd ISC HPC International Workshop on Monitoring & Operational Data =
Analytics (MODA22)
June 02, 2022, Hamburg, Germany

Following very successful previous editions initiated at ISC HPC, we are =
inviting contributions to the 3rd ISC HPC International Workshop on =
Monitoring and Operational Data Analytics (MODA22). The goal of the MODA =
workshop series is to provide a venue for sharing insight into current =
trends in MODA, to identify potential gaps, and offer an outlook into =
the future of the involved fields: high performance computing, =
databases, machine learning, and possible solutions that can contribute =
to the design and procurement of upcoming Exascale systems.

Abstract:         Feb 21, 2022 (AoE)
Paper submission: Feb 28, 2022 (AoE)
Notification:     March 28, 2022
Camera-ready:     one month after June 02, 2022
MODA22 workshop:  June 02, 2022, Hamburg, Germany

=3D=3D=3D Goals

While MODA is already a common practice at various HPC sites, each site =
adopts a different, insular approach, not always adopted in production =
environments, and mostly limited to the visualization of the system and =
building infrastructure metrics for health check purposes. In this =
regard, we observe a gap between the collection of operational data and =
its meaningful and effective analysis and exploitation, which prevents =
the closing of the feedback loop between the monitored HPC system, its =
operation, and its end-users. Under these premises, the goals of the =
MODA22 workshop can then be summarized in the following way:

(1) Gather and share knowledge and establish a common ground within the =
international community with respect to best practices in monitoring and =
operational data analytics.

(2) Discuss future strategies and alternatives for MODA, potentially =
improving existing solutions and envisioning a common baseline approach =
in HPC sites and data centers.

(3) Establish a debate on the usefulness and applicability of AI/ML =
techniques on collected operational data for optimizing the operation of =
production systems (e.g., for practices such as predictive maintenance, =
runtime optimization, optimal resource allocation and scheduling).

=3D=3D=3D Scope

We seek novel research ideas that align with the above goals and match =
(see note below) the scope of the MODA workshop series:

(a) Challenges, solutions, and best practices for monitoring systems at =
data centers and HPC sites. Significant focus will be placed on =
operational data collection mechanisms respectively:
- covering different system levels, from building infrastructure sensor =
data to CPU-core performance metrics, and=20
- targeting different end-users, from system administrators and =
operators to application developers, computer scientists, and =
computational scientists.

(b) Effective strategies for analyzing and interpreting the collected =
operational data. Such strategies should particularly include (but are =
not limited to):
- different visualization approaches and=20
- machine learning-based techniques, potentially inferring knowledge of =
the system behavior and allowing for the realization of a proactive =
control loop.

Note: New solutions proposed in the context of application performance =
modeling and/or application performance analysis tools fall outside the =
scope of MODA. Novel contributions in the area of compiler analysis, =
debugging, programming models and/or sustainability of scientific =
software are also considered out of the scope of the workshop.

=3D=3D=3D Topics

We cordially invite you to submit your contributions to the MODA22 =
workshop, in the form of short (6 pages) and full (12 pages) =
submissions, that address but are not limited to:
* Monitoring and operational data analysis challenges and approaches =
(data collection, storage, visualization, integration into system =
software, adoption).
* State-of-the-practice method, tools, techniques in monitoring at =
various HPC sites
* Solutions for monitoring and analysis of operational data that work =
very well on large- to extreme-scale systems, with a large number of =
users.
* Solutions that have proven limitations in terms of efficiency of =
operational data collection  in real-time or in terms of the quality of =
the collected data.
* Opportunities and challenges of using machine learning methods for =
efficient monitoring and analysis of operational data.
* Integration of monitoring and analysis practices into production =
system software (energy and resource management) and runtime systems =
(scheduling and resource allocation).
* Explicit gaps between operational data collection, processing, =
effective analysis, impactful exploitation; new approaches for closing =
these gaps for the benefit of improving HPC center planning, operations, =
and research.
* Means to identify misuse, intentional or unintentional, of resources, =
and methods to mitigate the effects of these: taking automatic steps to =
contain the effects of one application/job/user allocation on others, =
supporting users to identify causes for the misbehavior of their =
application, linking to intrusion detection and safe multitenancy.
* Concepts to integrate MODA into the system design at all levels, =
including dedicated hardware components, middleware features, and tool =
support that make =E2=80=98monitoring by default=E2=80=99 a viable =
option without sacrificing performance.
* FAIR data practices, including sharing of monitoring workflows and =
tools across sites while ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations and =
user access agreements.

=3D=3D=3D Submission and Publication

All papers submitted to MODA22 must be original and not simultaneously =
submitted to another venue. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the =
program committee members and accepted papers are expected to be =
presented during the workshop.

Papers should be submitted through the EasyChair online system at =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmoda22 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmoda22>. Papers are required =
to be formatted according to the ISC research papers guidelines using =
LNCS style (see Springer=E2=80=99s website):
* Single-column format.
* Maximum 6 (six) for short papers or 12 (twelve) pages for full papers =
(including figures and references).
* Use Springer=E2=80=99s LaTeX document class or Word template (see =
Springer=E2=80=99s Proceedings Guidelines).

The workshop chairs reserve the right to reject incorrectly formatted =
papers.=20

The MODA22 workshop papers will be published together with the ISC HPC =
2022 post-conference proceedings (published by Springer LNCS), including =
an abstract of the keynote and invited talks, and a description of the =
panel session.=20
