Subject: [liste-egc] [SPAM] 2nd CFP: Workshop on Semantic Web for Scientific
 Heritage, SW4SH in conjunction with ESCW 2015

** apologies for cross-posting **

First Int. Workshop on Semantic Web for Scientific Heritage SW4SH 2015, 
in conjunction with ESWC 2015

http://www.cepam.cnrs.fr/zoomathia/sw4sh/

Important dates:
- March 16, 2015: paper submission deadline
- April 3, 2015: Notification of paper acceptance
- April 17, 2015: Camera ready version
- June 1, 2015 : Workshop date


The first International Workshop on Semantic Web for Scientific Heritage 
will be held in conjunction with the 12th ESWC 2015 Conference on June 
1, in Portoroz, Slovenia and will provide a leading international and 
interdisciplinary forum for disseminating the latest research in the 
field of Semantic Web for the preservation and exploitation of our 
scientific heritage, the study of the history of ideas and their 
transmission.

Classicists and historians are interested in developing textual 
databases, in order to gather and explore large amounts of primary 
source materials. For a long time, they mainly focused on text 
digitization and markup. They only recently decided to try to explore 
the possibility of transferring some analytical processes they 
previously thought incompatible with automation to knowledge engineering 
systems, thus taking advantage of the growing set of tools and 
techniques based on the languages and standards of the semantic Web, 
such as linked data, ontologies, and automated reasoning. The 
iconographic data, which are also relevant in history of science and 
arise similar problematic could be addressed as well and offer 
suggestive insights for a global methodology for diverse media.

On the other hand, Semantic Web researchers are willing to take up more 
ambitious challenges than those arising in the native context of the Web 
in terms of anthropological complexity, addressing meta-semantic 
problems of flexible, pluralist or evolutionary ontologies, sources 
heterogeneity, hermeneutic and rhetoric dimensions. Thus the opportunity 
for a fruitful encounter of knowledge engineers with computer-savvy 
historians and classicists has come. This encounter may be inscribed 
within the more general context of digital humanities, a research area 
at the intersection of computing and the humanities disciplines which is 
gaining an ever-increasing momentum and where the Linked Open Data is 
playing an increasingly prominent role.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion about 
the methodological approaches to the specificity of annotating 
“scientific” texts (in the wide sense of the term, including disciplines 
such as history, architecture, or rhetoric), and to support a 
collaborative reflection, on possible guidelines or specific models for 
building historical ontologies. A key goal of the workshop is to 
emphasize, through precise projects and up-to-date investigation in 
digital humanities, the benefit of a multidisciplinary research to 
create and operate on relevantly structured data. One of the main 
interests of the very topic of pre-modern historical data management 
lies in historical semantics, and the opportunity to jointly consider 
how to identify and express lexical, theoretical and material 
evolutions. Dealing with historical material, a major problem is indeed 
to handle the discrepancy of the historical terminology compared to the 
modern one, and, in the case of massive, diachronic data, to take into 
account the contextual and theoretical meaning of words and sentences 
and their semantics. Papers on ancient and medieval biological science 
and zoology are particularly welcome.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
- Ontologies and vocabularies in Ancient Science
- Semantic annotation of ancient and medieval scientific texts
- Information/knowledge extraction from archaeological objects and texts
- Semantic integration of heterogeneous and contradicting knowledge
- Representation of the historical dimension of Scientific Knowledge
- Impact of Semantic Web technologies on Digital Humanities
- Knowledge Engineering for ancient zoological science and literature
- Social Web, collaborative systems, tagging, and user feedback
