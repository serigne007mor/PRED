General Information.=20

The preceding editions of the FCA4AI Workshop (from ECAI 2012 until IJCAI 2=
021) showed that many researchers working in Artificial Intelligence are in=
deed interested by powerful techniques for classification and data mining p=
rovided by Formal Concept Analysis. Again, we have the chance to organize t=
he 10th edition of the workshop in Vienna, co-located with the IJCAI-ECAI 2=
022 Conference.=20

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory aimed=
 at data analysis and classification. FCA allows one to build a concept lat=
tice and a system of dependencies (implications and association rules) whic=
h can be used for many AI needs, e.g. knowledge processing, knowledge disco=
very, knowledge representation and reasoning, ontology engineering as well =
as information retrieval, recommendation, social network analysis and text =
processing. Thus, there are many ``natural links'' between FCA and AI.=20

Recent years have been witnessing increased scientific activity around FCA,=
 in particular a strand of work emerged that is aimed at extending the poss=
ibilities of plain FCA w.r.t. knowledge processing, such as work on pattern=
 structures and relational context analysis, as well as on hybridization wi=
th other formalisms. These extensions are aimed at allowing FCA to deal wit=
h more complex than just binary data, for solving complex problems in data =
analysis, classification, knowledge processing... While the capabilities of=
 FCA are extended, new possibilities are arising in the framework of FCA.=
=20

As usual, the FCA4AI workshop is dedicated to the discussion of such issues=
, and in particular:=20
- How can FCA support AI activities in knowledge discovery, knowledge repre=
sentation and reasoning, machine learning, natural language processing...=
=20
- By contrast, how the current developments in AI can be integrated within =
FCA to help AI researchers solve complex problems in their domain,=20
- Which role can be played by FCA in the new trends in AI, especially in ML=
, XAI, fairness of algorithms, and ``hybrid systems'' combining symbolic an=
d subsymbolic approaches.=20

TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to:=20

- Concept lattices and related structures: pattern structures, relational s=
tructures, distributive lattices.=20
- Knowledge discovery and data mining:=20
pattern mining, association rules, attribute implications, subgroup discove=
ry, exceptional model mining, data dependencies, attribute exploration, sta=
bility, projections, interestingness measures, MDL principle, mining of com=
plex data, triadic and polyadic analysis.=20
- Knowledge and data engineering: knowledge representation, reasoning, onto=
logy engineering, mining the web of data, text mining, data quality checkin=
g.=20
- Analyzing the potential of FCA in supporting hybrid systems: how to combi=
ne FCA and data mining algorithms, such as deep learning for building hybri=
d knowledge discovery systems, producing explanations, and assessing system=
 fairness.=20
- Analyzing the potential of FCA in AI tasks such as classification, cluste=
ring, biclustering, information retrieval, navigation, recommendation, text=
 processing, visualization, pattern recognition, analysis of social network=
s.=20
- Practical applications in agronomy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, financ=
e, manufacturing, medicine...=20

The workshop will include time for audience discussion aimed at better unde=
rstanding of of the issues, challenges, and ideas being presented.=20

IMPORTANT DATES:=20
