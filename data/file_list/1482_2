                       CALL FOR PAPERS
======================================================================

      Tenth SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM2010)

                  April 29th - May 1st 2010
                    Columbus, Ohio, USA

              http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm10/
   Facebook Group: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=76853478498


Data mining is an important tool in science, engineering, industrial
processes, healthcare, business, and medicine. The datasets in these
fields are large, complex, and often noisy.  Extracting knowledge
requires the use of sophisticated, high-performance and principled
analysis techniques and algorithms, based on sound theoretical and
statistical foundations. These techniques in turn require
implementations that are carefully tuned for performance; powerful
visualization technologies; interface systems that are usable by
scientists, engineers, and physicians as well as researchers; and
infrastructures that support them.

This conference provides a venue for researchers who are addressing
these problems to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. It
also provides an ideal setting for graduate students and others new
to the field to learn about cutting-edge research by hearing
outstanding invited speakers and attending presentations and tutorials
(included with conference registration). A set of focused workshops
are also held on the last day of the conference. The proceedings of
the conference are published in archival form, and are also made
available on the SIAM web site.
