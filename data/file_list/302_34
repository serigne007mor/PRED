PKAW 2008 - The 2008 Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop
Hanoi, Vietnam, 15 - 19 December 2008


The Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshops (PKAW) have provided a=20
forum for the past two decades for researchers and practitioners in the=20
Pacific region working in the area of knowledge acquisition. PKAW covers=20
a spectrum of techniques and approaches ranging from manual knowledge=20
acquisition from a human expert to fully automated knowledge acquisition=20
using machine learning or data mining methods. With the growing=20
recognition of the pivotal role that knowledge plays in the=20
sustainability, competitiveness and growth of an organisation, together=20
with the difficulties associated with effectively managing knowledge,=20
finding solutions to address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is=20
even more important in today=A1=AFs society than in the early beginnings of=
=20
this field. This workshop will explore and disseminate the latest solutions.

As a field within the larger field of Artificial Intelligence (AI),=20
solutions incorporating other areas of AI such as ontological=20
engineering, agent based technology, robotics, image recognition and the=20
Semantic Web are common, as are knowledge acquisition methods related to=20
other fields of computing such as databases, the Internet, information=20
retrieval, language technology and game technology. Many solutions are=20
application focussed addressing real world problems such as knowledge=20
reuse, sharing, merging and reconciliation within a wide range of=20
problem domains.
Topics of Interest

Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects of knowledge=20
acquisition for knowledge-based systems, including (but not restricted to):

    * Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge=20
acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge engineering
    * Algorithmic approaches to knowledge acquisition
    * Tools and techniques for knowledge acquisition, knowledge=20
maintenance and knowledge validation
    * Evaluation of knowledge acquisition techniques, tools and methods
    * Knowledge acquisition and machine learning
    * Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modelling=20
information systems or decision support systems
    * Methods and techniques for sharing and reusing knowledge
    * Distributed knowledge acquisition through infrastructures such as=20
the Internet
    * Ontology acquisition and the role of ontologies in knowledge=20
acquisition
    * The implications of the Semantic Web for knowledge acquisition
    * The role of agents in knowledge acquisition
    * Data mining and machine learning
    * Business Rules, Knowledge Acquisition and Software Engineering
