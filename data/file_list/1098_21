CALL FOR PAPERS 



Business Process Intelligence (BPI) is an emerging area that is gaining interest and importance in industry and research. BPI involves the application of various analysis and mining techniques in the area of business process management. In practice, BPI can be supported by tools for measuring the quality of process execution through several features such as analysis, prediction, monitoring, control, and optimization.



The goal of this workshop is to bring together new contributions in terms of the approaches and techniques that are required to support business processes and to understand the way they are handled at runtime. The workshop is open to researchers and practitioners from different communities, such as business process management, information systems research, business administration, software engineering, artificial intelligence, process mining and data mining who share an interest in the analysis of business processes and process-aware information systems. The workshop aims at discussing the current state of ongoing research and sharing practical experiences. 



The list of topics that are relevant to the BPI workshop includes, but is not limited to, the following:



Analysis Techniques at design time and/or runtime:



    - Mining of business processes

    - Statistical analysis in the business process management lifecycle

    - Reasoning related to business process

    - Business process visualization

    - Machine-learning and business processes

    - Measurement of business process models and business process modelling

    - Retrieval related to business process management

    - Similarity related to processes and cases

    - Integration of processes and process models

    - Mathematical optimization

    - Simulation of business processes



Applications of such analysis techniques and case studies in:



    - Performance Measurement of business processes

    - Business Process Reengineering

    - Business Process Quality

    - Emergent workflows

    - Process discovery

    - Conformance and risk management for business processes

    - Operations Management and Six Sigma

    - Data warehousing

    - Static and dynamic optimization

    - Self-management

    - Monitoring of business processes

    - Resource Allocation in business processes

    - Prediction

    - Dynamic composition of business processes





Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for presentation in any of the areas listed above. Only papers in English will be accepted. Length of full papers must not exceed 12 pages, and there is no possibility to buy additional pages. Position papers should be no longer than 6 pages. Papers should be submitted in the new LNBIP format. Papers have to present original research contributions not concurrently submitted elsewhere. The title page must contain a short abstract, a classification of the topics covered, preferably using the list of topics above, and an indication of the submission category (regular paper or position paper). Papers (preferably in PDF format) should be submitted electronically. Members of an international and solid program committee will review all submissions. Each paper will be reviewed by 3 PC members guaranteeing that only papers presenting high quality and innovative research and practice issues in areas relevant to the workshop theme will be accepted.
