Subject: [liste-egc] [SPAM] ECAI 2020 - 1st International Workshop on New
 Foundations for Human-Centered AI

======================================================================
=  NeHuAI-2020
=  1st International Workshop on New Foundations for Human-Centered AI
=  June 9, Santiago de Compostela, Spain (Part of ECAI-2020)
=  http://nehuai2020.aass.oru.se/
======================================================================

                     * Second Call for Papers *

SYNOPSIS
--------

In June 2018, the European Commission has appointed a "AI High Level
Expert Group" (AI-HLEG) to support the implementation of the European
Strategy on Artificial Intelligence.  One of the first results of the
AI-HLEG has been to deliver ethics guidelines on Artificial Intelligence
(https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines).
These guidelines put forward a human-centered approach to AI, and list
seven key requirements that human-centered, trustworthy AI systems
should meet, summarized by the following headers:

1. Human agency and oversight
2. Technical robustness and safety
3. Privacy and data governance
4. Transparency
5. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness
6. Societal and environmental wellbeing
7. Accountability

Many of today's most popular AI methods, however, fail to meet these
guidelines: making them compliant is a scientific endeavor that is as
crucial as it is challenging and stimulating.  Systems based on deep
learning are a case in point: while these systems often provide
impressive results, their ability to _explain_ these results to the user
is very limited, challenging requirements 4 and 7; in most cases we lack
ways to formally _verify_ their correctness and assess their boundary
conditions, challenging requirement 2; and we don't yet have methods to
allow humans to _collaboratively_ influence or question their decisions,
challenging requirement 1.  Similar criticalities are present in many
other popular AI methods.

This full day workshop will collectively address the fundamental
questions of what are the scientific and technological gaps that we have
to fill in order to make AI systems _human-centered_ in terms of the
above guidelines.

PAPER SUBMISSION
----------------

Contributions are seeked on new foundations for building Human-Centered
AI systems, able to comply with AI-HLEG recommendations. Contributions
may present mature results, but position papers and reports of relevant
ongoing work may also be acceptable.  More specific topics include, but
are not limited to:

- Explainable AI
- Verifiable AI
- Technical robustness and safety of AI systems
- Collaboration between humans and AI systems
- Integrating model-based and data-driven AI
- Integrating symbolic- and sub-symbolic AI
- Mixed initiative AI-Human systems
- Proactive AI systems in human environments
- Understanding and naturally interacting with humans
- Understanding and interaction in complex social settings
- Reflexivity and expectation managament
- Integrating Learning, Reasoning and Acting in AI systems

Papers should be formatted according to the ECAI2020 formatting style,
available at the ECAI2020 website (ecai2020.eu), and should not exceed
six pages.  Submissions are not anonymous.

Submit your paper by February 25 via Easychair here:
