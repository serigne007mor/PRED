CALL FOR PAPERS
CARI 2024 - African Conference on Research in Computer Science and =
Applied Mathematics - Digital Science in Africa
Bejaia, Algeria, November, 2024
------------
=20
CARI (http://www.cari-info.org/), the African Conference on Research in =
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, is the outcome of an =
international cooperation involving African universities, French =
research institutes, and international organizations. Occurring once =
every two years since its first edition held in 1992 (Yaound=C3=A9, =
Cameroon), CARI is more than a scientific gathering, but a dynamic =
environment for cooperation that brings together African researchers, =
and decision-makers in the fields of computer science and applied =
mathematics. The scientific program, which reflects the wealth and =
diversity of the research carried out on the African continent, places =
special emphasis on work that can contribute to technological =
development, environmental awareness and natural resource management.
=20
CARI 2024 is organized under the auspices of ASDS (African Society in =
Digital Science) in partnership with the Institut National de Recherche =
en Informatique et en Automatique (Inria), the Institut de Recherche =
pour le D=C3=A9veloppement (IRD), the Centre de coop=C3=A9ration =
Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D=C3=A9veloppement =
(CIRAD).
=20
The proceedings will be published as a HAL archive as we did for the =
previous edition (see =
https://universite-paris-saclay.hal.science/CARI2022).
=20
All relevant information on the different stages (and submission =
process) will be available on the CARI website =
(https://www.cari-info.org/).=20
=20
Important dates:
- Opening submission site: December, 2023
- Submission deadline: January 29, 2024=20
- Notification of acceptance: May 15, 2024
- Final version: July 01, 2024
- CARI Conference: November, 2024, Bejaia (Universit=C3=A9 de B=C3=A9jaia =
- LaMOS), Algeria
=20
Submitted papers have to be original works of their authors, which =
moreover are not simultaneously submitted to another conference or =
journal. CARI accepts papers written in either French or English but =
strongly encourages authors to write in English. The submitted papers =
are in PDF and they should conform the template given on CARI website.  =
The limit length of papers is 8 pages to which annexes of a maximal =
length of 4 pages can be added. These annexes will also be published in =
the proceedings.
=20
During the selection of papers to CARI conference we will also select =
some best papers to be included in a special issue of ARIMA journal.
The limit length of papers does not apply to those selected for the =
special issue. These papers will be quickly reviewed by the Programme =
Committee before final acceptance for publication in the journal.

CARI 2024 welcomes and encourages the presentation of methodological =
contributions in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. CARI 2024 =
will provide a forum for students and academic/industrial researchers in =
order to discuss the most recent trends in Computer Science and Applied =
Mathematics and share innovative research directions for Africa. The =
CARI conference encourages to submit original and unpublished research =
work. Contributions covering theoretical developments or applications =
dedicated to African issues are invited.  The papers accepted to CARI =
2024 will be divided into two tracks (Computer Science and Applied =
Mathematics) whose topics of interest include but are not limited to the =
following respective lists:
