DUE TO MANY REQUESTS THE PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE OF VIEW2007 HAS BEEN EXT=
ENDED TO JULY, 13 2007    !!!!

VIEW2007 2nd Visual Information Expert Workshop=20
Hungary, December 3-4, 2007
http://www.view2007.eu
Technical sponsor: IEEE EMBS
Papers of the conference will be published by Springer (LNCS)
Invited Speaker: Alfred Inselberg, Tel Aviv University, Israel.

VIEW 2007 is the second edition of a successful workshop that brought toget=
her researchers from all around the world working on pixelization methods.
These methods associate an information entity with a single pixel so that a=
 set of information entities can be translated to an image.
=20
GOALS
The first Visual Information Expert Workshop defined the basis of the pixel=
ization paradigm. This year, the workshop is aiming at consolidating this b=
asis and at exploring the ways open by the first workshop.
Moreover, in order to make pixelization methods known to non pixelization s=
pecialists , the workshop is also open to all  other 2D information visuali=
zation methods.

TOPICS
The workshop encourages submissions on all topics related to pixelization a=
nd non-pixelization 2D visualization methods, including (but not limited to=
) the following:
* Mathematics, Discrete Geometry and Statistics
* Information sciences: Computer sciences, Data mining, Web sciences, Netwo=
rks
* Physics
* Medicine and biology (genomic, proteomic...)
* Economics, Management
* Psychology, Neuro-Cognitive sciences, Sociology
* Engineering
* Geography, Demography

IMPORTANT DATES
* Papers: July 13, 2007.=20
* Notifications: August 17, 2007.=20
* Camera ready copy: September 5, 2007.

PAPER SUBMISSION
The workshop language is English, both for papers and presentations. Author=
s are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not =
being considered for publication in any other place.
