 Workshop on


INCREMENTAL CLASSIFICATION, CONCEPT DRIFT AND NOVELTY DETECTION (IClaNov)

[http://perso.rd.francetelecom.fr/lemaire/ICDM2013/]

In conjunction with

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING (ICDM 2013, Dallas, Texas / Decembe=
r 7-11, 2013) [http://icdm2013.rutgers.edu/]





Description:

The development of dynamic information analysis methods, like incremental c=
lustering, concept drift management and novelty detection techniques, is be=
coming a central concern in a bunch of applications whose main goal is to d=
eal with information which is varying over time.

These applications relate themselves to very various and highly strategic d=
omains, including web mining, social network analysis, adaptive information=
 retrieval, anomaly or intrusion detection, process control and management,=
 recommender systems, technological and scientific survey, and even genomic=
 information analysis in bioinformatics.

The term =93incremental=94 is often associated to the terms dynamics, adapt=
ive, interactive, on-line, or batch.

The majority of the learning methods were initially defined in a non increm=
ental way. However, in each of these families, were initiated incremental m=
ethods making it possible to take into account the temporal component of a =
datastream.

In a more general way incremental clustering algorithms and novelty detecti=
on approaches are subjected to the following constraints:

- Possibility to be applied without knowing as a preliminary all the data t=
o be analyzed;

- Taking into account of a new data must be carried out without making inte=
nsive use of the already considered data;

- Result must but available after insertion of all new data;

- Potential changes in the data description space must be taken into consid=
eration;

- Independency of order of data arrival.



This workshop aims to offer a meeting opportunity for academics and industr=
y-related researchers, belonging to the various communities of Computationa=
l Intelligence, Machine Learning, Experimental Design and Data Mining to di=
scuss new areas of incremental clustering, concept drift management and nov=
elty detection and on their application to analysis of time varying informa=
tion of various natures. Another important aim of the workshop is to bridge=
 the gap between data acquisition or experimentation and model building.







The set of proposed incremental techniques includes, but is not limited to:



- Novelty and drift detection algorithms and techniques

- Adaptive hierarchical, k-means or density based methods

- Adaptive neural methods and associated Hebbian learning techniques

- Multiview diachronic approaches

- Probabilistic approaches like LDA or ICA-based approaches

- Graph partitioning methods and incremental clustering approaches based on=
 attributed graphs

- Incremental clustering approaches based on swarm intelligence and genetic=
 algorithms

- Evolving classifier ensemble techniques

- Dynamic features selection techniques

- Object tracking techniques

- Visualization methods for evolving data analysis results



The list of application domain is includes, but it is not limited to:



- Evolving textual information analysis

- Evolving social network analysis

- Dynamic process control and tracking

- Dynamic scene analysis

- Intrusion and anomaly detection

- Genomics and DNA microarray data analysis

- Adaptive recommender and filtering systems

- Scientometrics, webometrics and technological survey



All accepted workshop papers will be published in formal proceedings by the=
 IEEE Computer Society Press.
