Call For Participation
WWW'12 Workshop on Mining Social Network Dynamics
In conjunction with World Wide Web (WWW=9212) Conference
(http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/msnd)
16 April 2012
Lyon, France
*********************************************************************
Mining Social Network Dynamics Workshop (MSND) aims at gathering=20=20
researchers from the fields of social computing, machine learning, and=20=20
data mining to think about the obstacles that hurdle the leveraging of=20=20
understanding and capturing of social network dynamics. We target=20=20
researchers from both industry and academia to join forces in this=20=20
exciting area. We intend to discuss the recent and significant=20=20
developments in the general area of mining social network dynamics and=20=20
to promote cross-fertilization of techniques. In particular, we aim at=20=20
identifying techniques from the data mining and machine learning=20=20
fields that will enable researchers to understand the dynamic=20=20
phenomena in social networks and social media, as well as specify=20=20
important directions for the research communities. Understanding,=20=20
capturing, mining and being able to predict dynamic behaviors is=20=20
interesting for several areas such as marketing, security, and Web=20=20
search.

Exciting news: MSND will include a special session around social=20=20
networks for journalism. This session was initially planned and=20=20
organized at SMANE 2012. Our workshop will receive in the same=20=20
occasion 4 papers for presentation coming from the same workshop.=20=20
Please see the program below for more details.

Abstract of the keynote speaker:
Influence and Homophily in Networked User Behavior. Eytan Bakshy=20=20
(Facebook)
Social networks act as pathways for information diffusion, but to what=20=20
extent does social information affect individual sharing decisions? We=20=20
conduct field experiments that randomize the number of social signals=20=20
(cues) that users receive about content.  This design allows us to=20=20
rigorously evaluate how social signals influence sharing behavior,=20=20
above and beyond correlations that arise from homophily. We find that=20=20
the number of sharing friends an individual has, and the strength of=20=20
ties with those friends, is a significant predictor of whether an=20=20
individual shares content, even when no social information is=20=20
displayed. In addition, the number of friends shown has a significant=20=20
but relatively modest increase in the likelihood of sharing compared=20=20
to the baseline condition in which no friends are displayed. Our work=20=20
highlights how both practitioners and researchers alike can benefit=20=20
from more explicit causal models of user behavior in networks.
