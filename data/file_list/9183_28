Extension of submission deadline

5th International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDIâ€™2015)
September 26-28, 2015, Rhodes Island, Greece

http://delab.csd.auth.gr/medi2015/
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the 
dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction 
and collaboration between the models and data research communities. This 
international scientific event, initiated by researchers from 
Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of 
north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges. 
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished work that is not 
currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

Invited Speaker
Christian Jensen, Aalborg University, Denmark
Oscar Pastor Lopez, Polytechnical University of Valencia, Spain

General Chairs
Yamine Ait Ameur, ENSEEIHT/IRIT, France
Athena Vakali, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece

Program Committee Chairs
Yannis Manolopoulos, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece
Ladjel Bellatreche, University of Poitiers, France

Proceedings
Springer Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer Science

Special issues
International Journal of Intelligent Information and Database Systems
International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer

Venue
Set against the historic backdrop of Rhodes Island is the elegant and 
picturesque low-rise architecture of Aldemar Amalia Mare, an 
all-inclusive seaside resort.
