---------------------------------------------------------------------
The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the 
dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction 
and collaboration between the models and data research communities. This 
international scientific event, initiated by researchers from 
Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of 
north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges. 
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished work that is not 
currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.
