========================================================================

The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining series (ICDM) has
established itself as the world's premier research conference in data
mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of
original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of
innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers
all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and
systems, and applications. In addition, ICDM draws researchers and
application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas
such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases
and data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and
high performance computing. By promoting novel, high quality research
findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining
problems, the conference seeks to continuously advance the
state-of-the-art in data mining. Besides the technical program, the
conference will feature workshops, tutorials, panels and, new for this
year, the ICDM data mining contest.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Topics of Interest
---------------------------------------------------------------

Topics related to the design, analysis, and implementation of data
mining applications are of interest. These include, but are not
limited to:

Data mining foundations
  * Novel data mining algorithms in traditional areas (such as
    classification, regression, clustering, probabilistic modeling,
    and association analysis)
  * Algorithms for new, structured, data types, such as arising in
    chemistry, biology, environment, and other scientific domains
  * Developing a unifying theory of data mining
  * Mining sequences and sequential data
  * Mining spatial and temporal datasets
  * Mining textual and unstructured datasets
  * High performance implementations of data mining algorithms

Mining in targeted application contexts
  * Mining high speed data streams
  * Mining sensor data
  * Distributed data mining and mining multi-agent data
  * Mining in networked settings: web, social and computer networks,
    and online communities
  * Data mining in electronic commerce, such as recommendation,
    sponsored web search, advertising, and marketing tasks

Methodological aspects and the KDD process
  * Data pre-processing, data reduction, feature selection, and
    feature transformation
  * Quality assessment, interestingness analysis, and post-processing
  * Statistical foundations for robust and scalable data mining
  * Handling imbalanced data
  * Automating the mining process and other process related issues
  * Dealing with cost sensitive data and loss models
  * Human-machine interaction and visual data mining
  * Security, privacy, and data integrity

Integrated KDD applications and systems

  * Bioinformatics, computational chemistry, geoinformatics, and other
    science & engineering disciplines
  * Computational finance, online trading, and analysis of markets
  * Intrusion detection, fraud prevention, and surveillance
  * Healthcare, epidemic modeling, and clinical research
  * Customer relationship management
  * Telecommunications, network and systems management

---------------------------------------------------------------
Paper Submissions
---------------------------------------------------------------

High quality papers in all data mining areas are solicited. Original
papers exploring new directions will receive especially careful
consideration. Papers that have already been accepted or are currently
under review for other conferences or journals will not be considered
for ICDM '07.

Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages in the
IEEE 2-column format, the same as the camera-ready format (see the
IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines at
<http://www.computer.org/portal/pages/cscps/cps/final/icdm06.xml>http://www.computer.org/portal/pages/cscps/cps/final/icdm06.xml).
All papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of
technical quality, relevance to data mining, originality,
significance, and clarity. Starting this year, a double blind review
process will be adopted. Authors should avoid using identifying
information in the text of the paper. Please use the Submission Form
on the ICDM '07 website to submit your paper.  Accepted papers will be
published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society
Press.

All accepted papers will be published in the ICDM'07 proceedings and
accorded oral presentation times in the main conference. Submissions
accepted as regular papers will be allocated 10 pages in the
proceedings.  Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 6
pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at
the conference than regular papers.

A selected number of IEEE ICDM '07 accepted papers will be invited for
possible inclusion, in expanded and revised form, in the Knowledge and
Information Systems journal
(<http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~kais/>http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~kais/) published
by Springer-Verlag.

---------------------------------------------------------------
ICDM Best Paper Awards
---------------------------------------------------------------

IEEE ICDM Best Paper Awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application
paper. Strong, foundational, results will be considered for the best
research paper award and application-oriented submissions will be
considered for the best application paper award.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Workshops
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the main conference technical program, ICDM will continue
its tradition of hosting workshops that focus on new research
directions and initiatives. All accepted workshop papers will be
included in a separate workshop proceedings published by the IEEE
Computer Society Press.

Please see the ICDM'07 website for solicitations for workshop
proposals.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorials
---------------------------------------------------------------

ICDM will host tutorials covering topics in data mining of interest to
the research community as well as application developers.  Both short
(2 hours) and long (half day) tutorials will be considered.  The
tutorials will be part of the main conference technical program.

Please see the ICDM'07 website for solicitations for tutorial
proposals.
