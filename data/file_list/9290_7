====================

*** The 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social
Network Analysis and Mining ***

Paris, France, August 25-28, 2015http://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2015/

====================================

Dear Colleague,

The study of social networks originated in social and business
communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced
significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social
Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the
online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging
systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine
learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social
medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences
and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution.
This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics,
homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known
entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which
actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.

The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis
and Mining (ASONAM 2015) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary
venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a
variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas
and practices. ASONAM 2015 is intended to address important aspects
with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs
associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference
solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis
and mining along with their application to real life situations.

Papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a
"Best Paper Award" ceremony will be organized at the banquet.

Keynote speakers:

1. Sinan Aral
