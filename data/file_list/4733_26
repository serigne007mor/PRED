[http://toth.condillac.org/conference]

The aim of the Satellite =E2=80=98Terminology and Text Mining=E2=80=99 =
(TTM=E2=80=992020) Session, open to the different TOTh communities, is =
to discuss the advantages and limits of text mining approaches in =
research which include terminological resources in relation to domains =
and applications. This Satellite Session will present and discuss text =
mining approaches used to build and update terminologies, lexica, =
dictionaries, ontologies and thesauri. It will show how these =
terminology-driven approaches can be relevant for dedicated tasks =
(automatic processing of mono- and multilingual content, information =
retrieval, classification, information extraction, named entity =
identification, disambiguation, etc.). The TTM-TOTh=E2=80=992020 Session =
aims to include a wide range of specialists including linguists, =
computer scientists and NLP experts.
