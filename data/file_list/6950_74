5th International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI’2015)
September 26-28, 2015, Rhodes Island, Greece

http://delab.csd.auth.gr/medi2015/
---------------------------------------------------------------------


The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges. Authors are invited to submit original unpublished work that is not currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

*Invited Speaker
Christian Jensen, Aalborg University, Denmark
Oscar Pastor, Polytechnical University of Valencia, Spain
*
General Chairs
Yamine Ait Ameur, ENSEEIHT/IRIT, France
Athena Vakali, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece

Program Committee Chairs
Yannis Manolopoulos, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece
Ladjel Bellatreche, ISAE-ENSMA, France

Proceedings
Springer Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer Science

Special issues
*International Journal of Intelligent Information and Database Systems
