ICFCA 2019 is happy to announce a workshop on "Applications and Tools of =
Formal Concept Analysis".

This workshop seeks to bring together researchers that have developed =
tools for FCA or interesting applications based on different FCA =
algorithms. Its aim is to help the FCA community get an overview and to =
help researchers understand how to use the existing tools.=20
Nowadays, although there are a number of implementations available, many =
researchers implement their own solutions instead of taking advantage of =
the existing ones. Reasons behind this are multiple: needing a new =
feature or a slight modification of an existing feature (for example a =
different input type), not fully understanding what the tool comprises =
of, the lack of documentation, etc.=20
We hope that this workshop can bridge the gap between existing tools and =
possible users.=20
Therefore, both categories would benefit from it: on one hand authors =
will get useful feedback for improving and further developing the tool, =
on the other hand the audience will get a better understanding of the =
tools and can easily start using the tools in their future research.
The contributions to the workshop should concentrate on how to use the =
implemented features and it can be a form of user manual for the tool.=20=



We invite researchers to submit a short paper of 2-4 pages describing =
the tool.=20
Papers submitted to this special session must follow the author =
guidelines for ICFCA.=20
Please send your submissions to the following e-mail address: =
chairICFCA19@gmail.com.=20
All the accepted workshop papers will be published in the Supplementary =
Proceedings of the conference (with ISBN).
We encourage all researchers that have developed such applications to =
submit a paper and present the tool at the workshop, even if the tool =
has already been described in a previous paper.=20

Accepted workshop papers must be presented at the conference, therefore =
at least one author per paper has to register timely.=20

IMPORTANT DATES:
Submission of abstracts: Feb 25, 2019

Submission of full papers: March 1, 2019

Notification of acceptance: Mar 16, 2019

Camera ready copies due: Apr 10, 2019
