Postdoc position in Paris , France: Deep learning for multivariate and 
heterogeneous time series.

The machine learning group at University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) in 
Paris, is looking for a highly motivated postdoc on the topic “Deep 
learning for multivariate and heterogeneous time series”.

This work is part of a EU-RFCS project “Predictive Sensor Data Mining 
for Product Quality Improvement” (PRESED). The general goal of the 
PRESED project is the improvement of quality of steel production plants 
by the online analysis of multiple sensor data. The sensors provide 
complex multivariate and heterogeneous time series covering the whole 
production chain. The objective of the postdoc is the development of new 
statistical methodologies based on deep learning and representation 
learning for the analysis of such time series. This topic offers a 
unique opportunity to explore and extend the field of deep learning on 
complex temporal data and will be conducted in close collaboration with 
ArcelorMittal Global R&D (coordinator of the European project).

The successful candidate will have a strong background in machine 
learning, applied statistics or related fields. He should also have an 
experience in large size experimental data analysis. Preference will be 
given to candidates with sufficient programming skills.

The appointment is initially for one year (extendable depending on work 
progress), between july and september 2015. Gross annual salary is in 
the range  30, 000 – 35, 000 euros.

UPMC is in the center of Paris and is one of the foremost scientific 
universities in France. The position is opened at the Machine Learning 
and Information Access (MLIA) team, whose core research is machine 
learning with applications in semantic (text and image) data analysis. 
The team is composed of 3 professors and 3 assistant professors plus 
around 10 PhDs and Postdocs.

Candidates should send a CV and an accompanying letter to 
patrick.gallinari@lip6.fr <mailto:patrick.gallinari@lip6.fr>.
