bringing
together researchers and practitioners who are interested in e-Business
technology and its current applications. The scope of the conference =

things and web services, but also higher-level issues, such as business
processes, business intelligence, value setting and business strategy.
Furthermore, it covers different approaches to address these issues and
different possible applications with their own specific needs and
requirements on technology. These are all areas of theoretical and =
practical
importance within the broad scope of e-Business, whose growing =
importance
can be seen from the increasing interest of the IT research community.

=20

The conference will be held in cooperation with the ACM Special Interest
Group on Management Information Systems and will include in its =
technical
program remarkable distinguished speakers, such as Prof. Henderik A. =
Proper
