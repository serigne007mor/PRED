WSTST series of meetings) -----

Technically Sponsored by the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society 
(pending approval)
                                          and
                           in Cooperation with ACM SIGAPP.fr (pending approval)

                                  October 26-30, 2008
                                  Cergy-Pointoise, FRANCE
                      Hosted by the "University of Cergy Pontoise"


Description
-----------
The International Conference on Soft Computing as Transdisciplinary Science and
Technology (CSTST'08) brings together international soft computational
intelligence researchers, developers, practitioners, and users.
The aim of CSTST (previously called WSTST) is to serve as a forum to present
current and future work as well as to exchange research ideas in this field.
CSTST'08 invites authors to submit their original and unpublished work that
demonstrates current research in all areas of soft computing, as well as
proposals
for workshops, industrial presentations, demonstrations, and tutorials.


Topics
-------
We solicit original research and technical papers not published elsewhere.
The papers can be theoretical, practical and application oriented on the
following themes (but not limited to):

* Information and Data Management
* Intelligent Hybrid Systems
* Fusion of Soft and Hard Computing
* Data and Web Mining
* Decision Support Systems
* Natural Language Processing
* Intelligent Agent-based Systems, Cognitive and Reactive Distributed AI Systems
* Internet Modeling
* Multimedia Information Systems
* Information Retrieval
* Human-Computer Interface
* XML-based Languages
* Security and Access Control
* Information Content Security
* Mobile, Ad Hoc and Sensor Network Management
* Applications

	o E-Learning, eCommerce, eBusiness and eGovernment
	o Image and speech signal processing, prediction, and control
	o Robotics
	o Biology and medicine
	o Business and management
	o Artificial societies
	o Chemicals, pharmaceuticals and materials
	o Environment engineering


Paper Submission
-----------------
Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF files and should be uploaded
using the conference website (http://cstst.insa-lyon.fr).
Full paper submissions should be in ACM format with a limit of 6 pages.
Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 independent reviewers of the PC.

Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originality,
technical soundness, and quality of presentation.
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging
positions on important emergent topics.
At least one author should attend the conference to present the paper.


Workshop/tutorial Submission
-----------------------------
A workshop/tutorial proposal must be about 2--5 pages long and contain the
following information:

  * Title;
  * Summary;
  * Topics;
  * Format and duration;
  * Organizers (attach short CVs, limit of 2 pages each);
  * Proposed program committee (workshops only);
  * Expected submission and acceptance rate (workshops only);
  * Type (academic and/or industrial) and number of expected participants;
  * Significance in relation to topics of the main conference and details of any
previous workshops.


Proceedings of all CSTST'08 workshops are to be published as a single volume to
be distributed at the conference.
All the workshop papers should be limited to 6 pages in ACM format.

Workshop/tutorial proposals are reviewed based on the quality of the proposal,
its relation to the main conference topics,
and the likelihood to attract enough participants.

Proposals must be sent by email to rchbeir@u-bourgogne.fr
