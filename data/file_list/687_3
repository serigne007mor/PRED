CALL FOR PAPERS
ECAI'2006 Workshop on Knowledge Management and Organizational Memories

Riva del Garda, Italy, August 28 or 29, 2006
http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/WORKSHOPS/ECAI2006-OM/call.html


Knowledge Management (KM) is one of the key progress factors in
organizations. It aims at capturing explicit and tacit knowledge of an 
organization in order to facilitate the access, sharing, and reuse of 
that knowledge as well as creation of new knowledge and organizational 
learning. KM must be guided by a strategic vision to fulfill its primary 
organizational objectives: improving knowledge sharing and cooperative 
work inside the organization; disseminating best practices; improving 
relationships with the external world; preserving past knowledge of the 
organization for reuse; improving the quality of projects and
innovations; anticipating the evolution of the external environment; and 
preparing for unexpected events and managing urgency and crisis
situations.

One approach for KM consists of building a corporate memory or
organizational memory (OM). Several techniques can be considered, 
according to the type of organization, its needs and its culture: 
knowledge-based approaches, document-based approaches, workflow-based 
approaches, CBR-based approaches, CSCW and cooperative approaches, 
ontology-based approaches, corporate Semantic Webs, Web-based
approaches, agent-based approaches, distributed OMs, etc.

Several scenarios of KM can be tackled through OMs: project memory, 
skills management, communities of practice, strategic or technological 
watch, e-learning, e-government, etc. The workshop aims at gathering 
researchers from multiple disciplines, industrial participants and 
students in order to discuss models, methodologies, techniques and 
application dealing with these scenarios and approaches.


Papers are welcome in any area concerning knowledge management.
Examples of interesting topics are:

SCENARIOS FOR OMs :
• Skill management
• Project memory
• Community memory
• Strategic or technological watch, Business Intelligence
• E-learning
