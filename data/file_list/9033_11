> Machine learning is an emerging and fast changing scientific area that
> is crossing many disciplinary boundaries.  What I often find amazing
> about the community is how diverse it is, drawing inspiration from so
> many sources, and getting applied in, and transforming so many
> different fields.
>
> To help me understand the machine learning community better, and to
> solicit opinions of members of the community with regards the role and
> place of machine learning in relation to other disciplines and in the
> university, I have put together a survey, at:

> I would really appreciate it if you can spend 5-10 minutes completing

> procrastination :)

> This survey is conducted as part of the UCL Post Graduate Certificate
