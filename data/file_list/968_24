OVERVIEW
=========

Internet is a medium allowing services and information exchange in an open and decentralized environment, notably with numerous applications for virtual enterprises. It concerns enterprise information systems, local, regional and governmental organizations but it also involves more and more common users in the so-called web 2.0. The main stake is to use Internet as a technological support to communication, information exchange, service composition personalisation and access by all and anywhere. In this perspective, some work has been done these last years to combine classical techniques of information management with artificial intelligence technologies thus creating a new research domain called Web Intelligence.

Web Intelligence is a multidisciplinary area dealing with exploiting data and services over the Web, to create new data and services using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The link to Networking and Virtual Communities (VCs) is obvious: the web is a set of nodes, providing and consuming data and services; the permanent or temporary ties and exchanges in-between these nodes build the so-called virtual communities; and the ICT and AI techniques contribute to the process and automate (or partly automate) communication and cooperation processes.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
====================

We invite scholars and professionals from a broad range of disciplines
to submit to this Special Issue. Papers may encompass any or all of
the following: foundational theoretical analyses, modelling,
simulation, and empirical studies. Special topics of interest include, but are not limited to,
the following:

* Multi-agent models and tools for VC
* Services and Grid Services for VC, Service oriented architectures
* Web information mining, filtering and retrieval within/for VC
* Web-based applications and plate-forms for VC
* Intelligent web interaction, querying, diffusion
* Semantics and ontology engineering for VC
* Self-* models and techniques for VC
* Social networks modelling, virtual communities, social intelligence
* Context-based approach, profile management, personalization and recommendations for/through VC
* Privacy preserving, security, trust-based computing&  reputation systems
* Applications: E-* (market, procurement, technologies, health, government, etc.) and VC
* VC and content and knowledge repositories, behaviour modelling and exchange
* Web intelligence, mobility and VE, Ambient Intelligence, Pervasive computing
* Performances evaluation, experiments, user feed-back
* Surveys on WI and VC

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
