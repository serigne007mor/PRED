Call for Tutorial Proposals
Due by August 1, 2014

The 14th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (IEEE ICDM 2014) will=
 host short and long tutorials as well as workshops that focus on new resea=
rch directions and initiatives. The tutorials will be part of the main conf=
erence technical program, and are free of charge to the attendees of the co=
nference. Further, the conference provides the following support for each l=
ong/short tutorial: an honorarium of $500 and a complimentary registration =
for one of the tutorial presenters who is not also a presenting author. Tut=
orial presenters will be responsible for covering all their other expenses.

We invite proposals for tutorials from active researchers and experienced t=
utors. Ideally, a tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art research, develo=
pment and applications in a specific data mining direction, and stimulate a=
nd facilitate future work. A tutorial should not only focus on the presente=
r's previous work. Tutorials on interdisciplinary directions, novel and fas=
t growing directions, and significant applications are highly encouraged.

Format of the Submission

A tutorial proposal should be formatted in the following sections:

Content details: An outline of the tutorial in the form of a bulleted list =
with references and estimates for the time that will be devoted to each sub=
ject. (up to 1 page).
Target audience and prerequisites (up to 100 words): From which areas do yo=
u expect potential participants to come? What prior knowledge, if any, do y=

Tutor's short bio and their expertise related to the tutorial (up to 100 wo=
rds per tutor).

uded if a short tutorial is given.
A list of up to 20 most important references that will be covered in the tu=
