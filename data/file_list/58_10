6th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing (ICSOC'08)
Sydney, Australia, December 1-5, 2008

http://icsoc.org/

Abstract submission: June 1, 2008 11:59pm, PST
Paper submission: June 8, 2008 11:59pm, PST
**********************************************************************


CALL FOR PAPERS
--------------------------
Service oriented computing is an emerging cross-disciplinary paradigm 
for distributed computing that is changing the way software applications 
are designed, architected, delivered and consumed.

ICSOC’08 builds on the success of previous conferences in this series, 
establishing bridges between established and new service research and 
applications communities and fostering cross-community scientific 
excellence. Our goal is to bring together ideas and technologies from 
many different fields in an evolutionary manner, to address research 
challenges such as service composition, discovery, integration, 
monitoring and management of services, service quality and security, 
methodologies for supporting service development, governance in their 
evolution, as well as their overall life-cycle management. This year, we 
are focusing on building bridges with the business community because of 
its ongoing contribution to the emerging field of Services Science.

ICSOC’08 seeks original papers in the field of service oriented 
computing, from theoretical and foundational results to empirical 
evaluations as well as practical and industrial experiences, with the 
emphasis on results that contribute to solving the many still open 
research problems that are of significant importance to the field of 
service oriented applications. Topics include but are not limited to the 
following:

- Services Foundations
- Business Service Modelling
- Integrating Systems of Systems using Services
- Service Engineering
- Service Assembly
- Service Management
- SOA Runtime
- Quality of Service
- Service Applications (Grid, E-science, Government, etc.)
- Business and Economical Aspects of Services

DEMONSTRATIONS, WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS and PHD SYMPOSIUM
----------------------------------------------------------
Submissions are also invited for:

- System demonstrations to showcase innovative implementation 
approaches, technologies and tools related to service-oriented computing;
- Workshops to further foster discussion among researchers and 
practitioners working on topics related to service-oriented computing;
- Tutorials to disseminate state-of-the-art knowledge in fields related 
to the topics of the conference;
- PhD Symposium, where PhD candidates will have the opportunity to get 
in touch with experts in their research areas and to obtain early 
feedback on their research results.

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their innovation, 
practical and theoretical value, presentation, and relevance to the main 
conference themes. For further details, specific calls for each of the 
above activities are going to be disseminated through the main mailing 
lists soon; they are also available online on the conference web site.

SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION
--------------------------
Prospective authors must submit an abstract prior to submitting their 
full paper – this abstract will be used in matching reviewers with 
papers. Research papers should describe innovative and significant 
original research relevant to ICSOC as described above. Papers submitted 
for consideration must not have been published elsewhere and must not be 
under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the duration of 
consideration.

All papers must be prepared in accordance with the Springer/LNCS 
camera-ready format and be submitted electronically (in PDF) via the 
conference web site. Research papers are not to exceed 15 pages, 
including all references and figures. All submissions should include 
title, authors, and full contact information. Detailed instructions for 
authors are available on the LNCS website:

http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0&teaserId=45515&CENTER_ID=99829

Submissions should indicate the scientific area that best fits the 
content of the paper. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of 
originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality 
of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. The program 
committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions 
to accept for presentation at the conference.

All accepted papers will appear in the ICSOC’08 proceedings (pending 
request), published by Springer Verlag as a part of its Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science (LNCS) series 
(http://www.springer.com/dal/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=1-164-7-72376-0). 
At least one author of the paper is expected to present the results at 
the ICSOC’08 conference. Selected papers will be invited for a special 
section of STTT (Int. Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer).
