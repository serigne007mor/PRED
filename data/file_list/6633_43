IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
Paper Submission: February 4, 2014
Decision Notification: March 14, 2014
Camera-Ready Submission : April 11, 2014

Nowadays we are witnessing the democratization of Internet
services. As a result, more and more end-users (individuals and
businesses) are adopting the concept of Software-as-a-Service for
achieving their transactions (shopping, administrative procedures, B2B
transactions, etc.). In such scenarios, personal data is generally
transferred among several entities, therefore end-users need to (i) be
aware of the collection, processing, storage and retention of personal
data and (ii) to have necessary means to hold service providers
accountable for the usage of their data. Dealing with personal data
raises several issues that must be considered in the creation and use
of novel Cloud services. Accountability, privacy and data protection
gained more interest recently with the ongoing European Data
Protection Regulation Reform and the NSA privacy violation scandal in
the US.

Accountability is the property of a service of being responsible for
its actions according to the data stewardship regime in which
organizations that are entrusted with personal and business
confidential data. This includes, among others, the obligations manage
user consent, to report security breaches when they occur, to provide
evidence data processing practices, etc. Such concerns need to be part
of software or cloud services from their design to implementation, but
also of their discovery, composition, execution, and auditing.

The goal of this track is to offer academic and industrial researchers
and practitioners a platform for discussions related to privacy and
accountability issues in software components and cloud services.

TOPICS=20
------=20
We target contributions from both academia and
industrials on the following topics, but not limited to:
- Accountability and data protection in the cloud
- Privacy and Trust for the Cloud

- Accountability/Privacy in Web and cloud services
- Accountability/Privacy policy description frameworks
- Accountability/Privacy aware software development and design
- Accountability/Privacy aware software composition and mashup
- Auditing of cloud services
- Accountability evidences
- Use cases and real world development and experiences
- Tools and frameworks for accountability
