CFP: Special session on Multiplex Network Mining@CASoN=922014
30 July, 1 August 2014, Porto Portugal

Submission deadline : 15 May 2014
web site : http://lipn.fr/mnm14
submission site : https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcason2014
____________________________________________________________________________

Context
Complex networks used to model interactions in real-world phenomena are oft=
en heterogeneous network with different types of nodes and edges. Focusing =
on a single type of nodes, a complex network would be better described by a=
 multiplex: a set of nodes related to each other with different types of re=
lations. This representation is much richer than simple complex networks of=
ten used to model complex interaction systems. However, this poses the chal=
lenge to provide adequate answers to all basic network analysis tasks that =
have been studied and provided in the recent few years for the case of homo=
geneous networks. This include for instance: the problem of node ranking (c=
omputing nodes centralities), community detection, link prediction, informa=
tion diffusion models and network visualization. Almost all work in the fie=
ld of multiplex network analysis are based on transforming the problem, in =
a way or another to the classical case of homogeneous network analysis.
Existing approaches include: layer aggregation based approaches or applying=
 ensemble methods on results obtained on each layer aside. Little work has =
focused on analyzing all layers at once. The goal of this session is to mak=
e the point on new approaches for multiplex network analysis and mining.

Topics

A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics include:

Models & measures for multiplex networks
       Centrality in multiplex networks
       Paths, clustering coefficient in multiplex networks
       Random walks on multiplex networks
       Co-evolution of layers in multiplex networks.
       Layer aggregation approaches.
       Vertex similarity in multiplex network
Community detection in multiplex network
       Multiplex network partitioning
       Multi-layer modularity functions
       Overlapping community detection
Dynamic & multiplex networks
       Link prediction in multiplex network
       Missing links detection
       Multiplex network evolution models
       Dynamic networks as a multiplex=20
Machine learning approaches=20=20
       Ensemble learning for multiplex network mining
       Multi-view clustering
       Collaboratif learning
Applications=20
       Recommender systems
       Heterogeneous network mining
       Reality mining
       Mobility data mining
       Networks of networks analysis

Submitted papers should be original and contain contributions of theoretica=
l, experimental or application nature, or be unique experience reports.

The page limit for a full-length paper is 6 pages. Short papers describing =
novel research visions, work-in-progress or less mature results a re also w=
elcome, with a minimum limit of 4 pages. All submissions should be in the I=
EEE 8.5 two-column format.=20

Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and soundn=
ess, and will be reviewed by at least three independent reviewers. The conf=
erence proceedings will be distributed amongst the participants during the =
conference. Accepted papers must be presented by author(s) personally to be=
 published in the conference proceedings.
