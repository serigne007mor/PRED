Bonjour,

Dans le cadre de son partenariat avec le RMIT de Melbourne, l'=E9cole Epite=
ch
et l'ACSEL (Advanced Computer Science Epitech Laboratory) vous
propose deux s=E9minaires :

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
Le Lundi 6 Avril 2009 - Andrew Turpin : How do Search Engines Work?

Epitech, 24, rue Pasteur 94270 Le Kremlin Bic=EAtre
Metro porte d'italie

R=E9sum=E9 :

We have all become very accustomed to using search engines like Google, but
how is it possible to find 10 pages
amongst 80 million Web pages in less than a second?
This talk will give an overview of the algorithms and data structures used
to make a search engines work,
and then focus on the work of one of our PhD students on the algorithms for
generating short summaries of returned pages: snippets.

A propos de l'auteur :

Associate Professor Andrew Turpin is Head of the Information Storage,
Analysis and Retrieval Discipline at the School of Computer Science and
Information Technology,
RMIT University, Melbourne Australia, and an ARC Queen Elizabeth II Research
Fellow. He completed his PhD at The University of Melbourne
on data compression in 1999, subsequently spent several years at Devers Eye
Institute and Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland Oregon,
then four more years after that teaching computer science at Curtin
University of Technology in Perth. After a short time as Senior Lecturer at
The University of Melbourne,
he has spent the last 4.5 years at RMIT as part of The Search Engine Group.
His recent research interests are in evaluating information retrieval
engines,
algorithms for pattern searching, and computational methods for diagnosing
and monitoring glaucoma.

Le jeudi 16 Avril 2009 =E0 19h - James Thom : User evaluation studies for
information retrieval and database research

Epitech, 24, rue Pasteur 94270 Le Kremlin Bic=EAtre
Metro porte d'italie

R=E9sum=E9 :

The Cranfield methodology is the basis for the evaluation of many major
international collaborative retrieval experiments (such as TREC, TRECVID,
INEX, and CLEF), and requires user assessments on the relevance of answers
returned by retrieval systems. In this talk I will present user evaluation
studies in three quite different contexts: database schema matching,
filtering of search engine results, and mediated enterprise search.
In the first study, users identify matches between pairs of database
schemas to support the evaluation of the effectiveness of using a Star
ontology to represent schemas in data warehouse. The user study on
filtering of educational resources shows that assessment criteria other
than relevance can be valuable in specialized retrieval environments.
The user study on enterprise search quantifies the cost and benefit to an
information service provider of investing in mediated enterprise search.

A propos de l'auteur :

James Thom is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science and
IT, at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. He received his PhD from
the University of Melbourne in 1993, with a thesis in the area of document
database systems. His research interests encompass mostly databases and
information retrieval, and he has published 75 refereed papers in journals
and conferences, including publications in ACM Transactions on Database
Systems, ACM Transactions on the Web, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and
Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, Journal of the American
Society for Information Science, Information Processing and Management, and
Information Retrieval.
