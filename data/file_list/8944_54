The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has established its=
elf as the world's premier research conference in data mining. We invite hi=
gh-quality papers reporting original research on all aspects of data mining=
, including applications, algorithms, software, and systems. We especially =
encourage submissions that promote the advancement of data mining as a scie=
ntific and engineering discipline and submissions that bridge different dis=
ciplines with data mining, such as statistics, machine learning, pattern re=
cognition, databases, data warehousing, visualization, knowledge-based syst=
ems, and high-performance computing. Papers are rigorously evaluated based =
on novelty, technical merit, significance, clarity, relevance, and repeatab=
ility. Papers submitted should be original work, not previously published o=
r currently reviewed in a peer-reviewed conference or journal.=20
Topics of Interest=20

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:=20

Foundations, algorithms, models, and theory of data mining=20
Machine learning and statistical methods for data mining=20
Mining text, semi-structured, spatio-temporal, streaming, graph, web, multi=
media data=20
Data mining systems and platforms, their efficiency, scalability, and priva=
cy=20
Data mining in modeling, visualization, personalization, and recommendation=
=20
Applications of data mining in all domains including social, web, bioinform=
atics, and finance=20

Submission Guidelines=20

Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in the =
IEEE 2-column format (see the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Autho=
r Guidelines). All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program=
 Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to data mining, ori=
ginality, significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations must not=
 appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted t=
o preserve author anonymity. Accepted papers will be published in the confe=
rence proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press.=20
Repeatability=20

Every effort should be made to enable the code and the datasets (or their c=
losest publicly available equivalents) and all relevant parameter specifica=
tions available to reviewers and readers so that the results can be indepen=
dently replicated. To retain anonymity of submissions, any such additional =
material should be anonymized as well, and be published on an anonymous web=
site (such as DropBox).=20
Best Paper Awards=20

Awards will be conferred at the conference on the authors of the best resea=
rch paper, the best application paper, and the best student paper. A select=
ed number of accepted papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in an =
expanded and revised form, in the Knowledge and Information Systems journal=
 published by Springer-Verlag.=20
Important Dates=20

Paper submission: June 24, 2014=20
Acceptance notification: September 24, 2014=20
Conference dates: December 14-17, 2014=20
