                    Eighth International Symposium

                                 on

             Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems

                           (FoIKS 2014)

                  Bordeaux, France -- March 3-7, 2014

                       http://2014.foiks.org/


The FoIKS symposia provide a biennial forum for presenting and 
discussing theoretical and applied research on information and knowledge 
systems. The goal is to bring together researchers with an interest in 
this subject, share research experiences, promote collaboration and 
identify new issues and directions for future research.

FoIKS 2014 solicits original contributions dealing with any foundational 
aspect of information and knowledge systems. This includes submissions 
that apply ideas, theories or methods from specific disciplines to 
information and knowledge systems. Examples of such disciplines are 
discrete mathematics, logic and algebra, model theory, information 
theory, complexity theory, algorithmics and computation, statistics and 
optimisation.

Previous FoIKS symposia were held in Kiel (Germany) in 2012, Sofia 
(Bulgaria) in 2010, Pisa (Italy) in 2008, Budapest (Hungary) in 2006, 
Vienna (Austria) in 2004, Schlo\ss\ Salzau near Kiel (Germany) in 2002, 
and Burg/Spreewald near Berlin (Germany) in 2000. FoIKS took up the 
tradition of the conference series Mathematical Fundamentals of Database 
Systems (MFDBS), which initiated East-West collaboration in the field of 
database theory. Former MFDBS conferences were held in Rostock (Germany) 
in 1991, Visegrad (Hungary) in 1989, and Dresden (Germany) in 1987.

The FoIKS symposia are a forum for intense discussions. Speakers will be 
given sufficient time to present their ideas and results within the 
larger context of their research. Furthermore, participants will be 
asked to prepare a first response to another contribution in order to 
initiate discussion.

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

* Database Design: formal models, dependencies and independencies;
* Dynamics of Information: models of transactions, concurrency control, 
updates, consistency preservation, belief revision;
* Information Fusion: heterogeneity, views, schema dominance, multiple 
source information merging, reasoning under inconsistency;
* Integrity and Constraint Management: verification, validation, 
consistent query answering, information cleaning;
* Intelligent Agents: multi-agent systems, autonomous agents, 
foundations of software agents, cooperative agents, formal models of 
interactions, logical models of emotions;
* Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval: machine learning, data 
mining, formal concept analysis and association rules, text mining, 
information extraction;
* Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Planning: non-monotonic 
formalisms, probabilistic and non-probabilistic models of uncertainty, 
graphical models and independence, similarity-based reasoning, 
preference modeling and handling, argumentation systems;
* Logics in Databases and AI: classical and non-classical logics, logic 
programming, description logic, spatial and temporal logics, probability 
logic, fuzzy logic;
* Mathematical Foundations: discrete structures and algorithms, graphs, 
grammars, automata, abstract machines, finite model theory, information 
theory, coding theory, complexity theory, randomness;
* Security in Information and Knowledge Systems: identity theft, 
privacy, trust, intrusion detection, access control, inference control, 
secure Web services, secure Semantic Web, risk management;
* Semi-Structured Data and XML: data modelling, data processing, data 
compression, data exchange;
* Social Computing: collective intelligence and self-organizing 
knowledge, collaborative filtering, computational social choice, Boolean 
games, coalition formation, reputation systems;
* The Semantic Web and Knowledge Management: languages, ontologies, 
agents, adaption, intelligent algorithms; and
* The WWW: models of Web databases, Web dynamics, Web services, Web 
transactions and negotiations.


PUBLICATION

The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science. After the symposium, authors of selected 
papers will be asked to prepare extended versions of their papers for 
publication in a special issue of the journal Annals of Mathematics and 
Artificial Intelligence.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Papers must be typeset using the Springer LaTeX2e style llncs for 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (see 
http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html). The suggested number of 
pages is 16, and the maximum number of pages is 18. Submissions which 
deviate substantially from these guidelines may be rejected without 
review. Initial submissions must be in PDF format, but authors should 
keep in mind that the LaTeX2e source must be submitted for the final 
versions of accepted papers. Submissions in alternate formats, such as 
Microsoft Word, cannot be accepted for either initial or final versions. 
The submissions will be judged for scientific quality and for 
suitability as a basis for broader discussion. Submission is via 
EasyChair at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foiks2014.


IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission deadline:  September 30, 2013
Paper submission deadline:     October 06, 2013
Author notification:           November 17, 2013
