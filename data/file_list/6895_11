**EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE**

Call for Papers and Extended Abstracts
DevLeaNN: A Workshop on Development and Learning in Artificial Neural
Networks
October 27 and 28, in Paris, France
http://devleann.iscpif.fr

DevLeaNN is a two-day workshop devoted to showcasing the current
state-of-the-art at the intersection of development and learning in
artificial neural network design. The purpose of DevLeaNN is to gather
researchers from related streams of research to present both novel research
and summaries of research portfolios.

Topics include, but are not limited to:
* constructive or pruning techniques / network ensembles
* neural Darwinism
* neuro-evolutionary techniques
* reservoir computing (Echo State Networks, Liquid State Machines)
* deep neural networks
* artificial development / artificial embryogeny / generative and
developmental techniques
* genotype-to-phenotype mappings
* temporal / spatial development
* artificial genetic regulatory networks
* neuromodulation
* plasticity
* knowledge representation / population coding
* topological optimization

We are soliciting papers and extended abstracts. Both novel research and
summaries of existing research portfolios are welcome.

We are presently negotiating a published proceedings of extended versions of
submissions with Springer's Studies in Computational Intelligence Series.

WORKSHOP DATE AND VENUE:
October 27-28, 2011
Institut des syst=E8mes complexes, Paris, France

IMPORTANT DATES:
* Paper/Extended Abstract Submission: Friday 23 September, 2011
* Paper/Extended Abstract Notification: Wednesday 05 October, 2011
* Workshop: Thursday 27 and Friday 28 October, 2011
(To accommodate time-conscious travellers, submissions received by the old
deadline, 9 September, will be notified by 23 September)

INVITED SPEAKERS:
* Hugues Berry (Universit=E9 de Lyon)
* Yaochu Jin (University of Surrey)
* Thomas Trappenberg (Dalhousie University)

Thanks for your attention, and we hope to see you in Paris!
