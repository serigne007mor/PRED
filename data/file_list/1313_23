EKAW 2008 - Call for Papers

16th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge 
Management
"Knowledge Patterns"
29th September-3rd October 2008 - Acitrezza, Catania (Italy)
http://ekaw2008.inrialpes.fr

Knowledge is considered as the most important asset in our modern 
society. It has now penetrated all facets of computing practice: from 
the rise of knowledge management to the semantic web and from the blog 
culture to the knowledge economy. This penetration has made proper 
knowledge engineering a most required feature.

The 16th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge 
Management is concerned with all aspects of eliciting, acquiring, 
modelling and managing knowledge, and their role in the construction of 
knowledge-intensive systems and services for the semantic web, knowledge 
management, e-business, natural language processing, intelligent 
integration information, etc.

This year we will also pay special attention to the topic of "knowledge 
patterns" that can be considered as good practices or models that are 
applied or reused throughout the knowledge engineering lifecycle. Hence, 
beyond traditional topics of EKAW, we solicit papers that cover research 
on how to describe, classify, model, extract, and apply knowledge 
patterns in the design of ontologies, applications and products. We 
regard highly the description of experiences that involve the 
application and identification of knowledge patterns in social network 
analysis, natural language processing, multimedia analysis, pattern 
recognition, etc.

EKAW 2008 will also feature a tutorial program, student papers track, 
posters and demos track, and an Industry Panel. The calls for these 
events are separate (except the student track that follows the main 
track deadlines), and can be found on the conference Web site.

Conference Topics of Interest and Area Keywords

EKAW 2008 welcomes the submission of original research and application 
papers dealing with theoretical, methodological, experimental, and 
application aspects. In particular, but not exclusively, we solicit 
papers about methodologies, models, and tools for the following topics:

ONTOLOGY DESIGN

Ontology design patterns
Collaborative ontology design
Ontology dynamics
Ontology modularization
Ontology evaluation and selection
Automatic ontology construction

NETWORKED ONTOLOGIES

Ontology matching
Web semantics
Semantic social networks
Semantics and Web2.0
Semantics in multimedia technologies
Contextual reasoning

KNOWLEDGE REENGINEERING

Ontology learning
Knowledge-based information extraction
Reengineering conceptual models and schemas
Reengineering folksonomies, lexicons, thesauri
Hybridating Ontology Engineering and NLP techniques

PROCESS KNOWLEDGE AND SEMANTIC SERVICES

Ontologies and agents
Semantic web services
Semantic portals and intrawebs
Semantic mashup
Semantic grid services
Knowledge Services for e-Science
Problem solving methods and semantic web services
Peer to Peer communication between semantic systems
Brokering systems

SOCIAL AND COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING

Human factors in knowledge management
Sustainability and cost analysis of knowledge engineering
Human-ontology interaction
Cognitive systems and knowledge engineering

Important Dates

Abstract Submission: April 14th, 2008
Full Paper Submission: April 21st, 2008
Notification: June 9th, 2008
Camera Ready: June 30th, 2008
Conference: Sept 29 - Oct 3, 2008

Submissions

Paper submission and reviewing for EKAW 2008 will be electronic via the 
conference submissions site. Full papers should not exceed sixteen (16) 
pages in length and must be formatted according to the information for 
LNCS authors. The submission of a short abstract (using the online 
submission facility) will ease the reviewer assignment for research 
papers. Note that submission of posters and demos will only be possible 
from June 10th, 2008.

Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) 
format and will *not* be accepted in any other format. Papers that 
exceed 16 pages or do not follow the LNCS guidelines risk being rejected 
automatically without a review. Authors of accepted papers will be 
required to provide semantic annotations for the abstract of their 
submission -- details of this process will be provided on the conference 
web page at the time of acceptance. At least one author of each accepted 
paper must register for the conference.

Best Paper Award

An award will be given to the best paper (or papers) submitted to the 
conference as judged by the Program Chairs in collaboration with the 
Program Committee. A best student paper award will also be given.
