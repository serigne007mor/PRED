 *** Scope and Topics ***

E-Business is one of most challenging areas for industry and research 
communities. It is evolving from the disparate B2C, B2B and B2G systems 
to the integration and collaboration of business services between 
various information systems and e-marketplaces for integrated services. 
In this evolving process, integrated e-business systems and their 
related supporting platforms have to be rapidly formed and designed in 
order to meet different demands. A number of e-business engineering 
paradigms, IT concepts and technologies have been developed to tackle 
these challenges. However, there are still lots of research issues 
needed to be addressed. These include heterogeneous services 
integration, disparate e-business functions collaboration, and semantic 
level e-business messaging.

 ICEBE 2009 is the 6th conference which is initiated from 2003 by the 
IEEE Technical Committee on E-Commerce. It is a high-quality 
international forum for researchers and practitioners from different 
areas of computer science and information systems to exchange their 
latest findings and experiences, as well as to help shape the future of 
IT-transformed consumers, enterprises, governments and markets. The 
conference scope spans the areas of Web, databases, service science, 
multimedia, information systems and electronic marketplaces. The main 
themes of this year's conference will be "enabling integrated e-business 
systems through servicing and collaboration", which is distributed in 
the following program tracks:

 + Software engineering for e-business

  - Design methods, tools and science for e-business

  - Models, platforms and applications for e-business

  - Components, services and solutions for e-business

  - Aspects of green business and green commerce
