"Rights, Duties and Ethics of Autonomous Agents"
Workshop at PAAMS 2015

June 3rd 2015

University of Salamanca, Spain

https://rda2ethics-2015.greyc.fr/

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The autonomous decision capability embedded in software or robot agents
is one of the major issues of Artificial Intelligence. It is a core
property for AI applications such as e-commerce, serious games, ambient
computing, social or collective robotics, companion robots, unmanned
vehicles. Autonomous agents decide and act in a given context or
environment and under domain constraints, and possibly interact with
other agents or human beings e.g. to share tasks or to execute tasks on
behalf of others.

As machines and agents have more and more autonomous functions and
consequently are less and less supervised by human operators or users,
we need to ensure that they do not harm them or threaten their autonomy,
especially their decision autonomy. Consequently regulation and control
mechanisms to ensure sound and consistent behaviours at the agent=E2=80=99s
individual level, at the multi-agent level, and within the human-agent
system are a major issue. Moreover, the ethical regulation or control of
such autonomous agents has been discussed by several authors. As stated
by Rosalind Picard, the greater the freedom of a machine, the more it
will need moral standards.

Organisation models, conversation policies, normative systems,
constraints, logical frameworks address the problem of how agents=E2=80=99
autonomous behaviours should be controlled, paving the way for formal or
pragmatic definitions of agents=E2=80=99 Rights, Duties and Ethics. The iss=
ue is
all the more important as autonomous agents may encounter new
situations, evolve in open environments, interact with agents based on
different design principles, act on behalf of human beings and share
common resources. For instance: should an autonomous agent take over the
control from a human operator? under which circumstances?

TOPICS OF INTEREST

The aim of this workshop is to promote discussions and exchanges on the
different issues raised by autonomous agents=E2=80=99 Rights, Duties and Et=
hics
and on models that can be proposed to represent and reason on Rights,
Duties and Ethics. Thus, we encourage contributions from the following
research and application areas but also contributions presenting
practical applications of multi-agent systems where ethical issues may
be raised:
=E2=80=A2 Autonomous agents and privacy protection
=E2=80=A2 Learning rights, duties and ethics
=E2=80=A2 Authority sharing between autonomous agents and human users or op=
erators
=E2=80=A2 Rights, duties and ethics of autonomous agents towards other agen=
ts,
users or operators
=E2=80=A2 Rights, duties and ethics of human users or operators towards
autonomous agents
=E2=80=A2 Consistency, conflicts among rights, duties and ethics in multi-a=
gent
and human-agent systems
=E2=80=A2 Mutual intelligibility, explanations
=E2=80=A2 Control of autonomous agents within organisations, institutions,
normative systems
=E2=80=A2 Philosophy, sociology and law in the models of rights, duties and=
 ethics
=E2=80=A2 Trust and reputation for autonomous agents regulation
=E2=80=A2 Emergence and evolution of rights, duties and ethics
=E2=80=A2 Knowledge representation and models for rights, duties and ethics
