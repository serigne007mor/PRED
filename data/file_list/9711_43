The Vision and Content Engineering Lab (LVIC) of CEA LIST (French Atomic 
Commission), an interdisciplinary group that works on multimedia and 
multilingual data analysis and understanding, with a focus on fast 
growing and large public application domains, announces the availability 
of a 2-years post doctoral position.

The position is associated to the MUCKE project, funded within the 
CHIST-ERA funding scheme of the FP7, which fosters highly innovative and 
multidisciplinary collaborative projects in information and 
communication sciences and technologies. The project will start in 
October 2012. Its main objective is to devise new and reliable knowledge 
extraction models designed for multilingual and multimodal data shared 
on social networks.

The post-doctoral researcher will first work on multimodal concept 
representation and then on user credibility estimation for multimedia 
flows. The first task will focus on the proposition of innovative 
language and image processing techniques as well as on their combination 
using information fusion techniques. Particular attention will be given 
to the scalability of the methods developed because one important 
project objective is to model a large number of concepts (hundreds of 
thousands) and an important volume of textual and visual documents (tens 
of millions). For textual documents, the objective is to depart from 
text representations as bags of words (unigrams) to representations as 
vectors of unambiguous concepts and entities through concept and entity 
recognition and disambiguation. For images, the main problems tacked in 
MUCKE are parsimonious local image description, large scale concept 
detection and concept visualness. Multimodal fusion will be based on 
probabilistic models that move beyond a scoring of similarity towards 
providing an actual probability of relevance.

The second task will focus on the proposition of a novel model for 
estimating user credibility for multimedia flows, which combines content 
and structural features of the user's networked representation. Using 
results obtained for concept representation, credibility estimation will 
be cast as an information fusion problem, with a first step that 
combines textual and visual information and a second step that combines 
user content and context. Another important credibility related question 
that will be investigated is whether credibility should be a global 
characteristic of a user or domain related.

Candidates must hold a PhD in Computer Science or expect to complete it 
before January 2013 and be under 30 years old. Experience in Natural 
Language Processing, Information Retrieval or Computer Vision is 
expected, as well as willingness to learn new topics related to the 
post-doc.

The lab is situated in Palaiseau, 20 km south of Paris and is part of 
the CEA LIST Institute, which focuses its research activities on 
developing innovative technologies for smart and complex systems. The 
post-doc will be part of the lab's multimedia team, which consists of 
researchers in NLP, computer vision and multimedia processing. The 
working language is English. A more detailed description of LVIC's 
activities is available at _http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm_.

For further information, please send an expression of interest to 
adrian.popescu@cea.fr, attaching a CV and a cover letter. The position 
is availablefrom January 2013 and is open until filled.
