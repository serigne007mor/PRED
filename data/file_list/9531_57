BPM 2011 is the ninth conference in a series that provides the most=20=20
distinguished research forum for researchers and practitioners in all=20=20
aspects of BPM including theory, frameworks, methods, techniques,=20=20
architectures, systems, and empirical findings. With an acceptance=20=20
rate in previous editions at around 13% the conference has a record of=20=20
attracting innovative research of highest quality, from a mix of=20=20
disciplines including Computer Science, Management Information=20=20
Science, Services Computing, Services Science, and Technology=20=20
Management.

This year=92s conference will continue with the broad-based themes of=20=20
previous editions, and strives to strengthen and expand in several key=20=20
directions . The conference  encourages emerging research on new=20=20
conceptual models for BPM that attempt to unify core aspects of BPM,=20=20
including process management, data management, business rules and=20=20
requirements, and analytics. The conference also encourages the=20=20
increasing interest in applying established and new techniques, such=20=20
as model-driven architectures, Web services and Web architectures,=20=20
SOA, and Cloud Computing, to the specific challenges of BPM. In this=20=20
context, the conference is also looking for contributions on=20=20
implementation techniques and details for process or Web service=20=20
execution engines with focus on new application areas. Finally, the=20=20
conference seeks to attract papers that highlight the pervasive need=20=20
for BPM capabilities across application areas outside of business=20=20
management, including healthcare delivery, digital g!
overnment, disaster management, and management of scientific and other=20=20
academic endeavors, and that highlight how new techniques can solve=20=20
the distinctive challenges arising in those diverse areas. Awards will=20=20
be given to the best papers in different categories.

BPM 2011 will be held in Clermont-Ferrand, France, and will be=20=20
organized by the LIMOS Laboratory (http://www.isima.fr/limos/), CNRS,=20=20
Universit=E9 Blaise Pascal. The conference will take place at the campus=20=
=20
des cezeaux which is located about minutes from the city center.=20=20
Clermont-Ferrand is a medium-sized city located in the heart of=20=20
Auvergne, one of the most beautiful regions of France: ancient=20=20
volcanoes, lakes and gorges, historic sites and Romanesque=20=20
