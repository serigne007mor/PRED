Subject: [liste-egc] CFP - I3 Journal special issue on Complex Object
 Matching and Discovery

Call for Papers
===============

"Information-Interaction-Intelligence (I3)" Journal 
(http://www.revue-i3.org/)
Special Issue on "Complex Object Matching and Discovery"
========================================================


Important dates
===============
Abstract submission: January 31, 2011 (extended)
Submission deadline: March 31, 2011
Notification: May 31, 2011


Focus of the Special Issue
==========================
Applications such as digital libraries, mediation systems and web 
services-based architectures produce masses of data generating a large 
number of models to be stored with the goal of being accessible to users 
(customers) expressing a specific need, that will be traduced partially 
or completely into a query. These models describe complex objects such 
as documents, business processes, services and ontologies for different 
knowledge domains; they are therefore heterogeneous and rich in terms of 
semantics. Giving the richness of these models and the huge number of 
stored objects, new techniques and tools are required to help user to 
retrieve the object satisfying his needs and preferences. The purpose of 
this special issue is to highlight and explore some of the more recent 
theoretical and practical advances in complex object matching and 
discovery.

Topics of interest for this special issue include, but are not limited to:

* graph matching and indexing,
* service matching and discovery (interface, protocols, QoS factors),
* business process models matching (for version management, delta-analysis,
* inter-organizational processes, etc),
* user profile matching for personalization,
* document matching and retrieval (XML, ..),
* schema matching,
* model management,
* ontology matching,
* resource discovery and matching for semantic web,
* query languages for complex object discovery,
* complex object mining,
* techniques and algorithms for information filtering and indexing,
* application areas : social networks, personalization, SOA, BPM,
* bioinformatics, XML, data and service integration.


Submission Details
==================
Manuscripts should be written in English and prepared for publication in 
accordance with the following instructions: 
http://www.revue-i3.org/Documents/soumission_en.php. The length of the 
paper is limited to 30 pages. Submissions should be sent in pdf format 
to daniela.grigori@prism.uvsq.fr and  ludovic.lietard@univ-rennes1.fr.

Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, presentation as 
well as relevance and contribution to the field of Complex Object 
Matching and Discovery. All papers will be rigorously refereed by 3 peer 
reviewers. Submission of a manuscript to this special issue implies that 
no similar paper is already accepted or will be submitted to any other 
conference or journal.
