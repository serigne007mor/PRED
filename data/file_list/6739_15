[We apologize if you receive multiple copies of this message]

A postdoc position (12 months) on "declarative approaches for interesting
pattern mining
problems" is available from the beginning of October 2011 at the CRIL Lab.-
UMR 8188 CNRS
(Lens, France) in the "Inference and decision process" group (www.cril.fr).

This postdoc is part of the national project DAG (Declarative approaches for
enumerating
interesting pattern in databases) under the ANR DEFIS 2009 program. This
project explores the
cross-fertilization between constraints programming, combinatorics, and
databases to bring
original and modular solutions to pattern mining problems. The partnership
consists of 3 research
groups: Database group at LIRIS (Lyon), algorithmic group at LIMOS
(Clermont-Ferrand) and
constraint programming/Satisfiability group at CRIL (Lens). Work will be
realized in close
cooperation with the partners. Regular visits at LIRIS laboratory
(University Claude Bernard,
Lyon) will be particularly envisaged. More details on:
http://liris.cnrs.fr/dag/

The selected researcher will investigate the following aspects:

- High-level declarative languages (logical or algebraic) for expressing
interesting complex
patterns enumeration problems
- Mining complex patterns using constraint (logic) programming,
Satisfiability (modulo theory),
Integer Linear programming,...

Applicants must have PhD in computer sciences in one of the following areas:
- data mining,
- logic, satisfiability, constraint programming,
- algorithmic,
- or theoretical computer science in general.

Applications should include the following materials:
- a motivation letter
- a detailed CV (with publication list)
- two or three references

The position is open from the 1st of October 2011, the funding is available
for up to 1 year (at
least 2000 euros net monthly salary). The starting date will be extended
until a suitable candidate
will be found. The position is located at Lens in the north of France within
40mn by train from Lille.

Application material should be sent to Lakhdar Sais (sais [at] cril [dot]
fr) and Emmanuel Coquery
(emmanuel [dot] coquery [at] univ-lyon1 [dot] fr). The deadline for
applications is September 3, 2011. Selected
candidates will be interviewed by phone or visio-conference as soon as we
receive their
applications.
