Beyond Facts - 1st International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online 
Discourse Analysis (KnOD)

Collocated with TheWebConf (WWW) 2021

April 19 - 23, Ljubljana (Slovenia)

https://knod2021.wordpress.com/


*Summary*

Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to 
the availability of an abundance of online discourse data, such as 
claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and 
contexts (related events or entities). This data constitutes a valuable 
source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias 
reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting.  While 
knowledge graphs (KGs) promise to provide the key to a Web of structured 
information, they are mainly focused on facts without keeping track of 
the diversity, connection or temporal evolution of online discourse 
data. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their 
interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of 
intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual 
understandings strongly diverge across communities from computational 
social science, to argumentation mining, fact-checking, or 
viewpoint/stance detection.
This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these 
communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, 
extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the 
need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse 
data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and 
reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the 
analysis of societal debates on the Web.

*Topics of interest*

- Knowledge graphs and knowledge extraction techniques in the context of 
online discourse
- Computational fact-checking / truth discovery
- Bias and controversy detection and analysis
- Stance and viewpoint discovery

- Reuse and extension of existing models such as schema.org and Wikidata
- Integration, aggregation, linking and enrichment of discourse data
- Semantic and exploratory search of online discourse data
- Argumentation and reasoning over online discourse
- Recommender systems for discourse data
- Quality, uncertainty, provenance, and trust of discourse data
- Benchmarks and training data for extraction, verification or linking 
of discourse data
