CALL FOR PAPERS

The 2nd International Workshop on
Contextual Information Access, Seeking and Retrieval Evaluation

Milton Keynes, UK, March 28, 2010

http://www.irit.fr/CIRSE

in conjunction with ECIR-2010, http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/ecir2010


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper Submission:           January,  4, 2010
Notification of Acceptance: January, 25, 2010
Camera-Ready papers due:    February, 8, 2010


KEYNOTE SPEAKER

Stephen Robertson
(Microsoft Research, Cambridge, and City University, London, UK)


SUBMISSIONS

To facilitate the presentation of research activities having a
different maturity, the workshop programme will include both long and
short papers covering a range of evaluation methods, techniques and
tools for contextual information access seeking and retrieval.

To give the young researchers an opportunity to present their results
and on-going research, they will be invited to submit short papers and
discuss their contributions in a less formal way. To this end, a short
time will be devoted to the presentation and a longer time will be
devoted to the discussion.  Short papers and long papers will be
respectively 2 pages and 4 pages long using ACM format (
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates ). All
submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by the workshop programme
committee. At least one author of each paper must attend the workshop
to present the paper. All accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.

For more information, please see the workshop website

OVERVIEW

Since the 1990s, the interest in the notion of context in Information
Access, Seeking and Retrieval increased. Many researchers have been
concerning with the use of context in adaptive, interactive,
personalized or collaborative systems, the design of explicit and
implicit feedback techniques, the investigation of relevance, the
application of a notion of context to problems like advertising or
mobile search.

The previous edition of this workshop held in Toulouse (CIRSE 2009)
and other workshops and conferences, i.e. IR in Context (IRiX, 2005),
Adaptive IR (AIR, 2006, 2008), Context-based IR (CIR, 2005, 2007) and
Information Interaction in Context (IIiX, 2006, 2008) gathered
researchers exploring theoretical frameworks and applications which
have focussed on contextual IR systems.

An important issue which gave raise to discussion has been Evaluation.
It is commonly accepted that the traditional evaluation methodologies
used in TREC, CLEF, NTCIR and INEX campaigns are not always suitable
for considering the contextual dimensions in the information
seeking/access process. Indeed, laboratory-based or system oriented
evaluation is challenged by the presence of contextual dimensions such
as user interaction, profile or environment which significantly impact
on the relevance judgments or usefulness ratings made by the end user.

Therefore, new research is needed to understand how to overcome the
challenge of user-oriented evaluation and to design novel evaluation
methodologies and criteria for contextual information retrieval
evaluation.

This workshop aims to have a major impact on future research by
bringing together IR researchers working on or interested in the
evaluation of approaches to contextual information access, seeking and
retrieval to foster discussion, exchange ideas on the related issues.
The main purpose is to bring together IR researchers, to promote
discussion on the future directions of evaluation.


TOPICS

Both theoretical and practical research papers are welcome from both
research and industrial communities addressing the main conference
theme.  Original and unpublished papers are welcome on any aspect
including:

* User system, context and task modelling for information access seeking
and retrieval evaluation.

* Novel techniques for implicit or explicit feedback evaluation.

* Learning algorithms that use non-traditional relevance judgments (such
as click through data, query streams, user interactions).

* Novel or extension of traditional evaluation measures, test collections,
methodologies of operational evaluation.

* Contextual and user simulation algorithms.

* Accuracy evaluation of personal profiles built using implicit set-level
responses.

* Merging ranking from collaborative system outputs.

* Application and evaluation of context-based systems for distributed
retrieval, personal search, mobile search, digital libraries, archives and
museums.

* Application and evaluation of context-based access to television
broadcasted recordings, images, videos and music collections
