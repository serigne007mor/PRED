# Workshop on Representation Learning for Complex Data
May 24, 2019, Lyon, France
http://mediamining.univ-lyon2.fr/workshop2019/

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

## Objective of the Workshop

This workshop aims at gathering researchers from the different fields =
interested in the development of representation learning, such as =
machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing, =
computer vision, data mining. We target researchers from both industry =
and academia to join forces in this exciting area. We intend to discuss =
the recent and significant developments in RL and to promote =
cross-fertilization of techniques.

The program includes six keynote presentations from invited speakers and =
a poster session. The poster session is intended to foster a discussion =
between young researchers who begin working with such techniques and =
experts in the field. You can find more details on the website.

This event is at the initiative of the Data Mining & Decision team of =
the ERIC Lab, Universit=C3=A9 Lumi=C3=A8re Lyon 2. It is supported by =
the Soci=C3=A9t=C3=A9 Fran=C3=A7aise de Statistiques =
(https://www.sfds.asso.fr) and the GdR MaDICS (http://www.madics.fr). =
The GdR can help funding travel cost of young researchers, please =
contact us for further information.

## Registration

The registration is free but mandatory: =

nearby.

If you have to cancel please inform us as soon as possible to free the =
ticket for another attendee.
