  <h2>Call for papers</h2>
  </div>
<p align="justify">Data mining and knowledge discovery can today be considered 
  as stable fields with numerous efficient methods and studies that have been 
  proposed to extract knowledge from data. Nevertheless, the famous golden nugget 
  is still challenging. Actually, the context evolved since the first definition 
  of the KDD process and knowledge has now to be extracted from data getting more 
  and more complex. The structure of the data, for instance, doesn&#8217;t match 
  the attribute-value format when considering the web, texts or videos. </p>
<p align="justify">In the framework of Data Mining, many software solutions were 
  developed for the extraction of knowledge from tabular data (which are typically 
  obtained from relational databases). Methodological extensions were proposed 
  to deal with data initially obtained from other sources, like in the context 
  of natural language (text mining) and image (image mining). KDD has thus evolved 
  following a unimodal scheme instantiated according to the type of the underlying 
  data (tabular data, text, images, etc), which, in the end, always leads to working 
  on the classical double entry tabular format.</p>
<p align="justify">However, in a large number of application domains, this unimodal 
  approach appears to be too restrictive. Consider for instance a corpus of medical 
  files. Each file can contain tabular data such as results of biological analyzes, 
  textual data coming from clinical reports, image data such as radiographies, 
  echograms, or electrocardiograms. In a decision making framework, treating each 
  type of information separately has serious drawbacks. It appears therefore more 
  and more necessary to consider these different data simultaneously, thereby 
  encompassing all their complexity. Many examples of complex data can thus be 
  found in potential knowledge extraction processes. These data can be:</p>
<div align="justify"> 
  <ul>
    <li>Semi-structured or unstructured</li>
    <li>Sensor data such as scientific or medical data</li>
    <li>Representing the same information at different periods</li>
    <li>Grouping different kinds of information (images, text, ontologies, etc.) 
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify">Hence, a natural question arises: how could one combine information 
  of different nature and associate them with a same semantic unit, which is for 
  instance the patient? On a methodological level, one could also wonder how to 
  compare such complex units via similarity measures. The classical approach consists 
  in aggregating partial dissimilarities computed on components of the same type. 
  However, this approach tends to make superposed layers of information. It considers 
  that the whole entity is the sum of its components. By analogy with the analysis 
  of complex systems, it appears that knowledge discovery in complex data can 
  not simply consist of the concatenation of the partial information obtained 
  from each part of the object. The aim would rather be to discover more &laquo; 
  global &raquo; knowledge giving a meaning to the components and associating 
  them with the semantic unit. This fundamental information cannot be extracted 
  by the currently considered approaches and the available tools.</p>
<p align="justify">The new data mining strategies shall take into account the 
  specificities of complex objects (units with which are associated the complex 
  data). These specificities are summarized hereafter: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Different kind</em>. The data associated to an object are of different 
    types. Besides classical numerical, categorical or symbolic descriptors, text, 
    image or audio/video data are often available.</li>
  <li><em>Diversity of the sources</em>. The data come from different sources. 
    As shown in the context of medical files, the collected data can come from 
    surveys filled in by doctors, textual reports, measures acquired from medical 
    equipment, radiographies, echograms, etc. </li>
  <li><em>Evolving and distributed</em>. It often happens that the same object 
    is described according to the same characteristics at different times or different 
    places. For instance, a patient may often consult several doctors, each one 
    of them producing specific information. These different data are associated 
    with the same subject.</li>
  <li><em>Linked to expert knowledge</em>. Intelligent data mining should also 
    take into account external information, also called expert knowledge, which 
    could be taken into account by means of ontology. In the framework of oncology 
    for instance, the expert knowledge is organized under the form of decision 
    trees and is made available under the form of &#8220;best practice guides&#8221; 
    called Standard Option Recommendations (SOR). </li>
  <li><em>Dimensionality of the data</em>. The association of different data sources 
    at different moments multiplies the points of view and therefore the number 
    of potential descriptors. The resulting high dimensionality is the cause of 
    both algorithmic and methodological difficulties. </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The difficulty of Knowledge Discovery in complex data lies 
  in all these specificities.</p>
<p align="justify">The aim of this workshop is to address issues related to the 
  concept of mining complex data. The whole knowledge discovery process being 
  involved, our goal will be to attract papers dealing with each step of this 
  process. Actually, managing complex data within the KDD process implies to work 
  on every step, starting from the pre-processing (e.g. structuring and organizing) 
  to the visualization and interpretation (e.g. sorting or filtering) of the results, 
  via the data mining methods themselves (e.g. classification, clustering, frequent 
  patterns extraction, etc.). Papers are invited in all KDD fields that involve 
  complex data, including, but not limited to:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-processing, structuring and organizing complex data</li>
    <li>Handling missing or wrong values</li>
    <li>Data fusion, result fusion</li>
    <li>Methods and algorithms for mining complex data</li>
    <li>Mining heterogeneous data</li>
    <li>Knowledge integration into the KDD process</li>
    <li>Post-processing, visualization and interpretation support</li>
    <li>Applications and experience feedback</li>
	<li>Information retrieval in complex data bases</li>
	<li>Ontology and metadata</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify">The workshop will consist in a series of communications (oral 
  presentations or poster). A reasonable time will be left for the discussion 
  after each presentation. All the articles will be reviewed by at least two references 
  with a double aim of improving quality and giving advice to the authors. A dedicated 
  place will be given to the young researchers with a session (Position paper) 
  grouping the works in progress in various teams. This can be a good occasion 
  for a PhD student or a young researcher to present his/her starting project. 
  This session will be particularly significant for works on their beginning and 
  for the establishment of research groups on shared topics. Demonstrations of 
  research results could be associated with the poster presentations.</p>
<p align="justify">The submitted manuscript should closely reflect the final paper 
  as it will appear in the Proceedings.</p>

<p align="justify"> Papers should not exceed 12 pages (in Latex format) and should 
  follow <a href="http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-2-72376-0&SHORTCUT=www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,5-164-2-72376-0,00.html" target="_blank">LNCS 
  author guidelines</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">Submitted papers will be evaluated by at least two reviewers. 
  Any submission that exceeds length limits or deviates from formatting requirements 
  may be rejected without review.</p>
