Subject: [liste-egc] CfP: IPMU 2012 Special Session on Belief function
 theory: basics and/or applications - extended deadline: january 15, 2012

CALL FOR PAPERS
Belief function theory: basics and/or applications

Special Session to be held as part of 
IPMU-2012, 14-th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY IN KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
July 9-13, 2010 – Catania, Italy

The belief function theory, also known as Dempster-Shafer theory or evidence theory, is one of the theories for modelling and managing uncertain knowledge. Since its introduction by Shafer, as a model for representing quantified beliefs, this theory has been making remarkable progress and is getting more and more applied in a variety of fields. So, several contributions have been proposed either in its basics or in its applications.
This special session is focused on news trends for research in the belief function framework either in its basics or with related theories. Besides, papers presenting applications of the belief function theory are welcome. So, original papers with theoretical and/or practical contributions are solicited.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 

- Fusion methods
- Decision making
- Statistical inference
- Continuous belief functions
- Relation with other uncertain theories
- Classification
- Clustering
- Datamining
- Graphical models
- Web semantics
- Business decision, etc
