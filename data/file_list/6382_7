CALL FOR PAPERS

The First International workshop on Educational Knowledge Management  (EKM =
2014)

http://www.ida.liu.se/conferences/IWEKM14/

held in collocation with

The 19th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management (EKAW 2014), Link=F6ping, Sweden


Workshop description

The interest in Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management for the
educational domain has been growing in recent years. This can be seen in
the series of conferences organised by the International Educational
Data Mining Society and in papers discussing the role of knowledge
management in higher education. As education is increasingly occurring
online or in educational software, resulting in an explosion of data,
new techniques are being developed and tested, aiming for instance to
improve educational effectiveness, determine the key factors to the
success of educational training, support basic research on learning, or
manage educational training by satisfying the needs of a community,
local industry, or professional development.

We welcome submissions reporting original research related to any
problem of managing and exploring information in the educational area in
schools, colleges, universities, and other academic or professional
learning institutions. A non-exhaustive list of topics for the workshop
includes the following:
Workshop topics

    Educational knowledge management (EKM) and ontology
    EKM and Multi-agent systems
    Data mining and semantic web for EKM
    Educational knowledge acquisition, extraction, reuse
    Natural language processing to improve educational effectiveness
    Providing feedback to teachers and other stakeholders generated from EK=
M methods
    Generic frameworks, methods and approache for EKM
    Learner or student modeling
    Mining browsing or interaction data
    Mining the results of educational research
    Educational process mining
