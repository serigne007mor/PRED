The Eleventh International Conference on
Concept Lattices and Their Applications

http://cla2014.ics.upjs.sk

Kosice, Slovakia, October 7-10, 2014

CLA 2014 will be organized by the Institute of Computer Science,
Pavol Jozef Safárik University in Kosice

=Scope and Areas=

CLA is an international conference dedicated to formal concept
analysis (FCA) and areas closely related to FCA such as data mining,
information retrieval, knowledge management, data and knowledge
engineering, logic, algebra and lattice theory. CLA provides a forum
for researchers, practitioners, and students. The program of CLA
consists of invited plenary talks, regular talks, and poster
sessions. Papers in all areas relevant to theory and applications of
FCA are solicited.

Those areas include but are not restricted to:

* foundations,
* concept lattices and related structures,
* attribute implications, association rules and other data dependencies,
* algorithms,
* visualization,
* data preprocessing,
* redundancy and dimensionality reduction,
* information retrieval,
* classification,
* clustering,
* ontologies,
* applications.

=Important Dates=

Abstract submission: June 7, 2014
Paper submission: June 16, 2014
Notification: August 14, 2014
Final papers due: September 15, 2014
CLA Conference: October 7-10, 2014

=Paper Submission and Publication=

Papers of up to 12 pages to be submitted in PDF format.

Papers must be formatted using the Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science style
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).

The submission is to be done via
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cla2014 .

All papers will be judged based on their technical merits,
originality, relevance to areas of interest, and presentation
clarity.

revise and extend their work in a special issue of a
well-established journal (which name will be made public soon).
