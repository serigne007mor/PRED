<div>[CfP] ECML PKDD 2020 Journal Track</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Website: https://ecmlpkdd2020=2Enet/submissions/journalTrack/</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We invite submissions for the journal track of the European Conferenc=
e on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in=
 Databases (ECMLPKDD) 2020=2E The journal track of the conference is implem=
ented in partnership with the Machine Learning Journal and the Data Mining =
and Knowledge Discovery Journal=2E The conference provides an international=
 forum for the discussion of the latest high-quality research results in al=
l areas related to machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery=
=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Papers on all topics related to machine learning, knowledge discovery=
, and data mining are invited=2E However, given the special nature of the j=
ournal track, only papers that satisfy the quality criteria of journal pape=
rs and at the same time lend themselves to conference talks will be conside=
red=2E Consequently, journal versions of previously published conference pa=
pers, or survey papers will not be considered for the special issue=2E Note=
 that a paper rejected by the Machine Learning Journal should not be submit=
ted to the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal and vice versa=2E Pa=
pers that do not fall into the eligible category may be rejected without fo=
rmal reviews but can of course be resubmitted as regular papers=2E Authors =
are encouraged to adhere to the best practices of Reproducible Research (RR=
), by making available data and software tools for reproducing the results =
reported in their papers=2E For the sake of persistence and proper authorsh=
ip attribution, we require the use of standard repository hosting services =
such as dataverse, mldata, openml, etc=2E for data sets, and mloss, bitbuck=
et, github, etc=2E for source code=2E Authors who submit their work to the =
ECMLPKDD special issues of these journals commit themselves to presenting t=
heir paper at the ECMLPKDD conference if it is accepted=2E Note that for th=
e earlier deadlines, this is likely to be ECMLPKDD 2020, but for the later =
deadlines this may be a later edition=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>REVIEWING</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The journal track allows continuous submissions from September 2019 t=
o mid May 2020=2E Papers will be processed and sent out for review after ea=
ch of the following five cutoff dates:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- November 8, 2019<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- January 10, 2020<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- May 15, 2020 (note that papers submitted by this last=
 deadline cannot possibly be accepted in time for ECMLPKDD 2020 but if acce=
pted will be rolled over for ECMLPKDD 2021)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The deadline on each of these dates is 23:59, Central European Time=
=2E We strive for a high quality and efficient review process=2E For each s=
ubmission, we aim at obtaining three reviews from experienced reviewers, in=
cluding members of the Guest Editorial Board=2E Our goal is to arrive at an=
 initial decision about 10 weeks after each cutoff date, though meeting thi=
s target may not always be possible=2E After the initial review phase, many=
 papers will require substantial revisions, and the revised paper will be r=
e-reviewed, which extends the review process=2E Consequently, a paper&#39;s=
 chance of finishing the review cycle and being included in the ECMLPKDD 20=
20 special issue decreases with each subsequent cutoff date, and for the Ma=
y 15 deadline this is even impossible=2E This means that accepted papers, e=
specially those that were submitted to the later deadlines, may be included=
 in the ECMLPKDD 2021 (or even later) special issue (and subject to approva=
l of the ECMLPKDD steering committee and future organizers)=2E The reviewin=
g process is single-blind=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>SUBMISSION PROCEDURE</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>To submit to this track, authors have to make a journal submission to=
 either the Springer Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal or the Spr=
inger Machine Learning journal (no paper can be submitted to both), and sel=
ect the type of submission to be for the ECMLPKDD 2020 special issue=2E It =
is recommended that submitted papers do not exceed 20 pages including refer=
ences=2E Every paper may be accompanied with unlimited appendices=2E The pa=
pers should be formatted in the Springer journal style (svjour3, smallconde=
nsed, https://www=2Espringer=2Ecom/gp/livingreviews/latex-templates)=2E Bot=
h journals require authors to include an information sheet (for Machine lea=
rning submissions) or a cover letter (up to 2 pages) as a supplementary mat=
erial (for Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery submissions) that contains a=
 short summary of their contribution and specifically address the following=
 questions:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- What is the main claim of the paper? Why is this=
 an important contribution to the machine learning/data mining literature?<=
br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- What is the evidence provided to support claims? Be p=
recise=2E<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Report 3-5 most closely related contributions in the =
past 7 years (authored by researchers outside the authors&acirc;&euro;&trad=
e; research group) and briefly state the relation of the submission to them=
=2E<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Who are the most appropriate reviewers for the paper?=
 Authors are required to suggest up to four candidate reviewers (especially=
 if external to the Guest Editorial Board), including a brief motivation fo=
r each suggestion=2E<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Optionally, list up to four researchers/potential rev=
iewers with competing interests that should not be considered for reviewers=
=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>SUBMIT</div>
