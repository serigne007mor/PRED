will provide a forum for researchers to showcase their work and obtain
feedback on on-going research from knowledgeable conference attendees.
Posters submitted may cover any topic of the conference. They are intended
to convey a scientific result and are not advertisements for commercial
software packages. While posters need not describe completed work, they
should report on research for which at least some preliminary results are
available.

    - Requirements Engineering
    - Database and Information System Integration
    - Data Management
    - Information Search and Discovery
    - Software Testing
    - Human-Computer Interaction
    - Web Information Systems
    - Grid Computing and Cloud Computing

    - Information and Value Management


POSTER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Poster proposals must be submitted as a single PDF file with no more than 2
pages. The two pages shall contain an abstract describing the research
content of the poster, along with the title, authors, institutional
affiliations and electronic contact information.

Submissions will be reviewed and selected proposals will be published in
the RCIS'13 Conference proceedings published by IEEE.

Consequently, poster proposals shall follow the IEEE 2-column format (see
http://rcis-conf.com/rcis2013/calls.php). Poster abstracts that exceed the
limit of 2 pages will be rejected without review.

All posters must be submitted using the conference submission site:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcis2013
Choose "Posters & Demos Papers Section".
Then, in the submission page, after "Title, Abstract and Other Information"
section, select "Poster paper".

The poster dimensions will be 76 cm by 100 cm (30" by 40"), with poster
content mounted on rectangular poster board we will provide. The layout may
consist of several individual sheets of paper or a monolithic large sheet.


IMPORTANT DATES
The deadline for poster submissions is 23:59 Central European Time on
February 15, 2013.
Authors will be notified of acceptance by March 18, 2013.
They will be instructed and asked to provide the camera-ready copy of their
poster by the 5th of April 2013.


POSTERS PRESENTATION
Authors of accepted posters will receive an opportunity to complete a short
oral presentation during a special poster session included in the main
program. Well-crafted posters will tell the story well by themselves, but
authors of posters are expected to be available to describe and discuss the
work presented in the poster during the session. At least one of the poster
authors must be registered at the conference and attend the poster session.
