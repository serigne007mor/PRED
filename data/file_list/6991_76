5th IFIP International Conference on Computer Science and Its Applications

20-21 May, 2015 - Saida University, Algeria

http://ciia2015.ensma.fr/index.php?lng=3Den

All Accepted Papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the IFIP Advanc=
es
in Information and Communication Technology (IFIP-AICT) indexed by DBLP.

Best Papers will be Selected for Special Issues of International Journals
indexed by: Thomson Reuters, Scopus, Elsevier & DPLP.

The fifth International Conference on Computer Science and its Applications
(CIIA=E2=80=992015) will be held from 20-21 may 2015 in Saida, Algeria as f=
or the
previous editions. The main objective of this conference is to provide a fo=
rum
for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the
interaction and collaboration between different research communities relate=
d to
computer science and its applications.
CIIA=E2=80=992015 will also provide an international platform for the prese=
ntation of
research on Software Engineering, Distributed System, Computational
Intelligence, Advanced Information Systems, Advanced Infrastructure design
(distributed, parallel, cloud, grid computing, etc.), and technologies that=
 can
be developed in Algeria and Africa such as scalable and sustainable supply =
and
distribution of energy, etc.  This international scientific event initiated=
 by
researchers from Algeria and extended to cover worldwide researchers aims at
promoting the research in Africa, creating scientific networks, developing
projects and facilitating faculty/student exchanges
As the previous editions, IFIP CIIA 2015 will be held in Saida, Algeria (We=
st
of Algeria, 140 KM from Oran City) from 20 to 21 May 2015.

Submission Procedure
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing
original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or
Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's format available at
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0 and should n=
ot
exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices).
Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which do exceed =
12
pages  will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be carefully
evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clar=
ity
of exposition.
Duplicate submissions are not allowed. A submission is considered to be a
duplicate submission if it is submitted to other conferences/workshops/jour=
nals
or it has been already accepted to be published in other
conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions thus will be
automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require explicit consent
from all listed authors.
All Accepted Papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the IFIP Advanc=
es
in Information and Communication Technology (IFIP-AICT)
(http://www.springer.com/series/6102). Indexed by DBLP.
The submission site is open at:
