CALL FOR PAPERS


*CLEI 2022 - XLVIII Latin American Computing ConferenceArmenia, Colombia*
October 17-21, 2022
https://clei2022.uniquindio.edu.co/

***************************************************************************=
**

CLEI XLVIII calls for papers reporting results of a theoretical nature
and/or practice
that advance the state of the art or present relevant applications or cases
in the areas
of interest of the symposia or associated events. CLEI XLVIII will be held
in Armenia, Colombia,
from October 17 to 21, 2022, in a hybrid edition, allowing the
participation of exhibitors
and attendees both in person and virtually. This year the Journal First
format is incorporated,
seeking to expand communication within the scientific community.

The Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI) is an annual event organised
by the Latin American
Center for Computational Studies (CLEI), and since 1974, it is a travelling
event between
Latin American countries. CLEI is the main Latin American forum for
exchanging ideas, experiences
and research results between researchers, professionals and students in
informatics and computer
science and engineering, as well as its technological applications, through
conferences, workshops,
tutorials and panels.

one of the CLEI
symposium or events (the proposed topics for each theme are just
indicative; they do not
intend to be restrictive.) Please check the full list of symposia and
associated events at the end
of this document.


*Publication and Indexing:*In order to guarantee the publication of an
accepted article in the Conference Annals, at least
one of the authors must register for the conference. The article must also

extended version of
the original article in English, which will undertake a new review process.


*Journal First (NEW!!)*Authors of articles accepted in indexed journals are
invited to present their research work at
CLEI. Papers must be on one(s) of the conference symposium topics. This
offers an opportunity for
authors to discuss their work with the community, as well as to enrich the
CLEI scientific program.

The main evaluation criteria to select the articles are the description of
original results that
have not been presented in previous conference papers and the quality of
the journal where it was
first published. In addition, the article must have been accepted for
publication in the journal

H=C3=A9ctor Cancela, Universidad de la Rep=C3=BAblica, Uruguay
Rhadam=C3=A9s Carmona, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Venezuela

CLTM aims at disseminating the work of Latin American students who have
recently completed
their Master's thesis in Computing or Informatics, whose content is related
to any of the areas
described in IEEE/ACM documents on the computing curriculum. Only students
graduated from
a university that is a member of CLEI can participate in the contest



*CLTD - VIII Latin American Contest of Doctoral Thesis *Chairs:
Gabriela Mar=C3=ADn, Universidad de Costa Rica, Costa Rica
Jos=C3=A9 Francisco Tirado Fern=C3=A1ndez, Universidad Complutense de Madri=
d, Espa=C3=B1a

recently completed
their Doctoral Theses in Computing and Informatics. By that is meant a
thesis whose content
is related to any of the areas described in IEEE/ACM documents on the
computing curriculum.
Only students graduated from a university that is a member of CLEI



*LAWCC - XIV Latin American Women in Computing Congress*Chairs:
Mar=C3=ADa Elena Garc=C3=ADa, Universidad Nacional de Asunci=C3=B3n, Paragu=
ay
Maristela Terto De Holand, Universidade de Bras=C3=ADlia, Brasil

LAWCC will be held as part of XLVIII CLEI. Its main objective is to
highlight the research,
interests, and achievements of women in the various areas of computing,
with the intention
of encouraging the active participation of more women. The paper
presentations will hopefully
help to identify the challenges women face in the area of Information and
Communications Technologies
(ICT), teaching, labour market and research. LAWCC seeks ways to address
recurrent problems related
to gender and foster dialogue with society on these matters.



*WNAPC - XII Workshop on Accreditation and Nomenclature of Computing
Programs*Chairs:
Ernesto Cuadros-Vargas, Sociedad Peruana de Computaci=C3=B3n, Per=C3=BA

WNAPC brings together academics, administrators and professors from Latin
America, Spain and
the United States to examine the variation of names of computing programs
in relation to their
contents and to elaborate proposals on that matter. Due to this variation,
there is a need to
reach a joint agreement on competencies that represent the main careers of
the Computing area.
The event aims at identifying specific content differences in undergraduate
computing careers
across several Latin American countries, as well as at strengthening
existing de facto standards.
The workshop organisers consider it very important that undergraduate
programs be coherent in
their content, the set of skills they foster, the degrees they award and
the training of the
faculty. The organisers believe that that coherence would increase the
mobility of professionals
within the region and also outwards, greatly increasing the level of
understanding of who we form
in our programs. Industry's medium-term interest is also contemplated, as
it will simplify
the development of projects in more than one country.



*LANC - XII Latin American Networking Conference *Chairs:
Eric Gamess - Jacksonville State University, USA
Daniel Guidoni -Universidade Federal de S=C3=A3o Jo=C3=A3o del Rei, Brazil

LANC is an international technical forum for experts from industry and
academia from around the world,
but especially from Latin American countries, to exchange ideas and present
results of ongoing research in the networking area.



*ELI - I Latin American School of Informatics *Chairs:
Yudith Cardinale, Universidad Sim=C3=B3n Bol=C3=ADvar, Venezuela Edwin Mont=
oya,
Universidad EAFIT, Colombia

The objective of ELI is to promote a space for training in Computer Science
and Informatics,
allowing the participation of professionals, undergraduate and postgraduate
students, and researchers.
This school begins as a natural evolution of the CLEI tutorials and short
courses, including avant-garde
topics related not exclusively to the symposiums.
