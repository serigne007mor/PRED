Evolution of scientic domains: a longitudinal analysis

The Web makes the results and discoveries obtained through the=20=20
scientific progress much more available nowadays than in earlier=20=20
decades. In particular, scientific articles are used by worldwide=20=20
teams not only for pursuing their own interests, but also for starting=20=20
new collaborations, creating special journal issues, and organizing=20=20
international conferences. These events seldom occur randomly: they=20=20
are often the result of preliminary works and transversal=20=20
collaborations. Researchers of the ERIC Lab are currently working on=20=20
the longitudinal analysis of bibliographic data, with a particular=20=20
interest in the diagnostics and prediction of such events.

In this context, the student's work will focus on the comparison of=20=20
existing techniques for analyzing the evolution of the scientific=20=20
literature. Different approaches can be tested and the student should=20=20
make a full state of the art. This includes, on the one hand, the=20=20
previous works dealing with bibliographic data (e.g., Klink et al.=20=20
2006, or Za=EFane et al. 2009). On the other hand, she/he could see the=20=
=20
topic models developed more especially for text mining (e.g., Blei and=20=20
Lafferty 2006, or Rosen-Zvi et al. 2010). These models are mainly=20=20
focused on the extraction of the main tendencies but could be extended=20=20
to deal with events (see the work of Pons-Porrata et al. 2002).=20=20
Several packages are freely available nowadays for testing these=20=20
probabilistic models (for instance, see Mallet http://mallet.cs.umass.edu=20
).

In order to validate the chosen approaches, the student will have=20=20
access to various bibliographic databases, such as DBLP (http://www.informa=
tik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db=20
) or Pascal (http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/DataBase/214.jsp). The=20=20
comparison will be based on purely predictive quantitative measures,=20=20
such as perplexity, but also on human judgment (e.g., Boyd-Graber et=20=20
al. 2009). Recent work on topic extraction evaluation has been done in=20=20
the lab (Musat et al. 2011); it can be used as a start by the student.=20=20
The second stage of this internship consists in focusing on one=20=20
interesting event: emergence of a new topic, publication of an=20=20
original paper, creation of a new community, etc. To begin with, we=20=20
propose to follow a purely descriptive approach in order to build an=20=20
explanation of the occurrence of this particular event. The last stage=20=20
will draw future lines of research for developing new machine learning=20=20
models dealing with scientific events. These (future) models must be=20=20
able to handle the different actors who populate a research domain:=20=20
articles, authors, journals, conferences etc.
