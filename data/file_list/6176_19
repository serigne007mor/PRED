# Aim and Scope

The International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems is an=20
established international event for presenting and discussing scientific=20
contributions about technical, economical, and societal aspects of=20
distributed information systems at scale.

The guiding theme of this 29th conference is "Human-centric Information=20
Systems", with a particular focus on the following areas:

- Topic 1: Knowledge Graphs and Data, Information, and Knowledge=20
Engineering
- Topic 2: Inductive Learning, Machine-Learning and Knowledge Discovery
- Topic 3: Process Analytics and Technology
- Topic 4: Semantic Interoperability and Open Standards
- Topic 5: Human-centric Security and Privacy in Information Systems
- Topic 6: Internet of Things and Digital Twins
- Topic 7: Architecture and Management of Information Systems
- Topic 8: Human Aspects and Social Interaction in Information Systems
- Topic 9: Services and Cloud in Information Systems
- Topic 10: Applications of Human-centric Information Systems

For a detailed description of these topics, please see the conference=20
Web site at www.coopisconference.org

Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that=20
are not under review for any other conference, workshop, or journal.=20
Papers must be written in English. The contributions should address=20
research questions that relate to one of the topics listed above.

We particularly encourage:

1. Contributions that introduce and evaluate technological innovations=20
(e.g. new techniques, tools, methods or software).

2. Empirical studies (e.g. quantitative data on the effects of novel=20
approaches in technical, social, or economical terms).

3. Systematic surveys of emerging technologies and competing paradigms.

4. Case studies in various application areas of human-centric=20
information systems, such as Healthcare, Industry 4.0, learning=20
analytics, compliance and control or any other industry.

The questions addressed should both be practically relevant and=20
appealing to the general IS field. Full papers should include a=20
systematic evaluation of the contribution and relate this contribution=20
to related scientific work. Short papers may present work supported by=20
preliminary evidence only.

Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. Papers=20
are evaluated in terms of originality, significance, technical=20
soundness, and clarity.

Submissions for full papers must not exceed 18 pages in the final=20
camera-ready paper style. Short papers can cover up to 8 pages.=20
Submissions must be laid out according to the final camera-ready=20
formatting instructions and must be submitted in PDF format.

Each accepted paper must have one of its authors registered to the=20
conference before the camera-ready deadline. The conference organizers=20
reserve the right of removing a paper from the proceedings if no author=20
is officially registered by the camera-ready deadline. Moreover, only=20
papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference=20
will be published in the conference proceedings.

The final proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in their=20
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Author instructions can be=20
