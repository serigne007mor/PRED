The 18th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on TOOLS with ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI-2006),

Washington, D.C. November 13-15, 2006. http://www.nvc.cs.vt.edu/ictai06

The annual IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial
Intelligence (ICTAI) provides a major international forum where the creation
and exchange of ideas relating to artificial intelligence are fostered among
academia, industry, and government agencies. The conference facilitates the
cross-fertilization of these ideas and promotes their transfer into
practical tools, for developing intelligent systems and pursuing artificial
intelligence applications. The ICTAI encompasses all the technical aspects
of specifying, developing, and evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and
applied mechanisms of AI tools. A selection of the best papers in the
conference will be published in a special issue of the International Journal
on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT).

Some Topics but not limited to the following:
AI in Software Engineering; AI in Bioinformatics; AI in Games; AI in
Multimedia Systems; AI in Real-time and Embedded Applications; AI in
E-commerce; AI in Database and Data Mining; AI in Medicine; AI in Computer
Security and Information Assurance; AI in Robotics; AI in logistics and
Supply Chain Management; Case-Based Reasoning; Cognitive Modeling;
Constraint Programming; Collaborative Software Agents; Fuzzy Logic and
Reasoning Under Uncertainty; Evolutionary Computing; Hybrid Intelligent
Systems; Intelligent Tutoring/Training Systems; Intelligent Internet Agents;
Intelligent Interface Agents; Knowledge-based Systems; Knowledge Creation;
Knowledge Discovery; Representation and Ontology; AI Algorithms; Intelligent
Information Retrieval; Knowledge Extraction; Management and Sharing; Machine
Learning; Natural Language Processing and Speech Understanding; Neural
Networks; Search and Heuristics; Planning and Scheduling; Qualitative
Reasoning; Vision and Image Processing.
