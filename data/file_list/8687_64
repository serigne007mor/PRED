Call for Demos

http://www.ecmlpkdd2014.org/

For ECML PKDD 2014 in Nancy, France, we solicit submissions for demos. Subm=
issions must describe=20
working systems and be based on state-of-the-art machine learning and data =
mining technology.=20
These systems may be innovative prototype implementations or mature systems=
 that use=20
machine learning techniques and knowledge discovery processes in a real set=
ting.=20
We particularly welcome demos that use open-source software and offer innov=
ative services.

Demo submissions will be evaluated on relevance, maturity of the systems to=
 be presented=20
and technical challenges they solve, but also on potential usefulness to a =
large number=20
of conference attendees.=20

The accepted papers for demos will be included in the conference proceeding=
s,=20
to be published by Springer Verlag in the "Lecture Notes in Artificial Inte=
lligence"=20
(LNAI) Series. The demos will be presented in a special demonstration sessi=
on.=20
At least one of the demo submitters must register for the conference, and p=
erform=20
the demo on site.=20

Submission Guidelines

All aspects of the submission and notification process will be handled onli=
ne via=20
the CMT conference management toolkit accessible from the conference web.=
=20=20
Please choose the right track during the submission. Instructions concernin=
g the submission,=20
camera-ready formatting and copyright transfer for conference papers also h=
old for demo papers,=20
unless otherwise specified.

A demonstration submission must be up to 4 pages long. It must provide adeq=
uate information=20
on the system=E2=80=99s components and the way the system is operated. Figu=
res, screenshots=20
and interactive demonstration plans may be included if necessary. The autho=
rs must further=20
provide a URL that points to a preview of the demonstration which can be se=
en as a companion=20
webpage including more material, a detailed documentation and if possible t=
he tool itself.

Submitters should keep in mind that the description of a demo has inherentl=
y different=20
content than a research paper submitted to the main conference. A successfu=
l demonstration=20
paper provides satisfactory answers the following questions:

- What makes the presented piece of software unique and special?
- What are the innovative aspects or in what way/area does it represent the=
 state of the art?
- For whom is it most interesting/useful =E2=80=93 for an ML/DM researcher,=
 for a graduate=20
 or undergraduate student in these areas, for a practitioner?
- If there are similar/related pieces of software, what are the advantages =
and disadvantages=20
 of the presented one?

The formatting guidelines of Springer Verlag for the LNAI series apply, and=
 the author=20
instructions and style files under http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors=
.html must be used.
