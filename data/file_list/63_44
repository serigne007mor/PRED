CALL FOR PAPERS


First International Workshop on Web Information Systems Reengineering
(WISR 2008)
http://cedric.cnam.fr/wisr08/

to be held in conjunction with

The Ninth International Conference on Web Information Systems
Engineering (WISE 2008)
http://wise2008.mucoms.org/
Auckland (New Zealand), September 1-4, 2008


GOAL

Most of Web Information Systems (WIS) are still developed in ad hoc
manner causing many problems and leading to difficulties to be
maintained and to evolve.
They generally suffer from a lack of performance and security. Most of
these systems are still developed without systematic approaches.
In order for a WIS to be successful, it should be easy to navigate and
should contain information easily understood.
If a WIS is missing some of the characteristics such as ease of use,
navigation facilities, security, performance, evolving capabilities,
etc., then a reengineering process may be in order.
Besides, web reengineering can lead to a re-conceptualization and
re-design of existing WIS. It may be required to re-design the WIS to
match evolving requirements needs and/or to integrate new web technologies.
However, reengineering existing WIS is a complex task especially when
high performance and high level of security are required and/or when old
interfaces have to be supported.
The aim of this workshop is twofold: identify recurring problems and
issues, and provide guidelines and solutions to solve them. Another goal
is to provide methods, models, and tools for WIS reengineering and
re-design.


TOPICS

WIS-R will provide an opportunity to bring together members of the WIS
engineering and reengineering community as well as members of the
information system community to discuss problems,
issues, methods, models, architectures, platforms, techniques, and tools
related to WIS reengineering.

Topics of particular interest include (but are not limited to):
- Maintenance of existing WIS
- Migration of existing WIS
- Evolution of existing WIS
- WIS content re-writing
- Reengineering of existing WIS
- WIS reverse engineering techniques
- Methods, models, and tools for WIS reengineering and evolution
- Reengineering WIS user interfaces
- Model-based approaches for WIS reverse engineering
- Re-design of the interaction between web-based applications and legacy
information systems
- Architectures for WIS reengineering
- WIS evolution using design patterns
- Reverse engineering of WIS content and structure
- Quality metrics for WIS re-design
- Effort and cost estimation of WIS re-design
- Real-life case studies for large-scale WIS reengineering
- Requirement engineering for WIS evolution
- Migration and integration of legacy system to Web environments
- Web semantic technologies for WIS evolution
- Management of the WIS evolution
