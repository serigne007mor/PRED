4th International Conference on Knowledge Management, Information and  
Knowledge Systems (KMIKS 2019)

We invite you to submit a paper to KMIKS 2017 conference in  
Casablanca, Morocco, April 24-26, 2019

Conference URL : http://www.kmiks.org/


The international conference on Knowledge Management, Information and  
Knowledge Systems (KMIKS) aims to gather both researchers and  
practitioners to discuss organizational, technological and  
socio-cultural aspects of research and development of knowledge  
management systems.
More and more organizations are becoming aware of the importance of  
tacit and explicit knowledge owned by their members which corresponds  
to their experience and accumulated knowledge about the firm  
activities. However, considering the large amount of knowledge created  
and used in the organization, especially with the evolution of  
information and communications technologies, the firm must first  
determine the specific knowledge on which it is necessary to focus.  
Creating activities to enhance identification, preservation, and use  
of this knowledge is a powerful mean to improve the level of the  
economic performance of the organization. Thus, companies invest on  
knowledge management programs, in order to develop a knowledge sharing  
and collaboration culture, to increase individual and organizational  
learning, to make easier accessing and transferring knowledge, and to  
insure knowledge preservation. Several researches can be considered to  
develop knowledge management programs supported by information and  
knowledge systems, according to their context, their culture and the  
stakeholders’ viewpoints.
Researchers and practitioners are invited to propose recent advances  
in methodologies, models and tools for knowledge management within  
organizations.

Topics of interest will include, but are not limited to:
Methodologies and computer supporting tools for knowledge management   
Models for knowledge management  Knowledge sharing and collaboration   
Knowledge retention and transfer  Decision support systems for  
knowledge management  Knowledge management systems  Knowledge  
management and business process modeling  Evaluation and measurement  
of knowledge management systems  Inter-organizational knowledge  
management  Social and human factors in knowledge management  Ontology  
for knowledge management  Organizational memory  Multi-agent systems
