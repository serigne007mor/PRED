##########################################
June 17th, 2020
##########################################
9:00 CEST Keynote Presentation:
* Neef, Martin. =E2=80=94 What Is It That Ends with a Full Stop?

It is often assumed that punctuation marks such as the full stop end =
sentences. Such a statement only works if the sentence in written =
language is a different term than a sentence in grammar. I will try to =
distinguish between these two concepts, thereby reflecting on the =
general relationship between spoken and written language.
------------------------------------------
10:00 CEST
* Meletis, Dimitrios. =E2=80=94 Is the Syllable Universally the Most =
Salient Unit of Writing?

This talk addresses two questions: Firstly, is the phonological syllable =
the central linguistic unit for writing? Evidence suggests that syllabic =
writing systems are easier to learn and that syllables play a crucial =
role in reading and writing. Secondly, do writing systems exhibit =
suprasegmental =E2=80=9Csyllabic=E2=80=9D structures that are =
independent of phonology? How are they defined and what role do they =
play?
------------------------------------------
10:30 CEST
* Evertz-Rittich, Martin. =E2=80=94 What Is a Written Word and If So, =
How Many

In this talk, we will discuss how we can define the notoriously elusive =
unit word in writing. We will start by examining definitions of the =
graphematic word in alphabetical writing systems and discuss how the =
written word relates to other units in writing and in phonology. =
Finally, we will have a look at non-alphabetic writing systems, such as =
Chinese and Japanese.
------------------------------------------
11:10 CEST
* Osterkamp, Sven and Gordian Schreiber. =E2=80=94 Challenging the =
Dichotomy between Phonography and Morphography: Transitions and Grey =
Areas

This talk revisits the fundamental distinction between phonography and =
morphography on the level of graphs (as opposed to overall writing =
systems), drawing upon cases from three areas: 1) transitions from =
morphograms to phonograms and vice-versa; 2) considerations of semantics =
in the choice of phonograms; 3) grey areas in which a given graph is =
indeterminable as to its typological status.
------------------------------------------
11:40 CEST
* Harbour, Daniel. =E2=80=94 Vowel Writing and the Role of Grammar in =
Writing System Evolution

Unwritten vowels are a recurrent feature of Afroasiatic writing systems, =
but they decline sharply when such systems are borrowed by =
non-Afroasiatic languages (compare, e.g., Phoenician and Greek). I argue =
that these differences are at root morphosyntactic not phonological and =
that they illustrate a broader thesis, that grammar is a driving force =
in writing system evolution.
------------------------------------------
12:10 CEST
* Jee, Hana, Monica Tamariz and Richard Shillcock. =E2=80=94 Quantifying =
Sound-Graphic Systematicity and Application on Multiple Phonographs

The study is to show that the relation between letters and sounds is not =
perfectly arbitrary. I found small but significant letter-sound =
correlations across six conventional orthographies. No correlation was =
found in fictitious orthographies. It looks like human orthography =
systems have evolved in a way to maximise the systematicity because it =
is how our brain works.
------------------------------------------
14:00 CEST
* Taha, Haitham. =E2=80=94 The Role of Semantic Activation during Word =
Recognition in Arabic among Typical and Poor Readers

In this talk I'll present and experiment that shows how knowing the =
meaning of words contribute to the reading accuracy and speed of these =
words. Knowing the meaning of the word that we read, and even we are not =
familiar with its written pattern, contributes to the reading accuracy =
and speed.
------------------------------------------
14:30 CEST
* Rashwan, Hany. =E2=80=94 Comparing the Visual Untranslatability of =
Ancient Egyptian and Arabic Writing Systems

The paper discusses the mechanism of visual jin=C4=81s (roughly meaning =
wordplay) in both ancient Egyptian and Arabic languages. It demonstrates =
the significance of looking into several overlooked visual aesthetics, =
which were mainly designed to stimulate the eyes and minds of the =
indigenous readers, to shape any theory related to the literary meaning =
of ancient Egyptian or Arabic writing systems.
------------------------------------------
15:00 CEST
* Donnelly, Kevin. =E2=80=94 Digitising Swahili in Arabic Script

This presentation argues that script displacement (an older script S1 =
being replaced by a newer script S2) can be offset by transitioning S1 =
heritage manuscripts to a fully digital format (rather than, say, =
digital scans). It presents tools enabling this for Swahili in Arabic =
script (the principles could apply elsewhere), showing the varied =
layouts possible in the resulting pdf documents.
------------------------------------------
15:30 CEST
* Ashourinia, Kaveh. =E2=80=94 Quantifying the Ambiguity of No Short =
Vowels in Persian Writing

The absence of short vowels and the duality role of a few consonants as =
long vowels in Persian writing amplifies the ambiguity of written words. =
This contributes to ambiguity in sentences, introducing challenges when =
using search engines, databases and during transliteration from and to =
Persian. This study introduces an analytic approach to quantifying this =
ambiguity.
------------------------------------------
16:10 CEST POSTER SESSION A
------------------------------------------
* Fedorova, Liudmila. =E2=80=94 To the Typology of Writing Systems

The presentation aims to show the itinerary going from picture messages =
to alphabets, from linguistic emblems to characters. The dimensions used =
are: linear/nonlinear (emblematic), integral or decomposed, =
reduced/complete writing (from omitting vowels to the Greek =
=E2=80=98democracy=E2=80=99 for vowels). The main antinomy trends are =
differentiation and integration of writing units, so that we have today =
the coexistence of emblems-emoticons, Chinese characters and highly =
differentiated alphabets.

* Melka, Tomi S. and Robert M. Schoch. =E2=80=94 A Case in Point: =
Communication with Unknown Intelligence/s (16:40-17:10 CEST)

We discuss, from a semiotic perspective, one important =
variable=E2=80=94anthropocentrism=E2=80=94present in various proposed =
messages intended to communicate with off-world intelligences. Our =
review of different scenarios reveals embedded flaws to various degrees. =
This should not be a reason for desisting in the pursuit of SETI-style =
(Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) passive =E2=80=9Clistening=E2=80=
=9D or active =E2=80=9Cmessaging=E2=80=9D programs; however, in tandem =
with such SETI-style programs, a robust and efficient strategy for =
potential contact should be developed as well.

* Schoch, Robert M. and Tomi S. Melka. =E2=80=94 A =E2=80=9CSacred =
Amulet from Easter Island =E2=80=93 1885/6 =E2=80=93=E2=80=9D: Analyzing =
Enigmatic Glyphic Characters in the Context of the rongorongo Script =
(16:10-16:40 CEST)

The rongorongo script of Easter Island has eluded an agreed upon =
decipherment, hampered fundamentally by a small corpus. A newly =
discovered artifact (collected in 1885/6) displays a dozen =
rongorongo-like signs, including an apparently previously unknown glyph =
and the second recorded occurrence of the =E2=80=9Cfull moon=E2=80=9D =
glyph. Initial analysis of the piece suggests a =E2=80=9Clunar-based =
calendar=E2=80=9D designed for propitiatory and/or divination purposes.

* Verheijen, Lieke. =E2=80=94 The Effects of Emoji and Emoticons in =
Webcare

When responding to online consumer messages (especially complaints), =
organizations can choose to use emoji in their digital writing. But does =
the addition of these tiny visual elements in so-called webcare improve =
consumers' perceptions of the organization, such as corporate reputation =
or brand evaluations? My research suggests that overall it does, mostly =
by making the writing sound more conversational and human.

* V=C3=A9ry, Dalma. =E2=80=94 The Mediality of Typography and Textual =
Space

The presentation aims to explore typography and textual space from =
semiological and phenomenological perspectives to reveal the =
characteristics and possibilities inherent in print and digital media.

* Vlachou, Irene and Laurence Penney. =E2=80=94 Parametric Fallback =
Fonts for the Web

FauxFoundry is a webfont service providing matching synthetic fonts to =
expand the character set of Latin fonts. Web developers drag-drop Latin =
fonts onto the FauxFoundry website, which generates CSS code that the =
developer incorporates into their own website. We designed a parametric =
font, which varies over 12 variation axes in response to 12 measurements =
taken from key characters in the Latin font.
------------------------------------------
17:10 CEST
* Presutti, Stefano. =E2=80=94 The Interdependence between Speech and =
Writing. Towards a Greater Awareness

This paper investigates the relationships developed over time between =
speech and writing, especially in the Western world. Nowadays their =
relations are becoming more complex in the digital arena, challenged by =
intersections of technical resources and multiple needs of individuals =
and language communities. The paper discusses why is important today to =
develop a greater awareness on the complexity of their interdependence.
------------------------------------------
17:40 CEST
* Gnanadesikan, Amalia. =E2=80=94 S1: The Native Script Effect

Many linguists believe firmly that writing and language are cognitively =
fundamentally different. Yet various evidence suggests not only that =
scripts have grammatical properties but that one=E2=80=99s first script =
(S1) dominates later-learned scripts (S2) analogously to how one=E2=80=99s=
 first language (L1) dominates L2. This effect can explain the curious =
historical fact that the world=E2=80=99s many written languages use =
relatively few scripts.

This day is dedicated to the memory of Dominique Boutet, who passed away =
a few days before the conference, from COVID-19.
------------------------------------------
9:00 CEST POSTER SESSION B
------------------------------------------
* Bianchini, Claudia Savina. =E2=80=94 How to Improve Metalinguistic =
Awareness by Writing a Language without Writing: Sign Languages and Sign =
Writing

One of the advantages of Writing is the possibility to "freeze" the =
orality, allowing to reflect on the language characteristics and to =
generate metalinguistic awareness. The Sign Languages used by the deaf =
miss a writing system, but several attempts exist for representing them =
graphically. Among these, SignWriting, which seems well suited for =
promoting metalinguistic thinking, thanks to its high readability.

* Drozhashchikh, Nataliia, Elena Efimova and Evgenia Meshcheryakova. =E2=80=
=94 Form-Meaning Regularities in Old English Thesaurus and Corpora

The authors focus on correlation between the initial grapheme/lexical =
semantics in A Thesaurus of Old English/corpora to reveal non-random =
form-meaning association. Referential meanings of words starting with =
=E2=80=B9w=E2=80=BA, =E2=80=B9s=E2=80=BA, =E2=80=B9h=E2=80=BA and =
=E2=80=B9p=E2=80=BA were explored. The application of methodology =
(chi-square test and coefficient of contingency) enabled us to provide =
statistically relevant evidence of such correlation and shed light on =
the form-meaning hypothesis.

* Giunashvili, Helen. =E2=80=94 Old Aramaic Script in Georgia

Old Aramaic and its script are mostly important for the history of the =
Georgian culture. On the territory of contemporary Georgia, particularly =
in its Eastern part, being historically Iberian kingdom (4th c. BC =E2=80=93=
 4th c. AD), a number of original Aramaic inscriptions are found. They =
are inscribed on different objects and could be dated by the period of =
3rd c. BC - 3rd c. AD. The greater part of these Aramaic inscriptions is =
executed in a variety of the North-Mesopotamian type of Aramaic script, =
known as =E2=80=9CArmazian=E2=80=9D, one of the outgrowths of the =
Imperial (Official) Aramaic writing, widely used in Achaemenid Empire =
(550 BC =E2=80=93 330 BC). The whole corpus of the Aramaic inscriptions =
of Georgia requires systematic interdisciplinary researches, for =
revealing the main trends of its typological development in the light of =
Near Eastern-South Caucasian cultural-linguistic interference.

* Joyce, Terry and Hisashi Masuda. =E2=80=94 Constructing a Database of =
Japanese Compound Words:=20

Some Observations on the Morphological Structures of Three- and =
Four-Kanji Compound Words
Japanese kanji function as the core building blocks for the graphematic =
representation of a considerable proportion of the Japanese lexicon.  =
This presentation reports on the ongoing construction of a database of =
Japanese compound words, with particular focus on analyzing the =
morphological structures of three-kanji compound words (3KCWs) and =
four-kanji compound words (4KCWs).

* Morioka, Tomohiko. =E2=80=94 Viewpoints on the Structural Description =
of Chinese Characters

Many Chinese characters are complex characters composed of multiple =
components. However, it is not always clear what their structure and =
components are. In this presentation, the author focuses on the =
productivity of the components.

* Myers, James. =E2=80=94 Levels of Structure within Chinese Character =
Constituents

Chinese characters are composed of morpheme-like constituents, =
themselves composed of phoneme-like strokes. I argue that in between =
these levels there is also a level of syllable-like units, which can =
undergo stress-like prominence, have onset-rime-like internal structure, =
and compete for space within a constituent the way real syllables do.
------------------------------------------
10:00 CEST
* Perono Cacciafoco, Francesco and Colin Loh Jia Sheng. =E2=80=94 A New =
Approach to the Decipherment of Linear A: Coding to Decipher Linear A, =
Stage 2 (Cryptanalysis and Language Deciphering: A =E2=80=98Brute Force =
Attack=E2=80=99 on an Undeciphered Writing System)

Linear A is one of the writing systems of the Ancient Aegean Minoan =
civilization of Crete. Unlike Linear B, derived from Linear A, Linear A =
remains undeciphered despite numerous attempts. With differing arguments =
made about deciphering Linear A, we aim to develop a software using =
Python that enables significant clusters of Linear A symbols to be =
isolated and analysed.
------------------------------------------
10:30 CEST
* Salgarella, Ester and Simon Castellan. =E2=80=94 SigLA. The Signs of =
Linear A: A Linguistic and Palaeographic Database

This paper presents an interactive database of inscriptions written in =
Linear A, a writing system used in Bronze Age Crete to write the still =
undeciphered Minoan language. The database (under construction) will =
allow users to overcome the limits set by the traditional print corpus, =
by carrying out combinatory palaeographic and linguistic searches, thus =
making the most of the existing evidence.
------------------------------------------
11:10 CEST
* Elti di Rodeano, Sveva. =E2=80=94 Scripts in Contact: The Transmission =
of the First Alphabets

The transmission of the alphabet is often presented as unidirectional, =
from the Levant to the Mediterranean, via the Greeks and Romans across =
Europe (Gelb 1963). A new approach allows a less decisive role for the =
Greeks (Waal 2018, 2020), leaving unaddressed the mode of transmission. =
Reports about teaching methods in ancient literatures highlight the =
underlying cognitive processes in the spelling and visual composition. =
The theoretical frame based upon Caramazza-Miceli (1990) will be used to =
explain how the transmission of the first alphabets could have taken =
place.
------------------------------------------
11:40 CEST
* Pierson, Morgane. =E2=80=94 Beyond the Semantic: Typographic =
Representation of Ancient Monetary Inscriptions

The PIM project aims to assess the needs and meet the expectations of =
researchers, publishers, and the BNF, by creating a typeface to =
transcribe, publish and analyze the information contained on monetary =
inscriptions, beyond their semantic content. In partnership with the =
ANRT the writing systems studied are, inter alia, the Phoenician, Punic, =
Archa=C3=AFc Greek, Paleo-Hebrew, Etruscan, Oscan, Umbrian, and =
Nabatean. (See here and here.)
------------------------------------------
12:10 CEST
* Fendel, Victoria Beatrix. =E2=80=94 A Small Step for a Man, a Giant =
Leap for a People: The Beginnings of the Coptic Alphabet

The paper looks at the beginnings of the Coptic alphabet in first- and =
second-century Egypt from different angles. It reviews and builds on the =
sometimes-contradictory research from a social perspective also =
considering practical challenges for the ancient writers. It explores =
the relevance of cognitive factors in the transition to the first =
alphabetic writing system for the Egyptian language.
------------------------------------------
14:00 CEST Keynote Presentation:
* Coon, Jessica. =E2=80=94 The Linguistics of Arrival: What an Alien =
Writing System Can Teach Us about Human Language

If aliens arrived, could we communicate with them? How different can =
languages be from one another? Do these differences have bigger =
consequences for how we see the world? And how might differences in =
writing systems reflect or influence cognition? Jessica Coon, =
linguistics consultant for the film Arrival, will discuss these and =
other questions through the lens of the Heptapod language.
------------------------------------------
15:00 CEST
* Landragin, Fr=C3=A9d=C3=A9ric, Yannis Haralambous and Kenichi Handa. =
=E2=80=94 Graphemic and graphetic methods in speculative fiction

Some authors of speculative fiction (science-fiction, fantasy, etc.) use =
innovative writing methods in their texts, involving the graphemic level =
(nonstandard orthographies, =E2=80=9Ceye dialect,=E2=80=9D interlinear =
annotations, etc.) or the graphetic level (typographic arrangements =
inspired by visual poetry or calligrams, font change, use of color or =
affine transformations, etc.). We attempt a survey and classification of =
these methods.
------------------------------------------
15:30 CEST
* Kettaneh, Christine. =E2=80=94 Mute Melodies

A short tour through an artist's work that investigates the boundaries =
of language and systems in research-based projects that are =
simultaneously sculptural and performative, and that articulates =
language as both excavated material and excavation technique. Or, =
alternatively, an artist=E2=80=99s journey through everyday matter: soap =
on the wash basin, ants in the garden, sugar on the kitchen table, keys =

------------------------------------------
16:10 CEST
* Wachendorff, Irmi. =E2=80=94 Typographetics of Urban Spaces - the =
Indication of Discourse Types and Genres through Letterforms and Their =
Materiality in Multilingual Urban Spaces

In my ongoing thesis I am looking at social dimensions of typographic =
activity in urban spaces =E2=80=93 as part of the interdisciplinary =
research project =E2=80=9CSigns of the Metropolis: Visual =
Multilingualism in the Ruhr Area=E2=80=9D. In this presentation I will =
focus on how discourse types (such as regulatory, commercial and =
transgressive) as well as certain shop types are indicated by graphetic =
characteristics.
------------------------------------------
16:40 CEST
* Hutto, Megan. =E2=80=94 Press Rightward-Facing Triangle: Metaphor and =
Cross-Cultural Semiotics in Phone Applications

Phone applications are an assumed part of modern life for many people. =
These applications use a small set of symbols to convery the ways that a =
user can interact with the app. As a part of a larger research program =
developing an app for language documentation, this project seeks to test =
if these symbols actually can be used in any cultural context.

17:40 CEST
* Handel, Zev. =E2=80=94 Is Logographic a Valid Script Category? =
Evidence from Historical Borrowing of the Chinese-Character Script

Linguists typically divide symbols in writing systems into two types: =
representing sound alone (like b) and representing meaningful linguistic =
units (like & representing =E2=80=98and=E2=80=99). But the =
categorization of scripts as of one type or the other has been =
challenged. I argue that patterns of borrowing of the Chinese script =
support the traditional view that its characters represent meaningful =
linguistic units.
