professionals for careers in industry, services and research.

*# About the lab *

Created since 2008, the Lab-STICC is a multidisciplinary research=20
laboratory in the field of Information and communication science and=20
technology. Researchers work in a single structure within one central=20
theme: =E2=80=9Cfrom sensor to knowledge=E2=80=9D. The Lab-STICC is a res=
earch unit of=20
the French national center for scientific research (CNRS) involving two=20
universities (Universit=C3=A9 de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest; Universit=C3=
=A9 de=20
Bretagne Sud, Lorient) and three graduate schools of engineering (IMT=20
Atlantique, ENSTA Bretagne and ENIB). Under the title UMR 6285, it is=20
attached to department INS2I and INSIS of the CNRS.
 =C2=A0The Lab-STICC incorporates more than 566 people including 317=20
permanent staff, 206 PhD students and 43 non-permanent positions. The=20
staffs are located over the different institutes on several geographical=20
sites in Brittany: Brest, Lorient, Rennes, Quimper and Vannes.=C2=A0 Over=
 the=20
last five years, Lab-STICC members have authored more than 700 refereed=20
journal papers, 1800 conference communications and 40 patents. Our=20
research leadership has involved strong academic and industrial=20
collaborations with national and international research grants amounting=20
to more than 30 M=E2=82=AC. Lab-STICC members play an important role in t=
he=20
academic training (master, engineering degree) in the field of ICT in=20
western Brittany. Several partner institutions are in charge of these=20
courses. The Transformation41 is a project of a newly created team MOTEL=20
(MOdels and Tools for Enhanced Learning).

*# Transformation41 Project**
*Transformation41 aims at proposing analytics tools to teachers in order=20
to give insights of students=E2=80=99 digital practice, and to support th=
em in=20
transforming pedagogical practices.
The MOTEL team, in collaboration with another team of LIUM laboratory,=20
Laval (France), will focus on proposing adapted dynamic Learning=20
Analytics Dashboards (LAD) (Schwendimann et al. 2016). In previous work=20
conducted during Hubble project, our two teams proposed an User=20
centered=C2=A0 approach for LAD Generation (Dabbebi et al. 2017), we aim =
to=20
reuse and extend in this project. Current results include:
- A participatory-based design tool of Learning Analytics Dashboards=20
(Gilliot et al. 2018), that enable effective capture of user needs;
- LAD models that include user context and aimed decision, and LAD=20
Presentation;
- A prototype that generate dedicated LADs according to those models;
Our objective is to produce dedicated LADs to teachers in the project=20
context, and to extend our models, and related tool and prototype in=20
order to include dynamic evolution of the LAD to support the=20
decision-making process.

*=C2=A0# Job description **
*The proposed work takes place in the frame of the Transformation41=20
project.
Within this project, the applicant will have in charge of:
-=C2=A0 The design and implementation of dynamic LAD models and correspon=
ding=20
LAD Generation tool
- The generation of LADs for Transformation41 teachers.
- The upgrade of the participatory design tool to capture=20
decision-making process needs.
To this purpose, the applicant will be part of a team of eight people,=20
and work in close cooperation of the LIUM team, under the supervision of=20
the project leader at IMT Atlantique.

The applicant should have
- Already worked in the context of Technology-Enhanced Learning Systems=20
and/or Intelligent Computer-Based Systems.
- PhD, preferably in Computer Science with some expertise in : Adaptive=20
Hypermedia, Dashboards generation and/or Software engineering and web=20
