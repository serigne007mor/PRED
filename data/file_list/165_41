CALL FOR PAPERS
The aspiration of SoCPaR 2010 is to bring together worldwide leading resear=
chers, developers,practitioners, and educators interested in advancing the =
state of the art in soft computing and pattern recognition for exchanging k=
nowledge that encompasses a broad range of disciplines among various distin=
ct communities. It is hoped that researchers will bring new prospect for co=
llaboration across disciplines and gain idea facilitating novel breakthroug=
h. The 4-day conference will feature prominent keynote speakers, workshop, =
tutorials, poster and paper presentation in parallel tracks. SoCPaR 2010
invites novel contributions/papers of soft computing and pattern recognitio=
n from fundamental aspects to various practical applications
