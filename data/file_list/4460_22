Subject: [liste-egc] [CfP] 2nd Workshop on Evaluation and Experimental
 Design in Data Mining and Machine Learning (EDML 2020) @ ECML PKDD 2020

<div>*Description*</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>A vital part of proposing new machine learning and data mining approa=
ches is evaluating them empirically to allow an assessment of their capabil=
ities=2E Numerous choices go into setting up such experiments: how to choos=
e the data, how to preprocess them (or not), potential problems associated =
with the selection of datasets, what other techniques to compare to (if any=
), what metrics to evaluate, etc=2E and last but not least how to present a=
nd interpret the results=2E Learning how to make those choices on-the-job, =
often by copying the evaluation protocols used in the existing literature, =
can easily lead to the development of problematic habits=2E Numerous, albei=
t scattered, publications have called attention to those questions and have=
 occasionally called into question published results, or the usability of p=
ublished methods=2E At a time of intense discussions about a reproducibilit=
y crisis in natural, social, and life sciences, and conferences such as SIG=
MOD, KDD, and ECML/PKDD encouraging researchers to make their work as repro=
ducible as possible, we therefore feel that it is important to bring resear=
chers together, and discuss those issues on a fundamental level=2E</div>

<div>A related issue is directly related to the first choice mentioned abo=
ve: even the best-designed experiment carries only limited information if t=
he underlying data are lacking=2E We therefore also want to discuss questio=
ns related to the availability of data, whether they are reliable, diverse,=
 and whether they correspond realistic and/or challenging problem settings=
=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>*Topics*</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In this workshop, we mainly solicit contributions that discuss those =
questions on a fundamental level, take stock of the state-of-the-art, offer=
 theoretical arguments, or take well-argued positions, as well as actual ev=
aluation papers that offer new insights, e=2Eg=2E question published result=
s, or shine the spotlight on the characteristics of existing benchmark data=
 sets=2E</div>

<div>As such, topics include, but are not limited to:<br/>
- Benchmark datasets for data mining tasks: are they diverse/realistic/cha=
llenging?<br/>
- Impact of data quality (redundancy, errors, noise, bias, imbalance, =2E=
=2E=2E) on qualitative evaluation<br/>
- Propagation/amplification of data quality issues on the data mining resu=
lts (also interplay between data and algorithms)<br/>
- Evaluation of unsupervised data mining (dilemma between novelty and vali=
dity)<br/>
- Evaluation measures<br/>
- (Automatic) data quality evaluation tools: What are the aspects one shou=
ld check before starting to apply algorithms to given data?<br/>
- Issues around runtime evaluation (algorithm vs=2E implementation, depend=
ency on hardware, algorithm parameters, dataset characteristics)<br/>
- Design guidelines for crowd-sourced evaluations</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The workshop will feature a mix of invited speakers, a number of acce=
pted presentations with ample time for questions since those contributions =
will be less technical, and more philosophical in nature, and a panel discu=
ssion on the current state, and the areas that most urgently need improveme=
nt, as well as recommendation to achieve those improvements=2E Workshop sub=
missions will be published in the CEUR-WS workshop series=2E An important o=
bjective of this workshop is a document synthesizing these discussions that=
 we intend to publish at a more prominent venue=2E</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>*Submission*</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Papers should be submitted as PDF, using the Springer LNCS style, ava=
ilable at https://www=2Espringer=2Ecom/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-=
proceedings-guidelines=2E Submissions should be limited to ten pages and su=
bmitted via Easychair at https://easychair=2Eorg/conferences/?conf=3Dedml20=
=2E</div>

<div>Papers will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Commit=
tee on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity=
=2E Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper is accepted =
at least one author should present the paper at the workshop=2E Accepted pa=
pers will be published after the workshop with &nbsp;CEUR-WS or Springer=2E=
