Subject: [liste-egc] CFP Extended: Messaging and Web of Data: Private meets
 Public (and vice-versa) workshop at WWW2012 (Lyon, France)

!Deadline Extended!

******************************************************************
*Messaging and Web of Data: Private meets Public (and vice-versa)*
******************************************************************
International Workshop in conjunction
with the 21st World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2012)
April 16 (afternoon), 2012 - Lyon, France

http://email2012.ui.sav.sk/

*Important Dates*

Submission Deadline:     February 15, 2012 (Extended)
Acceptance notification: March 4, 2012
Camera-ready submission: March 15, 2012
Workshop date:           April 16, 2012

*Workshop objective and goals*

The growing amount of public available data on the WWW is a new
opportunity to improve Messaging systems (e.g. Email, Social Media,
Instant Messaging) in multiple forms, such as messages content,
processing (classification, etc.) and presentation. This workshop is
dedicated to explore how public web data, such as identities, agendas,
LinkedData, social networks or various information published on the
web can meet private messaging data (semi-structured headers,
information extracted from emails, footers such as signatures, etc.)
to bring new insight for users, and prevent error or abuse.
Reciprocally, messages can become public (think about public email
archives, leaked email datasets, Twitter timelines, etc.), but
sometimes to implement web standards to be efficiently identified,
distributed and linked. This private/public duality and versality,
applied to messages in general (and especially to email), is the basis
of this workshop, which goes beyond technical aspects and aims at
exploring impacts on users' practices, interfaces and trust.
In this workshop edition, we want to particularly explore 1) how to
preserve privacy in the context strictly private messages (Email,
Direct Messages) and public data (such as open linked data) by
minimizing information disclosure, and 2) the integration of social
media (Twitter, Facebook) with conventional messaging systems (Email,
forums) in an everyday use, and its impact on data acquisation and
organisation.

*Topics*

Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Archives exploration and analysis: Email mailing lists, web
archives, structured datasets, email archives as knowledge base or
business intelligence data source.
- Usage studies: usage patterns, behaviors, information overload.
- Technical impact: infrastructures, protocols stacks.
- Web standards: embedding web standards in messages, semantics,
microformats, LinkedData and its integration and use in messages.
- Conversations: quotes, threads, sentiment/discourse/opinion
analysis, dialog analysis, conversation graph.
- Social: identities, institution and individual reputation,
folksonomies, collaboration and social media integration.
- HCI and visualization: interfaces, novel interactions, visual
analysis,recommendation.
- Natural Language Processing: applications of NLP technologies,
message understanding, topic modeling, message summarization.
- Information Extraction: methods and techniques to extract sensitive/
personal information from email, entities disambiguation and
coreferences.
- Interactions on the Web: instant messaging, RSS feeds, blogging,
social network, tweets.
- Security and privacy issues: usable privacy, trust, phishing, abuse.

*Paper format and submission*

Submissions should report new (unpublished) research results or
ongoing research. Submissions can be 3-4 pages for short position/
experience papers, posters and interactive demos. 6-8 pages for full
