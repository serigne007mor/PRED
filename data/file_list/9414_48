AIM AND SCOPE

Environmental and more generally geo-spatial information is now provided 
by crowdsourcing but also by public administrations in the context of 
the open data policies. Analyses of such data are still challenging. 
Firstly because of their heterogeneity (structural, semantic, spatial 
and temporal), and secondly because of the difficulty in choosing the 
"best" knowledge discovery process to apply, according to the needs of 
the experts in the field. This special session aims at discussing and 
assessing some of these strategies covering all or part of the issues 
mentioned above, from a theoretical or experimental point of view.

TOPICS

- Pre and Post Data processing
- Data Quality, Result Evaluation
- Data Mining or Data Warehousing Applications
- Text-Mining
- Visual Analytics
- KDD real use-cases
dedicated to environmental and geo-spatial Data

PAPER SUBMISSION

- Papers should be submitted by DSAA submission site 
(http://dsaa2015.lip6.fr/?page_id=77) choosing Special Session on 
"Environmental and geo-spatial data analytics (EnGeoData)" before 18 
May,2015 (PST).
-  Conference paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of nine 
(9) pages, in the IEEE 2-column format (see the IEEE Proceedings Author 
Guidelines: 
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
).
- All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the 
basis of technical quality, relevance to conference topics of interest, 
originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations 
must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be 
adjusted to preserve author anonymity.
- Accepted conference papers will be published in the conference 
proceedings by IEEE and included into the IEEE Xplore Digital Library 
and will be submitted for EI indexing through INSPEC by IEEE.
