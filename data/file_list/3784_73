The University Clermont Auvergne (UCA) in Clermont-Ferrand, France is offer=
ing a CPJ position (Junior Professor Chair) that will be available by Septe=
mber 2023.=20

Junior Professor Chairs (JPC) correspond to a new program in France that of=
fers highly qualified young researchers an opportunity to conduct quality r=
esearch through the creation of a dedicated environment (material and finan=
cial). They provide a real professional leverage that can lead to a permane=
nt position as a full professor within 5 years, while also promoting the es=
tablishment of a genuine international synergy with the stakeholders involv=
ed.=20

The selected candidate will be involved in research activities as part of t=
he LIMOS ( [ http://limos.fr/ | limos.fr ] ), a CNRS laboratory, and will a=
lso be in charge of teaching at the engineering school ISIMA of Clermont Au=
vergne INP ( [ https://www.isima.fr/ | https://www.isima.fr ] , [ https://w=
ww.clermont-auvergne-inp.fr/ | https://www.clermont-auvergne-inp.fr ] ).=20

This chair aims to develop a research activity around models and algorithms=
 for AI by placing it within a data-knowledge continuum. At the heart of AI=
 lies the algorithmics of learning. Beyond the design of new methods, parti=
cularly in a weakly supervised context, several research directions are bei=
ng explored, such as explainability. Defining effective learning methods ba=
sed on optimization techniques and game theory is also a promising research=
 target. Finally, the question of the formal representation of knowledge op=
ens the way to research on interactions between symbolic AI approaches and =
learning from data.=20
This ambitious and unifying project lies at the intersection of several the=
mes of the LIMOS and connects with those of other laboratories in the area.=
 The research questions are anchored in the "Data" cross-cutting program of=
 the ISite CAP2025 and will draw on the application domains of the ISite's =
International Research Centers.=20

The teaching service will be 64 hours per year and will focus on the algori=
thmics of Artificial Intelligence and its applications.=20

For this specific position at UCA, the first phase of the contract is for f=
ive years during which the successful candidate will receive funding of 200=
,000 euros for their research activities, including the recruitment of a do=
ctoral and postdoctoral student. The salary during this period will be 3,44=
3.50 euros per month (before deductions for taxes) which makes it around 2,=
600 euros per month (after taxes).=20
At the end of the five-year period, and after a successful evaluation by a =
tenure commission, the CPJ can lead to a permanent position as a full profe=
ssor.=20


Additional informations regarding the application procedure and schedule wi=
ll be communicated later.=20
