RCIS 2013 is a conference of RCIS Conference Series and is sponsored by
IEEE France section. This year, RCIS will be co-=ADlocated with the 31st
French Conference on Information Systems (INFORSID 2013), a prominent
French scientific event  sharing with RCIS the interest on the field of
Information Science.


SCOPE AND TOPICS
The Seventh International Conference on RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION
SCIENCE aims at providing an international forum for scientists,
researchers, engineers and developers from a wide range of information
science areas to exchange ideas and approaches in this evolving field.
While presenting research findings and state-of-art solutions, you are
especially invited to share experiences on new research challenges in these
main topics:

    - Information System Engineering
    - Requirements Engineering
    - Database and Information System Integration
    - Data Management
    - Information Search and Discovery
    - Software Testing
    - Human-Computer Interaction
    - Web Information Systems
    - Grid Computing and Cloud Computing
    - Social Computing
    - User Centred Approaches
    - Decision Information Systems
    - Knowledge Management
    - Knowledge Discovery from Data
    - Business Process Analysis, Modelling and Design
    - Business Applications
    - Information Security Risk
    - Information and Value Management

Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors
should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related topics are also
acceptable, provided they fit in one of the conference main topics.


CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS AND BEST PAPERS
Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review for
other conferences or journals will not be considered for publication at
RCIS 2013. Authors are invited to submit papers in English. Each submitted
paper will have to be associated to one of the four following categories.

    - Technical solution papers present solutions that are novel or
significantly improve existing solutions. A technical solution paper must
include a preliminary validation of the proposed solution. Results must be
stated clearly enough so that it is possible to validate them in later
research (12 pages).
    - Evaluation papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate
proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e. by empirical studies,
experiments, case studies, simulations, mathematical proofs, etc. The
research method must be sound and appropriate (12 pages).
    - Industrial practice and experience papers present problems or
challenges encountered in practice, relate success and failure stories, or
report on industrial practice. The practice must be clearly described and
its context must be given (12 pages).
    - Doctoral Papers are papers submitted by doctoral students only and
are related to research work in progress (6 pages).
    - Poster papers as well as Demo papers aim to gather researchers in a
forum to showcase their work and obtain feedback on on-going research from
knowledgeable conference attendees (2 pages).

The submission site address is
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drcis2013

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of them
will register to the conference and present the paper. Only papers that
have been presented by their authors during the conference will be
published in IEEE Proceedings.

Authors of papers that obtain the highest marks in the reviewing process
will be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue of the
International Journal of Information System Modeling and Design (IGI), to
appear at the end of 2014 (vol. 5 issue 4).

Since Proceedings will be published with the IEEE Conference Publications
Program through IEEE Xplore digital library, paper submissions must be
formatted using the IEEE 2-column format (see Conference Templates,
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.htm=
l).

They should be limited to a maximum of 12 pages and be submitted in PDF
format. Please use the IEEE PDF eXpress tool (http://www.pdf-express.org/)
to convert your source file into IEEE Xplore compliant PDF File or to check
if your own PDF file is IEEE Xplore compliant. IEEE PDF eXpress is a free
service to IEEE conferences, allowing their authors to make IEEE
Xplore-compatible PDFs (Conversion function) or to check PDFs that authors
have made themselves for IEEE Xplore compatibility (PDF Check function).
The conference ID for IEEE PDF eXpress tool will be provided soon on the
RCIS 2013 web site. It is important to note that submitting a file to IEEE
PDF eXpress is only for creation of a compliant PDF file, you must still
submit your final paper through online submission.
