Subject: [liste-egc] 2nd Call for Papers: 22nd International Conference on
 Conceptual Structures 2016

Dear colleague, apologies if you receive multiple copies of this message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call for Papers:

22nd International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS 2016

Graph-based Modeling of Conceptual Structures

********************************************************************************************
5th to 7th July, 2016, Annecy, France

Conference web site:www.irit.fr/ICCS2016/

Co-located: 9th International Conference on Formal Ontology in 
Information Systems (FOIS) 2016
********************************************************************************************

The International Conferences on Conceptual Structures (ICCS) focus on 
the formal analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge with 
applications to artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and 
related areas of computer science. The ICCS conferences evolved from a 
series of seven annual workshops on conceptual graphs, starting with an 
informal gathering hosted by John F. Sowa in 1986. Recently, graph-based 
knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are getting more 
and more attention. The aim of the ICCS 2016 conference is to build upon 
its long standing expertise in graph-based KRR and focus on providing 
modelling, formal and application results of graph-based systems.

ICCS 2016 will be co-located with FOIS 2016, held in Annecy, in the 
Polytech building at the campus of the University of Savoie.

The conference welcomes contributions that address graph-based 
representation and reasoning paradigms (e.g. Bayesian Networks (BNs), 
Semantic Networks (SNs), RDF(S), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept 
Analysis (FCA), CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, Graph Databases, Diagrams, etc.) from 
a modelling, theoretical and application viewpoint:

- Modelling results will investigate concrete real world needs for 
graph-based representation, how certain use cases are of interest to the 
graph community, how using graphs can bring added (business) value, what 
kind of graph representation is needed for a given case, etc.

- Technical results will include fundamental graph theory based results 
for novel structures for representation, extensions of existing 
structures for added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms 
for reasoning, reasoning explanation, etc.

- Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to 
demonstrate the benefits of the graph-based proposed solutions in the 
context of the use case studied with respect to other possible solutions.

The main research topics are:

- Knowledge Management,
- Knowledge Architectures,
- Reasoning under Inconsistency,
- Knowledge Representation and Uncertainty,
- Contextual Logic,
- Constraint Satisfaction,
- Decision Making,
- Argumentation,
- Ontologies,
- Semantic Web,
- Web of Data,
- Web 2.0,
- Conceptual Knowledge Acquisition,
- Data Mining,
- Text Mining,
- Natural Language Processing,
- Linguistics,
- Metaphoric, Cultural or Semiotic Considerations,
- Resource Allocation and Agreement Technologies.

Submission Information

We invite scientific papers of up to fourteen pages and posters of up to 
three pages.

For each paper, an abstract must be submitted by January 28, 2016, with 
full papers being due on February 4, 2016. Posters do not require 
advanced abstract submission and should be submitted by March 24, 2016.

Papers and posters must be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS style 
guidelines and not exceed the page limit. The submission is to be done 
via EasyChair:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs20161

All paper submissions will be refereed and authors will have the 
opportunity to respond to reviewers’ comments during the rebuttal phase. 
Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings, 
published by Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.

Poster submissions will also be refereed but will not be included in the 
conference proceedings.

At least one author of each accepted paper or poster must register for 
the conference and present the paper or poster there.

Proceedings will be submitted for indexation by DBLP.
