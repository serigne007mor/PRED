http://storify.com/pa_muller/phd-thesis-proposal-for-2013-2016#publicize


Scientific Objective
Meta-modeling is a branch of software engineering concerned with
analysis and synthesis of models (descriptions of real world phenomena).
The overall goal of data-mining is to extract information from a data
sets and transform it into
understandable structures for further use.

The scientific objective of this PhD thesis proposal is to investigate
how meta-modeling and
data-mining might complement themselves.

Application Field
MIPS has been involved in several tracking campaigns within the
Internet, and has gathered huge amounts of behavioral data which will
serve as experimental ground for this PhD thesis.
=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=9D was chosen in 2006 as Time magazine =E2=80=9CPerson o=
f the Year=E2=80=9D. Since
then, on-line presence
of individual never stopped to grow. Data generated from on-line
interactions continues
to explode: social platform, e-commerce, on-line video game, blogs, etc.
The challenge is to turn the raw data collected into actionable
insights.
New approaches, tools and methods are now needed to help users to master
they on-line identity, and for marketers to benefit from this great
amount of information to gain competitive edges.
The application field for this PhD thesis might therefore be online
marketing.

Prerequisites
=E2=80=A2 Applicants must have a degree in Computer Science, or in a related
study, with excellent results
=E2=80=A2 Applicants might have an experience in either meta-modeling or
data-mining
=E2=80=A2 Applicants must be able to demonstrate interest in scientific res=
earch
=E2=80=A2 Applicants must have proven writing skills in English (Knowledge =

Context
The design of efficient methods for combinatorial optimization is a key
issue for many industrial sectors (automotive, aerospace, broadcasting,
etc.). Indeed, more and more efficient heuristics and exact methods have
been proposed in recent years, enabling the resolution of many difficult
problems.
Metaheuristics, such as evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm
optimization and ant colony optimization, have been successfully used to
solve many hard problems. It is an interesting approach to tackle
high-dimensional problems. In the literature, a large and
well-diversified set of metaheuristics has been proposed over the years,
enabling the resolution of a wide range of problems.
To take advantage of this diversity, hybrid metaheuristics have been
proposed. In this new class of algorithms, a smart combination of
different optimization methods is used. Such hybridizations can be used
to take advantage of strengths from different algorithms. Several
examples in the literature show that hybrid metaheuristics can provide a
more robust and efficient problem-solving, especially for real-world and
large-scale problems.
However, this kind of hybridizations is mainly achieved statically and
the parameter setting is performed experimentally. To overcome this
limitation, we first need to define a proper set of hybridization
parameters (how to combine two approaches, when to instantiate a
particular approach, etc.). We wish through this thesis to answer these
questions, which can help in the design of hybrid metaheuristics, and
lead in term to advanced adaptive hybrid metaheuristics (using dynamic
and adaptive hybridization).
Recently, graphics processing units (GPU) have emerged as a new popular
support for massively parallel computing, mainly thanks to the
publication of the CUDA development toolkit. The algorithms developed
during this thesis will exploit a GPU cluster (a computer cluster in
which each node is equipped with a GPU), through the use of GPGPU. This
cluster provides the significant computing power required by these
algorithms, especially if they are used to solve problems that require
high computational capabilities.
Objective
Development of a library of massively parallel hybrid metaheuristics for
single-objective/multi-objective optimization.

Work plan
- First step: consists in
=E2=80=A2 studying the evolution of the search process of hybrid metaheuris=
tics
;
=E2=80=A2 extracting useful information that will help us hybridizing
metaheuristics.

- Second step: consists in studying two problems currently treated in
our team: the design of an electric motor and the structural resolution
of new zeolites. The goal of this study is to determine and propose a
classification of the different parameters to be optimized.

- Third step: consists in integrating the knowledge acquired on these
problems in order to refine the exploration process used to find better
solutions.

Working Conditions
The developed algorithms will be validated using a GPU cluster composed
of 12 computers equipped with GTX 680 cards. This cluster is funded by
the Scientific Council of University of Haute Alsace.

Prerequisites
=E2=80=A2 The applicant must hold a Master or equivalent in Computer Scienc=
e or
Applied Mathematics;
=E2=80=A2 He should have a strong background in GPU programming, metaheuris=
tics
and optimization;
=E2=80=A2 The applicant must speak English fluently ((Knowledge of French i=
s not
a prerequisite, work will be conducted in English);
=E2=80=A2 He should have good programming skills (programming language: C++=
).

Application
Candidates should submit the following documents:
=E2=80=A2 Motivation letter;
=E2=80=A2 Curriculum vitae;
=E2=80=A2 List of publications (if available);
=E2=80=A2 Copies of diplomas;
=E2=80=A2 University transcript.

ity, hybrid metaheuristics have been<br>





proposed. In this new class of algorithms, a smart combination of<br>differ=
ent optimization methods is used. Such hybridizations can be used<br>to tak=
e advantage of strengths from different algorithms. Several<br>examples in =
the literature show that hybrid metaheuristics can provide a<br>





more robust and efficient problem-solving, especially for real-world and<br=
>large-scale problems.<br>However, this kind of hybridizations is mainly ac=
hieved statically and<br>the parameter setting is performed experimentally.=
 To overcome this<br>





limitation, we first need to define a proper set of hybridization<br>parame=
ters (how to combine two approaches, when to instantiate a<br>particular ap=
proach, etc.). We wish through this thesis to answer these<br>questions, wh=
ich can help in the design of hybrid metaheuristics, and<br>





lead in term to advanced adaptive hybrid metaheuristics (using dynamic<br>a=
nd adaptive hybridization).<br>Recently, graphics processing units (GPU) ha=
ve emerged as a new popular<br>support for massively parallel computing, ma=
inly thanks to the<br>





publication of the CUDA development toolkit. The algorithms developed<br>du=
ring this thesis will exploit a GPU cluster (a computer cluster in<br>which=
 each node is equipped with a GPU), through the use of GPGPU. This<br>




cluster provides the significant computing power required by these<br>
algorithms, especially if they are used to solve problems that require<br>h=
igh computational capabilities.<br>Objective<br>Development of a library of=
 massively parallel hybrid metaheuristics for<br>single-objective/multi-obj=
ective optimization.<br>





<br>Work plan<br>- First step: consists in<br>=E2=80=A2 studying the evolut=
ion of the search process of hybrid metaheuristics<br>;<br>=E2=80=A2 extrac=
ting useful information that will help us hybridizing<br>metaheuristics.<br=
><br>- Second step: consists in studying two problems currently treated in<=
br>





our team: the design of an electric motor and the structural resolution<br>=
of new zeolites. The goal of this study is to determine and propose a<br>cl=
assification of the different parameters to be optimized.<br><br>- Third st=
ep: consists in integrating the knowledge acquired on these<br>





problems in order to refine the exploration process used to find better<br>=
solutions.<br><br>Working Conditions<br>The developed algorithms will be va=
lidated using a GPU cluster composed<br>of 12 computers equipped with GTX 6=
80 cards. This cluster is funded by<br>
