Subject: [liste-egc] Special Issue on Deep Learning and Knowledge Graphs in
 Semantic Web Journal

***********************************
Special Issue on Deep Learning and Knowledge Graphs in Semantic Web =
Journal
Web: =
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/call-papers-special-issue-deep-le=
arning-and-knowledge-graphs=20
Deadline: Submission deadline: 1st of February 2021. Papers submitted =
before the deadline will be reviewed upon receipt.
***********************************

Over the past years there has been a rapid growth in the use and the =
importance of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) along with their application to =
many important tasks. KGs are large networks of real-world entities =
described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to =
each other. On the other hand, Deep Learning has also become an =
important area of research, achieving important breakthroughs in various =
research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image =
Processing. Moreover, in recent years Deep Learning methods have been =
combined with KGs. For example: 1) knowledge representation learning =
techniques aimed at embedding entities and relations in a KG into a =
dense and low-dimensional semantic space, 2) relation extraction =
techniques, aimed at extracting facts and relations from text and needed =
to construct KGs, 3) entity linking techniques, aimed at completing KGs, =
4) using KGs as an additional prior for image recognition, etc.

In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical =
that the communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP =
join their forces in order to develop more effective algorithms and =
applications. This special issue aims to reinforce the relationships =
between these communities and foster interdisciplinary research in the =
areas of KG, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

deadline will be reviewed upon receipt.

********************
Author Guidelines
********************

Submissions shall be made through the Semantic Web journal website at =
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net. Prospective authors must take =
notice of the submission guidelines posted at =
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors.

We welcome four main types of submissions: (i) full research papers, =
(ii) reports on tools and systems, (iii) application reports, and (iv) =
survey articles. The description of the submission types is posted at =
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors#types. While there is no =
upper limit, paper length must be justified by content.

Note that you need to request an account on the website for submitting a =
paper. Please indicate in the cover letter that it is for the "Deep =
Learning and Knowledge Graphs" special issue. All manuscripts will be =
reviewed based on the SWJ open and transparent review policy and will be =
made available online during the review process.

Also note that the Semantic Web journal is open access.
