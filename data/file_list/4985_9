A PhD scholarship is available at Universit=C3=A9 de Toulouse - IRIT Lab
Topic of the thesis : Deep Learning and Information Retrieval
Application Deadline : 31/03/2021
Location : IRIT-LAB
This PhD thesis is related to deep learning-based information retrieval. =
Several =E2=80=9Cdeep learning=E2=80=9D models have been proposed in IR. =
Most of them were often adapted from those proposed for vision, NLP =
(Natural Language Processing) or speech recognition, to respond to =
different IR tasks. However, it is well known that these adaptations =
have not obtained same success, in terms of performance than those =
observed in these related fields (vision, speech, audio and TAL). One of =
the reasons of this "failure" comes from the specificity of the IR task, =
in particular, if we compare it to tasks relating to text matching in =
NLP (see [Guo et al 2016, Onal et al. 2018]). Indeed, in IR, through =
document-query matching, we attempt to model the notion of relevance of =
the document w.r.t a query, i.e. the utiity, usefulness of the document =
content to the user information need expressed by a few key words. We =
are not trying to compute a semantic proximity between a few words of =
the query and a document that can contain tens or even thousands of =
words. However, this is precisely what the majority of neural models =
attempt to model in the NLP tasks, including text representations =
learning to match two texts, identify the semantics of a text or infer =
semantic relationships between two pieces of text, etc.

More recently, Transformers models, ala BERT, used precisely to model =
the language, have been successfully used with huge gain in terms of =
performances in both NLP and IR tasks. The best question-answering (Q-R) =
systems performances on SQUAD data ) are all based on BERT (or its =
extension). One of the open questions concerns the explicability of =
these models. Indeed, behind this black box we need to understand what =
is actually learned, what represent the different layers.

It is precisely the main topic of this PhD. It's about opening the box =
black models of "Deep models" and attemp to understand and identify the =
factors that are actually learned by these models in the case of the IR =
task. We will particularly focus on "Transformers" ala BERT. Traditional =
IR has its own relevance factors such as term frequency, document =
length, term position, etc., that are widely used by theoretical IR =
models (the vector space model, probabilistic model, ...). The first =
goal of this PhD to build a framework allowing to check whether these =
classical factors are learned or not and then, and the second goal is to =
extract (identify) factors, not necessarily known in the IR world and =
propose ways (model/approach) to inject them in the =E2=80=9Cclassic=E2=80=
=9D models of IR. This, of very important in IR, since it will overcome =
the learning phase, especially for "poor" areas in learning data.
