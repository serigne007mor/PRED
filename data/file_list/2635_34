** INTRODUCTION **

HistoInformatics2021 - the 6th International Workshop on
Computational History will be held on September 30th, 2021 in
conjunction with The ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital
Libraries (JCDL2021). The HistoInformatics workshop series brings
together researchers in the historical disciplines, computer science
and associated disciplines as well as the cultural heritage sector.
Historians, like other humanists, show keen interests in
computational approaches to the study and processing of digitized
sources (usually text, images, audio). In computer science,
experimental tools and methods stand the challenge to be validated
regarding their relevance for real-world questions and applications.
The HistoInformatics workshop series is designed to bring
researchers in both fields together, to discuss best practices as
well as possible future collaborations. Traditionally, historical
research is based on the hermeneutic investigation of preserved
records and artifacts to provide a reliable account of the past and
to discuss different hypotheses. Alongside this hermeneutic approach
historians have always been interested in translating primary
sources into data and used methods, often borrowed from the social
sciences, to analyze them. A new wealth of digitized historical
documents have however opened up completely new challenges for the
computer-assisted analysis of e.g. large text or image corpora.

Historians can greatly benefit from the advances of computer and
information sciences which are dedicated to the processing,
organization, and analysis of such data. New computational
techniques can be applied to help verify and validate historical
assumptions. We call this approach HistoInformatics, analogous to
Bioinformatics and ChemoInformatics which have respectively proposed
new research trends in biology and chemistry. The main topics of the
workshop are (1) support for historical research and analysis in
general through the application of computer science theories or
technologies, (2) analysis and re-use of historical texts, (3)
visualizations of historical data, (4) provision of access to
historical knowledge.

Our objective is to provide for the two different research
communities a place to meet and exchange ideas and to facilitate
discussion. We hope the workshop will result in a survey of current
problems and potential solutions, with particular focus on exploring
opportunities for collaboration and interaction of researchers
working on various subareas within Computer Science and History
Sciences.

** THEMES AND TOPICS **

We invite papers from a wide range of topics which are of relevance
for history, the cultural heritage sector and the humanities in
general. Besides original research papers, we also invite
submissions of diverse types including position papers, project
descriptions, or demo type papers. The workshop targets researchers
who work on the intersections of history and computer science. The
papers on the following and related topics (but not limited to) are
especially welcome:

- Natural language processing and text analytics applied to
historical documents
- Analysis of longitudinal document collections
- Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis
- Search and retrieval in document archives and historical
collections, associative search
- Causal relationship discovery based on historical resources
- Named entity recognition and disambiguation
- Entity relationship extraction, detecting and resolving historical
references in text
- Finding analogical entities over time
- Network Analysis
- Computational linguistics for old texts
- Analysis of language change over time
- Modelling evolution of entities and relationships over time
- Automatic multimedia document dating
- Simulating and recreating the past course of actions, social
relations, motivations, figurations
- Handling uncertain and fragmentary text and image data
- Mining Wikipedia for historical data
- OCR and transcription old texts
- Effective interfaces for searching, browsing or visualizing
historical data collections
- Studies on collective memory
- Studying and modeling forgetting and remembering processes
- Estimating credibility of historical findings
- Epistemologies in the Humanities and Computer Science
- Computer Vision applied to historical image collections


** SUBMISSION INFORMATION **

Full paper submissions are limited to 8 pages, while short paper
submissions should be no more than 4 pages (including bibliography).
Submissions need to be:

formatted according to Easychair paper formatting guidelines
(https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors).
original and have not been submitted for publication elsewhere.
submitted in English in PDF format at the workshop’s Easychair page
(https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=hi20210#.
submissions do not need to be anonymized.

There is no requirement of anonymity so it is up to authors if they
wish to reveal or conceal their names in submissions. Submissions
will be evaluated by at least three different reviewers with
backgrounds in Computer Science and History. The accepted papers
will be published on CEUR Workshop Proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org/).

Selected papers from the workshop will be invited to submit to the
special issue on HistoInformatics
(https://jdmdh.episciences.org/page/histoinformatics) at the
Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities
(https://jdmdh.episciences.org/).


Papers should be submitted using
