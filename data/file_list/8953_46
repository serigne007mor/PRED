LMCE 2014 # First International Workshop on Learning over Multiple Contexts=
 @ ECML 2014

Generalization and reuse of machine learning models over multiple contexts

A workshop held in conjunction with the ECML PKDD 2014, Nancy, France, 15-1=
9 September 2014

http://www.dsic.upv.es/~flip/LMCE2014/

Adaptive reuse of learnt knowledge is of critical importance in the majorit=
y of knowledge-intensive application areas, particularly when the context i=
n which the learnt model operates can be expected to vary from training to =
deployment. In machine learning this has been studied, for example, in rela=
tion to variations in class and cost skew in (binary) classification, leadi=
ng to the development of tools such as ROC analysis to adjust decision thre=
sholds to operating conditions concerning class and cost skew. More recentl=
y, considerable effort has been devoted to research on transfer learning, d=
omain adaptation, and related approaches.

Given that the main business of predictive machine learning is to generalis=
e from training to deployment, there is clearly scope for developing a gene=
ral notion of operating context. Without such a notion, a model predicting =
sales in Prague for this week may perform poorly in Nancy for next Wednesda=
y. The operating context has changed in terms of location as well as resolu=
tion. While a given predictive model may be sufficient and highly specialis=
ed for one particular operating context, it may not perform well in other c=
ontexts. If sufficient training data for the new context is available it mi=
ght be feasible to retrain a new model; however, this is generally not a go=
od use of resources, and one would expect it to be more cost-effective to l=
earn one general, versatile model that effectively generalizes over multipl=
e and possibly previously unseen contexts.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together people working in areas relat=
ed to versatile models and model reuse over multiple contexts. Given the ad=
vances made in recent years on specific approaches such as transfer learnin=
g, an attempt to start developing an overarching theory is now feasible and=
 timely, and can be expected to generate considerable interest from the mac=
hine learning community. Papers are solicited in all areas relating to mode=
l reuse and model generalization including the following areas:

* transfer learning
* data shift and concept drift
* domain adaptation
* transductive learning
* multi-task learning
* ROC analysis and cost-sensitive learning
* background knowledge
* relational learning
* context-aware applications
* incomplete information, abduction
* meta-learning

=3D=3D=3D Submission of Papers =3D=3D=3D

We welcome submissions describing work in progress as well as more mature w=
ork related to learning over multiple contexts. Submissions should be betwe=
en 6 and 16 pages in the same format as the main conference (LNAI). Authors=
 of accepted papers will be asked to prepare a poster, and selected authors=
 will be given the opportunity of a plenary presentation during the worksho=
p.

Submission website: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlmce2014

After the workshop, contributing authors will be invited to submit a paper =
to a special issue of the Machine Learning journal dedicated to the topic o=
f the workshop.
