-- Abstract --

Collaboration between data producers and consumers is a key challenge
for facilitating the evolution of the LOD cloud into a participative
and updatable LOD cloud. Semantic Web Collaborative Spaces aim to make
open data producers and consumers working together to enhance and
maintain linked data and contents, and improve linked data quality.
These collaborative spaces include social semantic frameworks such as
crowdsourcing tools, semantic wikis, semantic social networks,
semantic microblogs; they have the mission to bring together human and
software agents in order to foster knowledge =C2=ADintensive collaboration,
content creation and management, annotated multimedia collection
management, social knowledge diffusion and formalizing, and more
generally speaking ontology=C2=AD oriented content management life=C2=ADcyc=
le.

-- Goal and Motivations --

Even after the early success of Linked Open Data initiatives, there
remain significant bottlenecks and technical limitations that prevent
the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud from realizing its maximum potential
- many that could be alleviated through the use of collaborative
spaces. First, the LOD cloud is comprised of a large number of
datasets published by autonomous data providers. Linked data is
essentially read-only and most collaborative tasks of cleaning,
enriching and reasoning are not dynamically available, i.e., there is
no way to merge data or detect, on-the-fly, if faulty resources are
going to be integrated with data in the LOD cloud. Second, open data
are fragmented in multiple datasets, which have high level of semantic
heterogeneity, i.e., many open (dynamic) data are currently not
available in linked data formats. Thus, transferring continuously data
to the LOD cloud is a complex and costly process; additionally, linked
data can be outdated. Finally, devices that produce data dynamically
respond to different technologies and may not respect Web-based
protocols, e.g., sensors commonly utilize a wide variety of
communication protocols. All these drawbacks inhibit data producers
and consumers to work together to better manage resources. Unless
these limitations are addressed, the LOD cloud will experience the
following threats and limitations: Emergence of a fork of open,
time-dependent data and federation of linked data infrastructures,
dividing resources and communities. Low quality and limited
availability of data may result in dissatisfied data consumers, and
consequently unsupported investments of data producers. Collaboration
between data producers and consumers is a key challenge for overcoming
the previous drawbacks, and facilitating the evolution of the LOD
cloud into a participative and updatable LOD cloud. Semantic Web
Collaborative Spaces aim to make open data producers and consumers
working together to enhance and maintain linked data and contents, and
improve linked data quality. These collaborative spaces include social
semantic frameworks such as crowdsourcing tools, semantic wikis,
semantic social networks, semantic microblogs; they have the mission
to bring together human and software agents in order to foster
knowledge-intensive collaboration, content creation and management,
annotated multimedia collection management, social knowledge diffusion
and formalizing, and more generally speaking ontology-oriented content
management life-cycle.

-- Topics--

Contributions to this workshop will address one or more of the following
topics:

* Collaborative data sharing with SWCS:
     Change management, truth maintenance, versioning, and undoing semantic
changes.
     Producing and Consuming Writable Linked Open Data.
     Analyzing and Mining Writable Linked Open Data.
     SWCS frameworks to enhance Linked Data Quality.
     Transactional updates on Linked Open Data.
* Representing and reasoning on semantics in social web platforms:
    Reconciling formal semantics and social semantics.
    Semantic social network analysis, community detection and community
building.
    Analyses of semantic wiki contributors and their contributions.
    Combining, transforming, translating formal and informal knowledge.
    Coping with disagreement, inconsistencies.
    Semantics in social/human computing, and vice versa.
    Connecting knowledge and social interaction from asynchronous
interactions to real-time/multi-synchronous interactions in SWCS.
    Optimizing, distributing, and scaling SWCS.
    Managing and exploiting the emergence of models and their semantics.
* Interacting with and within SWCS:
    Browsing, navigating, visualizing.
    Editing Linked Open Data, schemas, rules, etc.
    Ergonomics of SWCS, interaction design and usability studies.
    Object-centered sociality, knowledge-centered sociality.
    Overcoming entrance barriers and giving incentives for contributing.
    Provenance, traceability, permissions, trust, licensing, access
control, privacy.
    Making formal knowledge accessible, social knowledge evaluation.
    Mobile and multimodal accesses to SWCS.
* Return on experience and applications of semantic web collaborative
spaces:
    SWCS platforms in e-science,  e-learning, e-health, e-governement, and
life sciences.
    Enterprise workflows, document flows, business intelligence,
technological watch.
    Corporate knowledge management or personal information management.
   Expert matching, team creation.
   Integration, interoperability and reuse of web collaborative spaces:
* Integration and interoperability with other semantic applications and
mashups.
    Interlinking, distributing, and federating SWCS.
    Extending non-semantic social web platforms with semantics.
    Exporting and reusing semantics gained from SWCS.

-- Submissions and Proceedings --

We invite the following different kinds of contributions:

* Full research or application papers (15 pages) describing recent
research outcomes, mature work, prototypes, applications, or
methodologies; authors of accepted full papers will be able to present
their work in a 25 minute talk at the workshop.

* Short position papers (5-=C2=AD10 pages) describing early work and new
ideas that are not yet fully worked out; authors of short papers will
be able to present their work in a 5=C2=AD10 minute lightning talk at the
workshop.

* Demo outlines (5 pages) describing the demonstration of a software
prototype in the poster and demo session during the workshop

* Poster descriptions (2 pages) outlining a poster to be presented in
the poster and demo session during the workshop.

All submissions must be written in English. We require submissions in
LNCS format. The proceedings will be online and we expect to publish
extended and revised versions of the accepted papers in a LNCS volume
(pending for approval). Please submit your contributions
electronically in PDF format at:
