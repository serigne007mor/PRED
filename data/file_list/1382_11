IDA 2009: The eighth International Symposium on Intelligent Data
Analysis

Lyon-France
August 31th, September 2nd - 2009

http://ida09.liris.cnrs.fr/

---------------
Call for Papers
---------------

Over the past decade, there has been a growing body of literature on the
understanding of data analysis processes. Making smart use of the
increasingly sophisticated analysis algorithms requires much expert
knowledge to be part of the process itself, often in an interactive
way. This knowledge is at least partially integrated into more complex
data analysis meta-methods and modeling scenarios that have proven
beneficial. In addition to more traditional algorithmic or application
oriented submissions, IDA-2009 especially encourages submissions of
papers addressing this emerging trend at the crossroads of traditional
data analysis methods, complex data analysis scenarios and interactive
tools that assist the analyst throughout the process. We are interested
in papers describing methods that aid the analyst in the analysis
procedure and we are also looking for contributions abstracting or
formalizing the - often interactive - data analysis process.
Contributions describing such methods should highlight potential
insights into the data that the presented method offers. Examples of
interesting scenarios describing steps from data to interesting models
are abstractions or formalizations in terms of, for instance, generic
workflows or data analysis "design patterns". Also, description and
support for interactivity in data analysis processes are of particular
interest. Methods can stem from, but are not limited to, the areas of
Machine Learning, Statistics, Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, and
(Interactive) Visualization.

---------------------
Proceedings and venue
---------------------

The proceedings of IDA 2009 will appear in the prestigious Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series by Springer. Notice that Lyon will
host VLDB 2009 (35th International Conference on Very Large Databases)
from August 24 to August 28. Lyon is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage
Site and we invite you to enjoy its splendor and its wonderful way of
life.
