Announcement and Call for Participation
         OWL Experiences and Directions Workshop
    Washington, D.C., metro area, U.S.A., 1-2 April 2008
         http://webont.org/owled/2008dc/index.html

SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE on 15 February!

The fourth OWL: Experiences and Directions workshop
http://www.webont.org/owled/2008dc/ will again bring users, implementors
and researchers together in order to measure the current state of need
against the state of the art and to set an agenda for language
evolutions that satisfy users.  This OWLED workshop will last two days
and will be held in the Washington, D.C., area, in the first week of
April 2008.  The workshop will concentrate on issues related to the
development and W3C standardization of OWL 1.1, but other issues related
to OWL are also of interest, particularly those related to the task
forces set up at OWLED 2007.

As an "interim" workshop, the workshop will be more open and
unconstrained than recent OWLED workshops.  The workshop will have two
very different kinds of activities.  There will be some formal
presentation of some submissions to the workshop.  However, the bulk of
the workshop will be devoted to self-organizing groups discussing topics
related to submissions to the workshop and possibly other topics related
to OWL.

Making this self-organization work will require effort on the part of
the attendees.  Workshop attendees should read submissions accepted at
the workshop before the workshop starts so that they can contribute to
the discussions at the workshop.  Attendees should also prepare single
"slides" that can be presented during these discussions.

Submissions

Potential attendees who need official invitations to the workshop should
submit a short statement of interest (maximum 4 pages).  To allow
attendees to make travel plans, submissions of interest submitted early
will receive early invitations.  There will also be open registration
for the workshop.  Attendees who are not submitting a formal paper are
encouraged to submit a statement of interest.

Longer papers (up to 10 pages, LNCS style) can also be submitted to the
workshop and space will be reserved for authors of papers.  Accepted
papers will be made available to attendees before the workshop.

Systems demonstrations are also welcome.  Interested parties should
submit a short description (maximum 4 pages) of their demonstration.

For more information on submissions see the workshop web page at
http://webont.org/owled/2008dc/index.html
