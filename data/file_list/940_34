*Second Call for Papers
The Second Workshop on Quality issues, measures of interestingness and 
evaluation of data mining models / PAKDD 2011*

QIMIE'11 - May 24, 2011.
Shenzhen, China

QIMIE'11 website:
https://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/qimie2011/

QIMIE'11: Blog to discuss about quality issues and evaluation of data 
mining models:
http://quality-evaluation-data-mining-models.blogspot.com/


QIMIE'11 is organized in association with the next PAKDD'11 conference 
(15th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 
<http://pakdd2011.pakdd.org/>, Shenzhen, China, May 24-27, 2011), a 
major international conference in the areas of data mining and knowledge 
discovery.

*Call for papers*
The Quality issues, measures of interestingness and evaluation of data 
mining models Workshop (QIMIE'11) will focus on the theory, the 
techniques and the practices that can ensure the discovered knowledge is 
of quality.

We invite submissions on all aspects of quality and evaluation of data 
mining models.

The submitted papers must not be published or under consideration to be 
published elsewhere. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members 
of the Program Committee. Each paper should consist of a cover page with 
title, authors’ names, postal and email address, an up to 200-words 
abstract, up to 5 keywords and a body not longer than 12 single-spaced 
pages with font size at
least 11 pts. Authors are strongly encouraged to use Springer’s 
manuscript submission guidelines 
<https://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/qimie2011/call-for-paper/>.

Outstanding papers presented at QMIE'11 could be considered for 
publication in a LNCS/LNAI Post Proceedings of PAKDD Workshops published 
by Springer (see for example PAKDD 2009 Revised Selected Papers 
<http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-14639-8>) or in a 
post-workshop journal special issues. Information about these 
possibilities will be provided as soon as possible.

*Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: *

    * objective measures of interest
    * subjective measures of interest and quality based on human
      knowledge, quality of ontologies, actionable rules
    * algorithmic properties of measures of interest
    * comparison of algorithm: issues with benchmarks, experiments and
      parameters tuning questioning also reproducibility of data mining
      results, the need of new data sets which match new problems,
      methodologies, statistical tests, etc.
    * robustness evaluation and statistical evaluation
    * graphical tools like ROC, cost curves
    * special issues: imbalanced data, very large data set, very high
      dimensional data, changing environments, lack of training data,
      sample selection bias, graph data, etc.
    * special issues in specialized domains: bio-informatics, security,
      information retrieval, sequential and time series data, social
      networks, etc.

As a whole, QIMIE'11 intend to be a forum for a community-wide 
discussion of these issues and to contribute to a deep 
cross-fertilization within a large panel of researchers/practitioners 
attending PAKDD'11. *Thus we strongly encourage interested peoples to 
propose topics and main themes that should be discussed within QIMIE'11*.

For that purpose a blog to discuss about quality issues, measures of 
interestingness and evaluation of data mining models has been launched.

Workshop paper submission deadline 10 January 2011
Workshop author notification 28 January 2011
Workshop camera-ready due 18 February 2011
