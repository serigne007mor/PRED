Subject: [liste-egc] Last CfP: 5th Int'l Workshop on MPM4CPS (Multi-Paradigm
 Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems, co-located with MoDELS'23)

 Dear Colleagues,

Please find below our last CfP for the 5th Edition of the MPM4CPS Workshop,
co-located with MoDELS'23.

Two important points:

   - The page limit is 10 pages, including references (and appendices, if
   any);
   - We have extended the deadline by a week, until 24th of July.

Depending on the final number of accepted papers, we plan to have a
"workshop-style" discussion session during the afternoon (meaning: topics
interesting for participants, to foster new insights and potential
collaborations).

Stay tuned for the next steps.

M.A

*Scope of the Workshop*

Tackling the complexity involved in developing truly complex, designed
systems is a topic of intense research and development. System complexity
has drastically increased once software components were introduced in the
form of embedded systems, controlling physical parts of the system, and has
only grown in CPS, where the networking aspect of the systems and their
environment are also considered. The complexity faced when engineering CPS
is mostly due to the plethora of cross-disciplinary design alternatives and
inter-domain interactions. To date, no unifying theory nor system design
methods, techniques, or tools to design, analyze, and ultimately deploy CPS
exist. Individual (physical systems, software, network) engineering
disciplines offer only partial solutions and are no match for CPS
complexity.

Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) offers a foundational framework for gluing
the several disciplines together in a consistent way. The inherent
complexity of CPS is broken down into most appropriate views and
architectures, at most appropriate levels of abstraction and expressed in
appropriate modeling formalisms, each with precisely defined semantics.
Often complex, collaborative workflows are modelled explicitly too. MPM
aims to provide processes and tools that can combine, couple, and integrate
the many concerns that define a system.

MPM encompasses many research topics: from language engineering (for DSLs,
including their (visual/textual) syntax and semantics), to processes to
support multi-view and multi-abstraction modeling, simulation for
full-system analysis, and deployment. The added complexity that CPS bring
compared to embedded and software-intensive systems requires consideration
of how MPM techniques can be applied or adapted to these new applications,
tying together multiple domains. Many remaining research questions require
answers from researchers in different domains, as well as a unified effort
from researchers that work on supporting techniques and technologies. The
community needs a workshop setting to meet up and align past and future
research activities.

*Topics of Interest (including, but not limited to)*

   - Foundations of domain-specific modelling, with a particular focus on
   classifications of the various dimensions around MPM (formalisms;
   processes; related activities such as V&V, deployment, calibration, etc.=
;
   tools, and methodologies);
   - Modelling language engineering, modular design of modelling languages,
   with a particular focus on de-/composition;
   - Co-simulation, coordination algorithms ensuring correct simulation
   results
   - Model Management with, and for, MPM4CPS: challenges, techniques, tools=
.
   - Applications of MPM techniques in automotive, aviation, manufacturing,
   etc.
   - MPM for (self-)adaptive systems
   - MPM approaches, techniques and tools for related domains: IoT, Digital
   Twins, SmartCPS
   - Social impacts processes in CPS, Large Data Management Modelling in CP=
S

Contributions should clearly address the foundations of Multi-Paradigm
Modeling by demonstrating the use of models to achieve the stated
objectives and discuss the benefits of explicit modeling.

*Submission Procedure*
Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF document via EasyChair
for one of the following topics. Each submission will be peer-reviewed by
at least three PC members.


   - *Full research papers* (10 pages* max) present a novel, innovative
   approach;
   - *Short papers *(5 pages* max) present new ideas or early-stage
   research, extensively discuss the experiences of the researchers with an
   MPM approach or demonstrate a tool;
   - *Examplar descriptions *(10 pages* max) describing a CPS Engineering
   practice, highlighting both the processes at play and the formalisms,
   languages and/or tools used to support these activities, all expressed
   using the language described in the Workshop's webpage.
   - *Extended abstracts* (1 page) for a "lightning talk" (possibly
   accompanied with a Poster), i.e. a short, focused talk that can spark
   lively debate.

(*) including references, and any other material (appendices, etc.)

All papers, except Extended Abstracts, will be published with the main
conference's workshop proceedings; authors submitting examplars will
eventually be invited to contribute to a Special Issue.

*Important Dates*
*Paper submission deadline: *17 July *24 July* 2023
*Notification of acceptance: *15 August 2023
*Workshop dates: *1 - 3 October 2023 (exact date TBA)
