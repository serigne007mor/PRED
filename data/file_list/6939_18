We have a 6 month payed internship available for students following a 
master research programme in computer science (or other computer science 
master students who have a strong interest in research) to work on the 
topic "Data quality techniques for large temporal datasets"


Host institution: IRISA Rennes, DRUID research team.

Supervisors: Zoltan Miklos, Thomas Guyet


Contact: zoltan.miklos@irisa.fr


We are happy to discuss the subect with the interested candidates. To 
candidate for the internship, please send the following documents: CV, 
motivation letter, extrait of academmic results (master), recommendation 
letters (if available).


best regards,
Zoltan Miklos



Description of the subject:

Modern information systems need to cope with large amounts of data that 
is integrated from multiple sources. While recent advances in data 
management infrastructures offer efficient means to search and query 
these datasets, the quality of any application that is using the data 
ultimately depends on the quality of the available data.


The goal of the project is to develop data quality analysis and repair 
techniques, in the context of a medical application. In particular we 
are interested in consistency problems: medical experts can explain 
certain consistency conditions that they expect from the (integrated) 
dataset. We would like to develop simple means to represent these 
conditions. The precise formulation of these constraints would enable a 
systematic way to detect all potential problems. The goal of the project 
is not only to detect the (potential) problems but also to develop 
methods (and a tool) that can support the repair phase: we would like to 
1) provide the user with as much support information about the problem 
(from the data) as possible, 2) minimize the necessary user involvement 
(through automatic techniques, such as reasoning, machine learning, 
etc.). Such techniques were developed in a different context in [1]. As 
potentially not all data is integrated upfront, pay-as-you-go analysis 
and repair techniques can play an important role [2].


In the project you will use a real (anonymized) dataset from the French 
insurance agency, containing the patients medical history records such 
as consultations, medications, hospital stays etc. The internship is 
financed through the PEPS project that uses the above mentioned dataset 
for pharmaco-epidemiologic studies, in which the medical experts would 
like to understand the impact of medications on the patient's health. 
The data quality issues are thus particularly important, as they might 
influence the findings.


The internship project should develop generic data quality and repair 
approaches and  validate them on the available medical dataset.
