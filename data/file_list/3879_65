Call for Papers

EXEC-MAN invites submissions of original research, practical =
experiences, evaluation results, or novel approaches and applications =
related to explainable artificial intelligence to medical and healthcare =
data. Papers submitted should be at most twelve (12) LNCS style pages =
long (including references and figures). In addition, we welcome =
technical summaries of previous research relevant to the workshop as =
short paper submissions of up to eight (8) LNCS style pages long =
(including all references and figures). Papers of this kind outline the =
work of the authors that has already been published in other venues, and =
highlight the relevant future directions. Finally, we strongly encourage =
position and vision papers of up to six (6) LNCS style pages long =
(including all references and figures). Submissions should have their =
type mentioned within, as a title footnote (i.e., technical, summary, or =
position paper). Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or =
formatting requirements will be desk rejected.=20

We kindly ask authors to adopt inclusive language in their papers and =
presentations (https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html and =
https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivetalks.html), and all participants =
to adopt a proper code on conduct =
(https://dbdni.github.io/pages/codeofconduct.html).

Medicine and healthcare management systems are high-stake domains that =
now heavily rely on the recent progress of machine and deep learning, =
coined as =E2=80=9CAI=E2=80=9D (Artificial Intelligence) to support =
complex decision tasks. Complex data acquisition, pre-processing, and =
then analysis pipelines are set up to answer questions related to the =
medical situation of patients or in a prospective way to learn more =
about diseases, healthcare paths, treatments, physiological, chemical or =
biological processes involved in medicine and healthcare. As such, these =
decision systems delegate to end-to-end data-driven systems with no or =
little regulation, decisions that generally have a crucial impact on the =
life of patients.=20

EXEC-MAN aims to bring together an interdisciplinary audience interested =
in the fields of explainable AI as well as healthcare data management =
and analytics to discuss the unique challenges in explaining and =
bringing transparency to automated intelligent decision systems based on =
AI applied to medicine and healthcare data.
=20
As such, scientific challenges of interest relate to new explainable =
=E2=80=9DAI=E2=80=9D methods and/or any data management and analytics =
pipeline in the healthcare domain as well as =E2=80=9Chuman in the =
loop=E2=80=9D for everything related to the interaction of physicians =
with models and or explanations.

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

- legal and ethical aspect of XAI for medicine and healthcare
- terminology in transdisciplinary study in medicine and computer =
sciences
- limit of existing XAI approaches for healthcare data management and =
analytics
- explaining healthcare management: IS, DB, data storage, data =
provenance
- XAI and medical images
- explainable personalized medicine: individualized prevention
- trust in (predictive or explainer) models
- understanding impact of treatments: towards less invasive treatments
- optimizing health trajectory / path, patient trajectory in hospitals
- objective and standardized quality evaluation: clinical validation, =
consistency assessment, and human-centered quality assessment as key =
features to ensure effective explanations for the end users.
- novel post-hoc or intrinsic XAI models for healthcare data analytics
- presentation of case studies or medical open datasets
- user-in-the-loop for explainability
- XAI feedback system for healthcare data analytics
- user-centered XAI
- explanation as a data narration
- explaining data bias
