                      CALL FOR PAPERS
      Special Session on Data Science Approaches for
    Modeling, Analyzing and Mining Networks on Networks

       to be held on October 6-9 (Online Event)
                  co-located with DSAA 2021

Important Dates:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
** Submission Deadline: 23 May 2021
** Notification of Acceptance: 25 July 2021
** Camera-Ready Versions Due: 8 August 2021


Objectives:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Structures built upon great quantities of networked entities, such as
computer networks and social networks, have an undeniable central role in
our everyday life. The need to study these complex real-world topologies,
together with the growing ability to carry out these studies thanks to
technological advances, recently made the use of complex network models
pervasive in many disciplines such as computer science, physics, social
science, as well as in interdisciplinary research environments. A special
focus among others can be made on cyber-physical networks, which refers to
multi-layer networks depicting at least two related sets of interactions of
different types; some occur in the physical world while others take place
in the cyberspace. Social systems, with the ubiquitous use of on-line
social media combined with the ubiquitous use of connected devices (smart
phones, connected objects) are one obvious example of targeted systems.
Modern critical infra-structure systems such as power grids, public
transportation systems, financial networks, the World Wide Web and the
Internet are further additional examples. In all these different systems,
cyber and physical layers evolve at different paces but the evolution of
one layer is tightly influencing the dynamic of and on other layers. We use
the term Networks on Networks to designate the fact that even if each
network (or layer) can be studied separately as frequently done today, our
goal is to study the mutual influence among different layers of the same
cyber-physical network.

The aim of this special session, is to get an insight into the current
status of research in network on networks modeling, analysis and mining,
showing how modeling information in Networks on Networks can make it
possible to focus on domains and research questions that have not been
deeply investigated so far and to improve solutions to classic tasks. We
encourage contributions on methods and techniques that are both
domain-specific but also transversal to different application domains. We
will consider the two main aspects of network analysis: modeling and
knowledge discovery. The session should point out this differentiation, and
enforce the interaction between researchers from different domains. In
particular, we solicit contributions that aim to focus on the analysis of
networks on networks, addressing important principles, methods, tools and
future research directions in this emerging field. The special session will
increase the visibility of the above research themes, and will also bridge
research tasks from different fields of data science. Even though the focus
is on computer science, the themes of the special session also encourage
interdisciplinary discussion about topics touching different fields such as
physics, social science and humanities.

Overall, we are interested in receiving papers related to the following
topics which include but are not limited to:

=E2=80=93 Foundations of Learning and Mining in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Layer Correlation in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Centrality and Ranking in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Community Detection in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Link Prediction in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Simplification/pruning/sampling of Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Embedding and Deep Learning in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Visualization of Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Pattern mining in Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Probabilistic and Uncertain Networks on Networks
=E2=80=93 Domain-driven applications

The special session will in particular target applications in areas related
to:
=E2=80=93 agricultural monitoring
=E2=80=93 cyber-physical systems
=E2=80=93 cyber-security
=E2=80=93 environmental analytics
=E2=80=93 human sensing
=E2=80=93 industrial risk studies
=E2=80=93 landscape analysis


Submissions:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
All submitted papers must be written in English.
The paper length allowed for papers submitted to the special session is a
maximum of ten (10) pages.

The format of papers is the standard 2-column U.S. letter style IEEE
Conference template.  See the IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines:
https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html for further
information and instructions.

All submissions will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on
the basis of technical quality, relevance to the conference=E2=80=99s topic=
s of
interest, originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and
affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic
references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions
failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be
rejected without reviews.

Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have
been issued as technical reports or similar cannot be considered for
DSAA=E2=80=992021. An exception to this rule applies to arXiv papers that w=
ere
published in arXiv at least a month prior to DSAA=E2=80=992021 submission d=
eadline.
Authors can submit these arXiv papers to DSAA provided that the submitted
paper=E2=80=99s title and abstract are different from the one appearing in =
arXiv.
Papers that appear in arXiv from the DSAA=E2=80=992021 submission deadline =
until
the review process has ended, will be rejected without reviews.

Authors are also encouraged to support their papers by providing through a
git-type public repository the code and data to support the reproducibility
of their results.
