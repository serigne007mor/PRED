Call for Papers

The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice 
of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) provides an 
international forum for discussing the latest high-quality research 
results in all areas related to machine learning and knowledge discovery 
in databases, as well as their application in innovative application 
domains.

ECML PKDD will present novel work published either in /Machine 
Learning/ or /Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery/ (the "journal 
track"), or in the conference proceedings.  The journal track of the 
conference has closed.  This is a call for submissions to the 
proceedings track.

Submissions are invited on all aspects of machine learning, knowledge 
discovery and data mining, including real-world applications. 
  Submissions to the proceedings track ideally present innovative ideas 
that are inspiring, provoke discussion, and/or are demonstrated to have 
a large potential.  They should be concise, counting at most 16 pages in 
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science format.

Important criteria for all submissions are their:

      * potential to inspire the research community by introducing new 
and relevant problems, concepts, solution strategies, and ideas
      * contribution to solving a problem widely recognized as both 
challenging and important
      * capability to address a novel area of impact of machine learning 
and data mining
      * scientific rigor, correctness, reproducibility of experiments
      * presentation quality: preciseness and clarity is required

IMPORTANT DATES :

Proceedings track:

      * abstract submission: Thursday, April 18, 2013
      * paper submission: Monday, April 22, 2013
      * notification: Friday, June 14, 2013
