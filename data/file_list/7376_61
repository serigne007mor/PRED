Dear colleagues,

2nd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL&  DATA ENGINEERING (MEDI'2012)
October 3-5, 2012
Poitiers, Futuroscope - France
http://medi2012.ensma.fr

The Second International Conference on Model&  Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 3 to 5 October 2012 in Poitiers, Futuroscope -- France. The main objective of our conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI'2012 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.

*All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.*

**Best Papers will be selected for special issue for Journal on Data Semantic (JoDS) (Springer).**

PAPER SUBMISSION DETAILS

Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices). Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages with the indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the paper is accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra page purchase commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
Duplicate submissions are not allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if it is submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already accepted to be published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate submissions thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions require explicit consent from all listed authors.

LOCATION

Poitiers and its surroundings : Culture and Leisure
Poitiers, a warm and lively city with many narrow alleyways situated around its historic university, one of the oldest in Europe. It is a favorite stopover for Romanesque art lovers who are able to find many different reasons to stroll around and discover the town. In the north, across the Clain Valley, sports fans will be just as delighted with the lake at St-Cyr and the International Welcome Centre which includes a wide variety of sports and leisure activities.

Futuroscope : the European Park of the Moving Images
Just outside Poitiers on a great green plain, futuristic shapes puncture the skyline. It's as if all the far fetched settings from the science fiction movies have been beamed down to earth. These are the pavilions of Futuroscope and what goes on inside them can be breathtaking. You can experience the magic of massive 3D cinema, virtual reality simulator rides and the latest in communication technologies. There are 22 of the world's largest and most exciting visual presentations, ranging from classics like Mount Everest and The Grand Canyon to the very latest in dynamic entertainement
