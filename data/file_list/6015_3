Overview
------------------------
The Eleventh International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main 
objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research 
accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between 
the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an 
international platform for the presentation of research on models and 
data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and 
data and their advanced applications. This international scientific 
event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims 
also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, 
projects and faculty/student exchanges.

------------------------------
Topics of interest
------------------------------
Specific areas of interest to MEDI2023 include but are not limited to:

Modelling and Models Engineering

- Modelling languages and related standards
- Modelling in software and complex system engineering
- Formal methods, analysis, verification & validation
- Model-based testing and performance analyses
- Ontology-based modelling
- Heterogeneous modelling, model integration, interoperability, model 
transformation
- Collaborative modelling and model repositories
- Models as services and models monitoring
- Modelling for reuse, dependability and maintainability
- Models for privacy, security, trust, risk
- Data privacy and Security
- Models for Data Science
- Models for Explainable AI
- New trends in Business Process Modelling and Analysis

Data Engineering
- New models and architectures for data stores
- Heterogeneous data, data Integration, Interoperability
- Data warehouses, OLAP, data mining and Analytics
- Extending Data Warehousing Technology
- Database system Internals, performance analysis, self-tuning 
benchmarking and testing
- Database security, personalization, recommendation
- Web databases, Knowledge Graphs
- Service based data management
- Service oriented applications
- Urbanization of database applications
- Data models for AI techniques and Machine Learning
- Data Quality
- Data Analytics
- Business Process monitoring and optimization based on runtime data

Applications and tools
- Industry transfer, experiences
- Applications of modelling for Data Management
- Applications of modelling for Biomedical data and systems
- Modelling tools and experimentation
- Lessons learned and reports related to models/data engineering
- Applications for green technologies

------------------------------
Submission Guidelines
------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application 
papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Duplicate 
submissions are not allowed. Papers must be submitted as a single PDF 
document, via the Easychair system.

Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS style (Latex style only for 
camera-ready papers) and should not exceed 14 pages. Submitted papers 
will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, 
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.

The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper 
if it reports interesting results but does not justify a publication as 
a full paper.

As for the previous edition of MEDI, all accepted papers including short 
papers will be published in Springer LNCS series. The book metrics 
available on SpringerLink to previous MEDI proceedings, 
https://link.springer.com/conference/medi give details on the number of 
citations, downloads, and readers at paper level and at book level.

One author of an accepted paper must register to MEDI 2023 in order to 
have the paper published. Each accepted paper must be presented at the 
conference by one of the authors.
