PURPOSE / HISTORY:

    DMIN'10 Conference is being held jointly (same location and dates)
    with a number of other research conferences (WORLDCOMP).
    WORLDCOMP is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer
    science, computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate
    to have 2,000 or more attendees from over 85 countries participating
    at WORLDCOMP Congress. A number of individual research tracks of
    the Congress have been held for many years; for example, PDPTA has
    been held annually since 1995 (PDPTA'10 is the 16th annual
    conference); ERSA has been held annually since 2001 (ERSA'10 is the
    10th annual conference); ICAI has been held annually since 1999
    (ICAI'10 is the 12th annual conference); DMIN has been held
    annually since 2003 (DMIN'10 is the 8th annual conference;
    originally it was offered as part of IKE). Other tracks of
    WORLDCOMP Congress have similar records.

    The motivation behind this federated congress is to assemble
    a spectrum of affiliated research conferences into a coordinated
    research meeting held in a common place at a common time. The
    main goal is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas in a
    number of research areas that interact. The model used to form
    DMIN facilitates communication among researchers from all
    over the world in different fields of computer science,
    computer engineering, applied computing, information science,
    and computational biology. Both inward research (core areas)
    and outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary,
    and applications) will be covered during the conference.
    DMIN makes concerted effort to reach out to participants
    affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities,
    institutions, corporations, government agencies, and research
    centers/labs) from all over the world.

    DMIN'10 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
    lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions,
    and poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel
    speakers have included (as part of the federated event):
    Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer/computer architecture, U. of
    California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of
    Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of
    Genetic Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as
    Father of Grid Computing; U. of Chicago&  ANL), Prof. Ruzena
    Bajcsy (pioneer/VR, U. of California, Berkeley), Prof. Barry
    Vercoe (Founding member of MIT Media Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys
    (known as X-man, developer of X Window System, xhost; OLPC),
    Prof. John Koza (known as Father of Genetic Programming,
    Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey (NIH Program Director, U. of
    Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer, U. of Southern
    California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director and
    Consultant), Prof. Jun Liu (Broad Institute of MIT&  Harvard U.),
    Anousheh Ansari (CEO, Prodea Systems&  first female private
    space explorer), and many other distinguished speakers.
    Tutorial speakers for data mining oriented tutorials have included
    Prof. Eamonn Keogh (U. of California,Riverside), Ashu M. G. Solo
    (Principal of Maverick Technologies America Inc.), Mikhail Golovnya
    (Senior Scientist, Salford Systems), Prof. Nitesh V. Chawla
    (U. of Notre Dame, USA), Dr. Peter Geczy (National Institute of
    Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan),
    Prof. Asim Roy (Arizona State University), and Dr. Dan Steinberg
    (CEO of Salford Systems).

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS, PUBLICATION, INDEXING INFORMATION:

    Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by
    uploading them to the DMIN'10 online paper collection and
    review system. Submissions must be uploaded by March 21, 2010
    and they must be in pdf format. Details (submission system,
    typesetting formats etc.) can be found on the DMIN'10 web site at:
    http://www.dmin-2010.com/submission.htm

    The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
    limited to 7 (IEEE style) pages. Papers must not have been
    previously published or currently submitted for publication
    elsewhere. The first page of the draft paper should include:
    title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and
    email address for each author. The first page should also
    identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5
    topical keywords that would best represent the content of
    the paper.

    Full papers will be evaluated for originality, significance,
    clarity, impact, and soundness. Each paper will be refereed
    by at least two experts in the field who are independent of the
    conference program committee. The referees' evaluations will
    then be reviewed by one member of the program committee who
    will recommend a decision to the chair of the track that
    the paper has been submitted to. The chair will make the
    final decision. Lastly, the final papers will be reviewed
    by one member of the program committee.

    All accepted papers will be published in the respective
    conference proceedings (in both, printed book form as well as
    online). The proceedings will be indexed in Inspec/IET/
    The Institute for Engineering and Technology, DBLP/Computer
    Science Bibliography, and others.) The printed proceedings
    will be available for distribution on site at the conference.

    In addition to the publication of the proceedings, selected
    authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their
    papers for publication in a number of research books being
    proposed/contracted with various publishers (such as, Springer,
    Elsevier, IOS, ...) - these books would be composed after the
    conference. Also, many chairs of sessions and workshops will
    be forming journal special issues to be published after the
    conference. For DMIN'10, it is planned to publish extended
    papers in a Special Issue in Annals of Information Systems
    focused on Web Mining.

PURPOSE / HISTORY:

   DMIN'10 Conference is being held jointly (same location and dates)
   with a number of other research conferences (WORLDCOMP).
   WORLDCOMP is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer
   science, computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate
   to have 2,000 or more attendees from over 85 countries participating
   at WORLDCOMP Congress. A number of individual research tracks of
   the Congress have been held for many years; for example, PDPTA has
   been held annually since 1995 (PDPTA'10 is the 16th annual
   conference); ERSA has been held annually since 2001 (ERSA'10 is the
   10th annual conference); ICAI has been held annually since 1999
   (ICAI'10 is the 12th annual conference); DMIN has been held
   annually since 2003 (DMIN'10 is the 8th annual conference;
   originally it was offered as part of IKE). Other tracks of
   WORLDCOMP Congress have similar records.

   The motivation behind this federated congress is to assemble
   a spectrum of affiliated research conferences into a coordinated
   research meeting held in a common place at a common time. The
   main goal is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas in a
   number of research areas that interact. The model used to form
   DMIN facilitates communication among researchers from all
   over the world in different fields of computer science,
   computer engineering, applied computing, information science,
   and computational biology. Both inward research (core areas)
   and outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary,
   and applications) will be covered during the conference.
   DMIN makes concerted effort to reach out to participants
   affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities,
   institutions, corporations, government agencies, and research
   centers/labs) from all over the world.

   DMIN'10 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
   lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions,
   and poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel
   speakers have included (as part of the federated event):
   Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer/computer architecture, U. of
   California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of
   Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of
   Genetic Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as
   Father of Grid Computing; U. of Chicago &amp; ANL), Prof. Ruzena
   Bajcsy (pioneer/VR, U. of California, Berkeley), Prof. Barry
   Vercoe (Founding member of MIT Media Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys
   (known as X-man, developer of X Window System, xhost; OLPC),
   Prof. John Koza (known as Father of Genetic Programming,
   Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey (NIH Program Director, U. of
   Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer, U. of Southern
   California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director and
   Consultant), Prof. Jun Liu (Broad Institute of MIT &amp; Harvard U.),
   Anousheh Ansari (CEO, Prodea Systems &amp; first female private
   space explorer), and many other distinguished speakers. 
   Tutorial speakers for data mining oriented tutorials have included
   Prof. Eamonn Keogh (U. of California,Riverside), Ashu M. G. Solo
   (Principal of Maverick Technologies America Inc.), Mikhail Golovnya 
   (Senior Scientist, Salford Systems), Prof. Nitesh V. Chawla 
   (U. of Notre Dame, USA), Dr. Peter Geczy (National Institute of 
   Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan),
   Prof. Asim Roy (Arizona State University), and Dr. Dan Steinberg 
   (CEO of Salford Systems).

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS, PUBLICATION, INDEXING INFORMATION:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by
   uploading them to the DMIN'10 online paper collection and
   review system. Submissions must be uploaded by March 21, 2010 
   and they must be in pdf format. Details (submission system, 
   typesetting formats etc.) can be found on the DMIN'10 web site at:
   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.dmin-2010.com/submission.htm">http://www.dmin-2010.com/submission.htm</a>

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
   limited to 7 (IEEE style) pages. Papers must not have been
   previously published or currently submitted for publication
   elsewhere. The first page of the draft paper should include:
   title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and
   email address for each author. The first page should also
   identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5
   topical keywords that would best represent the content of
   the paper. 

   Full papers will be evaluated for originality, significance,
   clarity, impact, and soundness. Each paper will be refereed
   by at least two experts in the field who are independent of the
   conference program committee. The referees' evaluations will
   then be reviewed by one member of the program committee who
   will recommend a decision to the chair of the track that
   the paper has been submitted to. The chair will make the
   final decision. Lastly, the final papers will be reviewed
   by one member of the program committee.

   All accepted papers will be published in the respective
   conference proceedings (in both, printed book form as well as
   online). The proceedings will be indexed in Inspec/IET/
   The Institute for Engineering and Technology, DBLP/Computer
   Science Bibliography, and others.) The printed proceedings
   will be available for distribution on site at the conference.

   In addition to the publication of the proceedings, selected
   authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their
   papers for publication in a number of research books being
   proposed/contracted with various publishers (such as, Springer,
   Elsevier, IOS, ...) - these books would be composed after the
   conference. Also, many chairs of sessions and workshops will
   be forming journal special issues to be published after the
   conference. For DMIN'10, it is planned to publish extended 
   papers in a Special Issue in Annals of Information Systems 
   focused on Web Mining.

   This is a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities and
   over 3,000 rooms. It is minutes from the airport with 24-hour
   shuttle service to and from the airport. This hotel has many
   recreational attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools,
   sunning decks, Easy River, wave pool, nightly shows, many
   restaurants, ... The hotel is adjacent to CityCenter
   ( <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityCenter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityCenter</a> ) which is the
   largest private development in the United States' history
   (costing over $11 Billion); this offers access to additional
   recreational and entertainment attractions. The negotiated
   room rate for conference attendees is very reasonable.
