CALL FOR PAPERS

The rapid development in information science and technology in general
and in growth complexity and volume of data in particular has
introduced new challenges for the research community. Many sources
produce data continuously. Examples include sensor networks, wireless
networks, radio frequency identification (RFID), health-care devices
and information systems, customer click streams, telephone records,
multimedia data, scientific data, sets of retail chain transactions,
etc. These sources are called data streams. =A0A data stream is an
ordered sequence of instances that can be read only once or a small
number of times using limited computing and storage capabilities.
These sources of data are characterized by being open-ended, flowing
at high-speed, and generated by non stationary distributions.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
We are looking for original, unpublished work related to algorithms,
methods and applications on data streams. Topics include (but are not
restricted) to:

- Data Stream Models
- Data Stream Management Systems
- Data Stream Query Languages
- Continuous queries and Summarization from Data Streams
- Sampling Data Streams
- Single-Pass Algorithms
- Scalable Algorithms
- Change Detection Algorithms
- Clustering on Data Streams
- Classification and Regression on Data Streams
- Association Rules on Data Streams
- Feature Selection on Data Streams
- Visualization Techniques for Data Streams
- Evaluation of Data Streams Models
- Data Stream applications
- Sensor Networks
- Real-Time Applications

IMPORTANT DATES (strict)
- Paper Submission: 31 August, 2011
- Author Notification: 12 October, 2011
- Camera-ready Copy: 2 November, 2011

PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Papers should be submitted in PDF using the SAC 2012 conference
management system: http://www.softconf.com/c/sac2012/. Authors are
invited to submit original papers in all topics related to data
streams. All papers should be submitted in ACM 2-column camera ready
format for publication in the symposium proceedings. ACM SAC follows a
double blind review process. Consequently, the author(s) name(s) and
address(s) must NOT appear in the body of the submitted paper, and
self-references should be in the third person. This is to facilitate
double blind review required by ACM. All submitted papers must include
the paper identification number provided by the eCMS system when the
paper is first registered. The number must appear on the front page,
above the title of the paper. Each submitted paper will be fully
refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three
referees. The conference proceedings will be published by ACM. The
maximum number of pages allowed for the final papers is 6 pages. There
is a set of templates to support the required paper format for a
number of document preparation systems at:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html
