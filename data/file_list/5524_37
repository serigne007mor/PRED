Subject: [liste-egc] Reminder: CfP for Machine Learning and Data Mining for
 Sports Analytics 2022 (MLSA22) co-located with ECML/PKDD 2022

**One week left before the deadline!**

*Scope of the workshop*

Sports Analytics has been a steadily growing and rapidly evolving area ove=
r the last decade both in US professional sports leagues and in European fo=
otball leagues=2E The recent implementation of strict financial fair-play r=
egulations in European football will definitely increase the importance of =
Sports Analytics in the coming years=2E In addition, there is of course the=
 popularity of sports betting=2E The developed approaches are being used fo=
r decision support in all aspects of professional sports, including:

- Analyzing positional data (tracking data)
- Match strategy, tactics, and analysis
- Player acquisition, player valuation, and team spending
- Training regimens and focus
- Injury prediction and prevention
- Performance management and prediction
- Match outcome and league table prediction
- Tournament design and scheduling
- Betting odds calculation

Traditionally, the definition of sports has also included certain non-phys=
ical activities, such as chess =E2=80=93 in other words, games=2E Especiall=
y in the last decade, so-called e-sports, based on a number of computer gam=
es, have become very relevant commercially=2E Professional teams have been =
formed for games such as Starcraft 2, Defense of the Ancients (DOTA) 2, and=
 League of Legends=2E Moreover, tournaments offer large sums of prize money=
 and are important broadcast events=2E Given that topics such as strategy a=
nalysis and match forecasting apply in equal measure to these new sports (a=
nd other topics might apply as well but are not very well explored so far),=
 and data collection is in fact somewhat easier than for off-line sports, w=
e have chosen to broaden the scope of the workshop and solicit e-sports sub=
missions as well=2E

The majority of techniques used in the field so far are statistical=2E How=
ever, there has been on-going and growing interest in the Machine Learning =
and Data Mining community about this topic=2E Building off our successful w=
orkshops on Sports Analytics at ECML/PKDD 2013, ECML/PKDD 2015 through ECML=
/PKDD 2021, we wish to continue to grow this interest by hosting a ninth ed=
ition at ECML/PKDD 2022=2E We are convinced that the setting is interesting=
 and challenging, and can
potentially be a source of new data=2E Furthermore, we believe that this o=
ffers a great opportunity to bring people from outside of the Machine Learn=
ing community into contact with typical ECML/PKDD contributors as well as t=
o highlight what the community has done and can do in the field of Sports A=
nalytics=2E

*Submissions*

The workshop solicits papers covering both predictive and descriptive Mach=
ine Learning, Data Mining, and related approaches to Sports Analytics setti=
ngs, including, but not limited to, the list of topics above=2E Adopting a =
broad definition of sports, the workshop is also open to submissions on ele=
ctronic sports (i=2Ee=2E, e-sports) that are related to any of these topics=
=2E The following types of papers can be submitted:

- Long papers will be 9 pages of content and an unlimited number of refere=
nces in the Springer LNCS style and should report on novel, unpublished wor=
k that might not be quite mature enough for a conference or journal submiss=
ion=2E
- Extended abstracts will be 2 pages in Springer LNCS style and summarize =
recent publications fitting the workshops=2E

Papers are to be submitted in pdf format at https://easychair=2Eorg/confer=
ences/?conf=3Dmlsa22

Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committ=
ee on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity=
=2E Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper is accepted =
at least one author should present the paper at the workshop=2E The worksho=
p will include invited talks, a mix of oral and poster presentations for al=
l accepted papers, and a discussion regarding the goals, limits, and desira=
bility of Sports Analytics=2E

*Key dates*

Paper submission: 20/06/2022
Author notification: 13/07/2022
Camera-ready due: 27/07/2022
