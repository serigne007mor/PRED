Sousse, 3000 years old, is a city with a rich cultural heritage as well=
 as an important touristic resort. A hot semi-arid climate moderated by=
 a seaside location makes it an all-season resort with a vibrant nightl=
ife.
A medina, surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of histor=
ical interest and includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Classified=
 monuments include the Ribat fortress, the Great Mosque, and a historic=
al museum in the Kasbah citadel with mosaics from the area's many ancie=
nt Roman villas. UNESCO declared the medina of Sousse a World Heritage =
Site in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern =
development.
