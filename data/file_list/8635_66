ECML/PKDD 2014: European Conference on Machine Learning and=20
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases=20

Nancy, France, September 15-19, 2014

http://www.ecmlpkdd2014.org/
-----------------------------------------------------------

The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of =
Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML/PKDD, provides an international foru=
m for the discussion of the latest high-quality research results in all are=
as related to machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery in data=
bases, as well as other innovative application domains. The 2014 edition of=
 ECML/PKDD will take place in Nancy, France, September 15-19.=20

Submissions are invited on all aspects of machine learning, knowledge disco=
very and data mining, including real-world applications. Papers will mainly=
 be evaluated on the basis of their relevance for the conference, their sci=
entific contribution, rigor and correctness, the quality of presentation an=
d reproducibility of experiments. Apart from that, we specifically welcome =
submissions which=20

-- have the potential to inspire the research community by introducing new =
and relevant problems, concepts, solution strategies, and ideas;
-- contribute to solving a problem widely recognized as both challenging an=
d important;
-- address a novel area of impact of machine learning and data mining.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Proceedings=20
-----------------------------------------------------------
The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Not=
es in Artificial Intelligence series (LNAI).=20


-----------------------------------------------------------
Submissions
-----------------------------------------------------------
The papers must be written in English and formatted according to the Spring=
er LNAI guidelines. Authors instructions and style files can be downloaded =
at:http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

The maximum length of papers is 16 pages in this format. Over length papers=
 will be rejected without review (papers with smaller page margins and font=
 sizes than specified in the author instructions and set in the style files=
 will also be treated as over length). Papers submitted should report origi=
nal work; ECML/PKDD 2014 will not accept any paper which, at the time of su=
bmission, is under review or has already been accepted for publication in a=
 journal or another conference. Authors are also expected not to submit the=
ir papers elsewhere during the review period.=20

Guidelines for submission will be made available on the conference website =
soon.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Reviewing process
-----------------------------------------------------------
Papers submitted to ECML/PKDD 2014 will normally be reviewed by three refer=
ees. The review process is single-blind (reviewer identities unknown to aut=
hors) and there will be no opportunity for author rebuttal. This decision w=
as made to minimize reviewer workload and to concentrate it in time, which =
may ultimately result in better quality reviews and decisions. If necessary=
, a discussion will take place among the reviewers of a paper until a decis=
ion is reached.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Important dates
-----------------------------------------------------------
Abstract submission deadline: 12 April 2014
Paper submission deadline: 16 April 2014
Author notification: 15 June 2014
Camera ready submission: 23 June 2014
