The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or =
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in =
the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn =
Shafer as a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty. These =
early contributions have been the starting points of many important =
developments, including the transferable belief model and the theory of =
hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a =
general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well =
understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, =
possibility and imprecise probability theories. It has been applied in =
diverse areas such as machine learning, information fusion and risk =
analysis.

The BELIEF conferences (sponsored by the Belief Functions and =
Applications Society https://www.bfasociety.org/) are dedicated to the =
confrontation of ideas, the reporting of recent achievements and the =
presentation of the wide range of applications of this theory. The first =
edition of this conference series was held in Brest, France, in 2010. =
Later editions were held in Compi=C3=A8gne, France in 2012, Oxford, UK =
in 2014, Prague, Czech Republic in 2016, and again in Compi=C3=A8gne, =
France in 2018. The Sixth International Conference on Belief Functions =
(BELIEF 2021) will be located in Shanghai, China, on October 15-19, =
2021, together with the 2021 International Conference on Cognitive =
analytics, Granular computing, and Three-way decisions (CCGT). It will =
be held both onsite and online due to the COVID-19 situation (see Venue =
and Registration below for details).

The proceedings of the BELIEF 2021 conference will be published by =
Springer-Verlag in a volume of the Lecture Notes in Artificial =
Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI) series and indexed by: ISI Web of Science; EI =
Engineering Index; ACM Digital Library; dblp; Google Scholar; IO-Port; =
MathSciNet; Scopus; Zentralblatt MATH. Previous BELIEF proceedings can =
be found on SpringerLink.

Authors should consult Springer=E2=80=99s authors=E2=80=99 guidelines =
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for =
the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include =
their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of =
each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must =
complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author =
signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked =
on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes =
relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
