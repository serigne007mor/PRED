CALL FOR PAPERS

4th ACM SIGSPTATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Humanities
Co-located with ACM SIGSPATIAL 2020, Seattle, Washington, USA
November 3, 2020

Website: https://ludovicmoncla.github.io/sigspatial-geohumanities-2020/

The 4th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Humanities =
is concerned with the use of geographic information systems and other =
spatial technologies in humanities research. We aim to bring together =
researchers and practitioners from different sub-fields of computer =
science and the geographical information sciences, interested in the =
application of spatial methods and technology to the humanities. =
Participants will explore and demonstrate the contributions to knowledge =
that modern GIS technologies can enable within and beyond the digital =
humanities.

The workshop invites contributions on the following topics, as well as =
other research related to the Spatial Humanities:

- Gazetteer development (e.g., models, data conflation, semantic =
technologies, etc.)
- Ontologies and linked data for modeling geohistorical data
- Historical and literary geographical information systems
- Spatio-temporal network analysis in the humanities
- Text geo-parsing and other NLP techniques for geographical text =
analysis
- Novel approaches for the analysis of vague and imaginary place
- Spatial simulation in the humanities (e.g., cellular automata and =
agent-based models)
- Spatial and spatio-temporal analysis of humanities data
- Visualization and cartographic representations
- Handling vague and imprecise historical spatio-temporal data
- Geoprocessing of digital archives and cultural heritage image =
collection
- Applications of the aforementioned techniques

Contributions should be submitted in the form of long papers (i.e., up =
to 10 pages in PDF), reporting on relatively mature research results, or =
alternatively in the form of short papers (i.e., up to 4 pages in PDF), =
reporting on more speculative and early stage research that may =
nonetheless stimulate discussion at the workshop. Papers should be =
prepared according to the ACM formatting guidelines.

Paper submissions should be made through the EasyChair system:=20
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsigspatial-geohumanities-2020

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the programme =
committee and accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital =
Library.

Paper submissions: 4th September, 2020
Decisions to authors: 25th September, 2020
Camera ready versions: 5th October, 2020
