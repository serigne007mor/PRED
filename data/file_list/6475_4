Formal Concept Analysis For Ontology Engineering

The Orpailleur team offers a 1-year post-doctoral position in Nancy, France=
, starting in Autumn 2014. This project aims at improving existing tools an=
d developing new tools based on Formal Concept Analysis for building ontolo=
gies from structured textual data. Several tracks could be explored. One of=
 them consists in studying the reduction of a concept lattices, i.e. check =
whether the high number of concepts in a concept lattice can be only repres=
ented by attribute concepts and object concepts (also known as the AOC-pose=
t, which can provide a good conceptualization of the domain). Another track=
 aims at using extensions of Formal Concept Analysis, namely Relational Con=
cept Analysis and Pattern Structures, to model more complex phenomena in kn=
owledge representation (such as relational aspects). Moreover, providing do=
main experts with interaction facilities at the lattice level, introducing =
metrics in the lattice (stability=85) are also other possible directions of=
 investigation. The work will involve both theoretical and programming aspe=
cts leading to the development of a running prototype.

Candidates applying for this position should have a PhD in Computer Science=
s with a good background in Knowledge Discovery (Formal Concept Analysis) a=
nd Knowledge Representation. In addition, abilities and experience in progr=
amming in C, C++ or Java are wished.=20

This work comes within the scope of the "Hybride ANR Project" which aims at=
 extracting from PubMed texts some knowledge about rares diseases. The cand=
idate will have to work jointly with another post-doc researcher on Natural=
 Language Processing that will be in charge of producing structured data fr=
om texts.=20

LORIA lab is located in Nancy, East of France. It is among the largest comp=
uter science research laboratories in France involving several research org=
anizations such as CNRS, INRIA Nancy Grand Est and Lorraine University. It =
is a very large and challenging research environment with 29 research teams=
 and excellent computing facilities.
Working languages are French or English.
