6th International Conference on Belief Functions (BELIEF 2020)

October 23-25, Shanghai, China

Conference website: https://bfasociety.org/Belief2020/ =
<https://bfasociety.org/Belief2020/>

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or =
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in =
the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn =
Shafer as a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty. These =
early contributions have been the starting points of many important =
developments, including the Transferable Belief Model and the Theory of =
Hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a =
general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well =
understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, =
possibility and imprecise probability theories.=20

The biennial BELIEF conferences (sponsored by the Belief Functions and =
Applications Society https://www.bfasociety.org/ =
<https://www.bfasociety.org/>) are dedicated to the confrontation of =
ideas, the reporting of recent achievements and the presentation of the =
wide range of applications of this theory. The first edition of this =
conference series was held in Brest, France, in 2010, the second edition =
in Compi=C3=A8gne, France, in 2012, the third edition in Oxford, UK, in =
2014, the fourth edition in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2016, and the =
fifth edition in Compi=C3=A8gne, France, in 2018. The Sixth =
International Conference on Belief Functions (BELIEF 2020) will be held =
in Shanghai, China, on October 23-25, 2020. It will be co-located with =
the 2020 International Conference on Cognitive analytics, Granular =
computing, and Three-way decisions (CCGT). The co-location of the two =
events is intended to favour cross-fertilization among researchers =
active in both communities.

Tentative timetable

- April 15: Paper submission deadline
- May 31: Author notification
- June 30: Camera-ready copy due
