Subject: [liste-egc] Call for tutorials WI-IAT Summer School 2011

The 2011 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conferences on WEB INTELLIGENCE 
and INTELLIGENT AGENT TECHNOLOGY
22 - 27 August 2011
Campus Scientifique de la Doua, Lyon, France
--------------------

WI-IAT Summer School 26-27 August 2011

Call For Tutorials
------------------

The summer school of the 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint 
Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2011) and Intelligent Agent 
Technology (IAT 2011) will take place on August 26-27 2011 in Lyon (France).
This summer school aims providing tutorials both on Web Intelligence (in 
the context of WI 2011) and Intelligent Agent Technology (in the context 
of IAT 2011). It intends to bring together PhD students, lecturers, as 
well as researchers and practitioners who are interested in the 
fundamental roles, interactions as well as practical impacts of 
Artificial Intelligence engineering and Advanced Information Technology 
on the next generation of Web systems. In these tutorials AI-engineering 
is a general term that refers to a new area, slightly beyond traditional 
AI: brain informatics, human level AI, intelligent agents, social 
network intelligence and classical areas, such as knowledge engineering, 
knowledge representation, planning, knowledge discovery and data mining 
are examples. Advanced Information Technology includes wireless 
networks, ubiquitous devices, social networks, data/knowledge grids, as 
well as service oriented architecture, cloud computing. The main goal of 
the summer school is therefore to give an in-depth background on 
subjects that are of broad interest to Web Intelligence and Intelligent 
Agent Technology communities and provide participants the opportunity to 
be up to date with current research trends in these areas.

For a more detailed list of potential topics see 
http://wi-iat-2011.org/IAT_2011/call-for-paper/ and 
http://wi-iat-2011.org/WI_2011/call-for-paper/.

of interest (WI or IAT communities or both)
4. Description of prerequisite knowledge: what background the attendees

books, etc.)

The background information on the presenter(s) should be limited to 2 
pages and must contain:
1. Names, affiliations, homepages and contact details of all the presenters
