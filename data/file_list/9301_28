CALL FOR PAPERS
*************************************************


                       The 11th International Conference on
  Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI'15)
                            http://aiai2015.sigappfr.org/
                                   September 14-17, 2015
                                 Bayonne/Biarritz - France


Description and Objectives
---------------------------

The importance of Artificial Intelligence is underlined by the fact that it=
 is nowadays being embraced by a vast majority of research fields across di=
fferent disciplines, from Engineering Sciences to Economics and Medicine, a=
s a means to tackle highly complicated and challenging computational as wel=
l as cognitive problems. Being one of the main streams of information proce=
ssing, Artificial Intelligence may now offer solutions to such problems usi=
ng advances and innovations from a wide range of sub-areas that induce thin=
king and reasoning in models and systems.

The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations Conference (AIAI) =
is a major technical event in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Sof=
t Computing. The 11th AIAI Conference will be held in Biarritz-Anglet-Bayon=
ne (BAB) in France, from September 14th to 17th 2015. Its general focus is =
to present different perspectives on how Artificial Intelligence may be app=
lied and offer solutions to real world problems, serving the study, analysi=
s and modelling of theoretical and practical issues.

The primary target of AIAI is to present highly novel research papers descr=
ibing innovative algorithms, systems, tools and techniques, as well as prop=
osing advanced prototypes in the area of Artificial Intelligence. General s=
urvey papers indicating future directions and professional work-in-progress=
 reports are of equal interest. Acceptance will be based on quality, origin=
ality and practical merit of the work.

AIAI is supported and sponsored by the International Federation for Informa=
tion Processing (IFIP).
