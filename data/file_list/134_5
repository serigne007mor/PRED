Bonjour,
Pouvez-vous diffuser cette annonce.
Merci d'avance.

Postdoc Fellowship in Ontology Engineering/Data Mining


Applications are invited for the position of postdoctoral assistant in the
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (http://cui.unige.ch/AI-group), CSD,
University of Geneva. The successful candidate will participate in a
European FP7 research project where s/he will ensure ontology engineering
best practice in the development of a data mining ontology (DMO). The
DMO is a comprehensive ontology on all data mining-related issues such
as data preprocessing, machine learning, and multimedia mining. It is
intended to support data mining workflow construction, algorithm and
model selection for all phases of the knowledge discovery process, and
ontology-based knowledge discovery. Research on these issues should support
development of software modules to be integrated into a virtual data
mining laboratory. Further information on the project can be found on
http://www.e-lico.eu. Gross starting salary will be around 5200 CHF/month 
(1 CHF = 0.67 EUR), depending on qualifications.

Candidates should have a PhD in Computer Science with specialization in
ontology engineering as evidenced by relevant publications, plus knowledge 
of machine learning/data mining. Alternatively, they could be ML/DM specialists 
with solid experience in ontology engineering. They should have excellent 
programming skills as well as communication skills in English; French would be 
an asset but is not indispensable. A strong academic record, excellent analytical 
skills and a clear aptitude for autonomous, creative research will be priority 
selection criteria. 

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, academic transcripts, a 
brief statement of purpose, a list of publications, and names and e-mail 
addresses of at least 2 references.

Please e-mail your applications to Melanie.Hilario[at]unige.ch.
The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.
