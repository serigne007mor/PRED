Subject: [liste-egc] CFP-Knowledge Management Research & Practice-Special
 Issue on Knowledge Management and Collaboration


Knowledge Management Research & Practice: Special Issue on Knowledge=20=20
Management and Collaboration


This Special Issue stems from a workshop on =93Knowledge Management and=20=
=20
Collaboration=94 that took place on 24th May 2011, as part of the 2011=20=20
International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems=20=20
(CTS 2011), IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Collaboration=20=20
Technologies and Systems, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA=20=20
http://cts2011.cisedu.info/.


SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Knowledge Management (KM) has been engaging an increasing attention=20=20
within organizations at least since the beginning of the nineties. The=20=20
necessity to manage both explicit and tacit knowledge created and used=20=20
in organizations has increased rapidly in recent years.  Organizations=20=20
have become aware of the importance of the invaluable capital owned by=20=20
their members which corresponds to their experiences and accumulated=20=20
knowledge about the firm's activities.  Maintaining this capital is a=20=20
powerful means to improve the level of economic performance of an=20=20
organization.  Thus, companies should invest in knowledge management=20=20
projects in order to amplify the creation, the sharing and the=20=20
transfer of explicit and tacit knowledge.  Several techniques can be=20=20
considered to develop and implement knowledge management and=20=20
organizational memory systems, according to the type of organization,=20=20
its needs, and its culture as well as the nature of knowledge to be=20=20
capitalized.  For example, knowledge-based approaches, corporate=20=20
semantic web, case-based reasoning (CBR)-based approaches, ontology=20=20
based approaches, agent-based approaches, etc.

The objective of this Special Issue is to gather contributions from=20=20
both researchers and practitioners to discuss methodological,=20=20
technical and organizational aspects of knowledge management, feedback=20=20
of KM applications, especially using collaboration techniques for KM=20=20
and employing KM to increase effective collaboration.  Researchers and=20=20
practitioners are invited to propose recent advances in methodologies,=20=20
models and tools for managing knowledge in organizations and to=20=20
discuss experiences of successful or unsuccessful knowledge management=20=20
projects enhancing collaboration.  Papers are welcomed in any research=20=20
area concerning knowledge management and discovery such as knowledge=20=20
engineering, artificial intelligence, information systems, and the=20=20
knowledge economy.  Target applications of this research and real=20=20
world practice case studies include the following: automobile,=20=20
biology, design, education, medicine, telecommunications, aeronautics=20=20
and space, tourism, finance, public administration, social, etc.
