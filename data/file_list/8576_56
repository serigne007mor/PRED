                 CALL FOR PAPERS

     Workshop on Interactions between Data Mining
        and Natural Language Processing
                  (DMNLP'2014)

             ECML/PKDD 2014 Workshop
      September 15-19, 2014, Nancy, France
             http://dmnlp.loria.fr

********************************************************

------
SCOPE
------

On the one hand, in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
numerical Machine Learning methods (e.g., SVM, CRF) have been
intensively explored and applied. Despite the good results obtained by
the numerical methods, one major drawback is that they do not provide a
human readable model. A promising direction is the integration of
symbolic knowledge.

On the other hand, research in Data Mining has progressed significantly
in the last decades, through the development of advanced algorithms and
techniques to extract knowledge from data in different forms. In
particular, for two decades Pattern Mining has been one of the most
active field in Knowledge Discovery.

Recently, a new field has emerged taking benefit of both domains: Data
Mining and NLP. The objective of DMNLP is thus to provide a forum to
discuss how Data Mining can be interesting for NLP tasks, providing
symbolic knowledge, but also how NLP can enhance data mining approaches
by providing richer and/or more complex information to mine and by
integrating linguistics knowledge directly in the mining process.

The workshop aims at bringing together researchers from both communities
in order to stimulate discussions about the cross-fertilization of those
two research fields. The idea of this workshop is to discuss future
directions and new challenges emerging from the cross-fertilization of
Data Mining and NLP and in the same time initiate collaborations between
researchers of both communities.

---------------
CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------

The workshop promotes works where the two following dimensions are
combined in one as symbiosis. The first dimension is Data Mining, for
instance Pattern Mining (itemsets, sequences, trees, graphs, association
rules), classification (decision trees, FCA,...), inductive logic
programming. The second dimension is NLP, for example question/answering
systems, translation, information extraction, linguistic analysis
(lexical analysis, terminology, syntax, semantics, discourse,
stylistics), classification, knowledge extraction/ontology building from
texts, information retrieval, corpus annotation, social/opinion mining.

A list of non-exhaustive topics that fit the scope of the workshop is thus:

- Pattern discovery for NLP
- Constraint-based pattern mining in text
- Data mining query languages for expressing NLP tasks
- Data representation (sequence, tree, graphs) for NLP
- Modelization of text for data mining
- Relationships between data mining and NLP
- Modeling and visualizing data mining results on text
- Integrating NLP characteristics in data mining
- Data mining approaches for linguistic knowledge building
- Knowledge discovery for linguistic analysis (e.g. stylistic,
socio-linguistics,=85)
- Linguistically-informed text representations for Data Mining


------------------
SUBMISSION FORMAT
------------------

Our main goal is to stimulate discussions, collaborations and the
sharing of experiences.
In that respect, we would have three submission types:

* unpublished works (max 16 pages, double submissions allowed)
* short papers and vision statements (max 8 pages)
* recently published works (special oral-only track, no page limits)

For more details on submission, see the DMNLP webpage at
http://dmnlp.loria.fr


-----------------
IMPORTANT DATES
-----------------

* Deadline for submissions: Friday, June 20, 2014
* Author notification: Friday, July 11, 2014
* Final version: Tuesday July 22, 2014
* Workshop date: Monday September 15 or 19, 2014
