* Systems and alarm diffusion: confidentiality vs. monitoring, (mis-)information vs. rumour, state of the affairs? *


WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
The aim of this workshop is to gather researchers and practitioners working in the area of Information Systems, DataBase, Document management, metadata, workflow management,
conceptual modeling, design, software, etc., to exchange and to share information, to network, to give points of view and to collaborate in project proposals.

This workshop will discuss questions about liveness, dynamicity, reactivity of alarm systems: how to ensure the warning information reach the right destination at the right moment
  and in the right location, still being relevant for the recipient, in spite of the various and successive filters of confidentiality, privacy, firewall policies, etc. ?
Also relevant in this context are to technical contingency issues: material failure, defect of connection, break of channels, independence of information routes and sources?
Alarms with crowd media, (mis-)information vs. rumours: how to make the distinction?

Today, in a more global world, companies, organizations and national agencies are involved in observation systems designed to generate alarms. Considering for instance natural disaster prevention systems, we have a collection of agents, each capable of observing various events and acquiring information which must be aggregated and processed in order to generate alerts. Space Situation Awareness systems, designed to generate warnings to prevent collisions between orbiting objects, or Disease Surveillance systems, which monitor the spreading of diseases at a global scale, are built on similar principles.

Besides these national or international systems, social networks play a role in alerts diffusion. Recently, the micro-blogging platform Twitter announced a new alert diffusion service, purposely designed to help government organisation and non-profit organisations to diffuse alerts to the population. The question of how to specify/manage such mass-reaching system and protect them against misuse deserves some attention from the IS community.

So, one can say that such systems must trigger events as well as be triggered by external events, and must be robust w.r.t. technical contingency:
material failure, defect of connection, break of channels,... or any unforeseen circumstances that they have to cope with, in a dynamic way and in an unknown context.
Fundamental properties of alarm systems are linked to liveness, dynamicity, reactivity, etc.: They must ensure that warning information eventually reaches the right destination at the right moment and in the right location, while being still understandable and relevant for the recipient, in spite of the various confidentiality, anonymisation, firewall, privacy, etc. filtering operations information undergoes. In addition, questions surround the use of personal data in alarm systems: Should alarm systems be allowed access/collect personal user data (with or without the user's consent)? Must the personal data stores be fully controlled by the user?



IMPORTANT DATES
Submission Deadline: April 5th 2015
Acceptance Notification: May 22th 2015
Camera-Ready Submission: June 15th 2015


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Submissions should present original results and substantial new work not currently under review or published elsewhere. This workshop accepts:
- Research papers (up to 14 pages) including novel approaches to deal with these issues.
- Application papers (up to 10 pages) describing applications.
- Industrial papers (up to 4 pages) describing experiences in the industry sectors.
- Demo proposals (up to 2 pages) describing the demo flow.

The workshop proceedings will be published by Springer in the Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing series.
Papers should be submitted in PDF format.
Submissions must conform to Springer's format and should not exceed 14 pages, including all text, figures, references and appendices. The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify publication of a full paper.
Information about the Springer LNCS format can be found at http://www.springer.com/series/11156.

Submission is done through CyberChair at the following page:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wisard15



PUBLICATION
Workshop papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the AISC series (Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing).
The authors of the best workshop papers will be invited to prepare extended versions of their papers after the workshop. Following an additional round of reviews, the extended papers will appear in a special issue of Information System Frontiers, Springer (Impact Factor = 0.761).
