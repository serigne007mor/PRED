Description and Objectives
---------------------------

The International ACM Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems
(EDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia,
research laboratories and industry interested
in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to the resource
management of Digital Ecosystems.
The conference seeks to address how current approaches and technologies can be
evolved and adapted to this end and
will include an informative and interactive session for the presentation of
demonstrations and industrial papers describing
original industrial applications, experiences and challenges.

Proposals should be focused on the conference topics and related techniques.

-------

We solicit demonstrations and industrial proposals related but not limited to
the following topics:

- Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
- Web Technologies
- Social Networks
- Data & Knowledge Management Systems
- Multimedia Information Retrieval
- Ontology Management
- Services systems and Engineering
- E-Services, E-Learning, E-Humanities and E-Government
- Emergent Intelligence

Demonstrations and Industrial Proposal Submissions
--------------------------------------------------

Submissions must follow ACM format guidelines and must be uploaded in PDF format
using the conference website.
Proposals must be no more than four pages long. This page limit includes all
parts of the paper: title, abstract, body, and bibliography.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 peer reviewers.
Selection criteria will include relevance, significance, impact, technical
soundness, and quality of presentation.
At least one author should attend the conference to present the proposal.
Accepted proposals will appear in the final proceedings of the main conference
published by ACM and indexed by the ACM Digital Library.

Demonstration proposals must clearly describe what will be demonstrated, how the
contribution will be illustrated interactively
and how the audience will interact in order to understand the concepts being
demonstrated.

Optionally, proposals can include a URL that shows a preliminary version of the
demonstration such as screenshots
or another interactive program.
