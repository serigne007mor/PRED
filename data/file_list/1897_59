*Deadline: 20th of November, 2020 *
======

In recent years, various efforts have arisen with regard to the 
representation and publication of linguistic resources such as lexicons, 
dictionaries, corpora, terminologies and linguistic ontologies. These 
efforts have exploited Semantic Web technologies and the Linguistic 
Linked Data (LLD) publication paradigm to facilitate and enhance the 
discovery, interoperability, integration and reusability of language 
resources. Initiatives such as the H2020 projects ELEXIS and Prêt-à-LLOD 
and the COST Action NexusLinguarum aim at developing robust ecosystems 
and networks of experts to address the LLD lifecycle, from identifying 
the requirements concerning the representation of linguistic resources 
to their exploitation by natural language processing (NLP) applications. 
With the rapid growth of the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud 
and the increasing interest in the use of linked data for NLP, new 
challenges emerge concerning particular use cases and domain 
applications, language-specific features and quality dimensions, the 
evolution of LLD resources throughout time and the leverage of 
linguistic resources along LD technologies in NLP research, among other 
diverse aspects.

This special issue on the latest advancements in LLD invites 
high-quality contributions, supported by a robust evaluation, which 
present an advancement in the state-of-the-art in the field of LLD 
methodologies and technologies and their use for NLP and provide 
insights into the new challenges ahead. The list of topics includes, but 
is not limited to, the following:

  * Knowledge Representation for Linguistic Data
      o Ontologies, vocabularies and linguistic category registries for
        linguistic data
      o Representation languages for linguistic data as LLD
      o Modelling challenges with state-of-the-art LLD models (e.g.
        OntoLex-Lemon)
      o Use case-based representation requirements for LLD
      o Ontology engineering for linguistic data representation:
        building, evaluation, evolution, alignment and reuse of
        ontologies for computational linguistics and NLP
  * LLD Generation and Evolution
      o Methodologies and workflows for LLD generation
      o Diachronic and sociolinguistic approaches to LLD generation and
        evolution
      o Innovative approaches to automatic LLD generation
      o Technically robust and systematically evaluated LLD resources
      o LLD for under-resourced and underrepresented languages and domains
      o Linking LLD sets across multiple dimensions and levels of
        linguistic description
      o LLD quality evaluation and resource curation
      o LLD extension, enrichment and evolution
  * LLD Publication, Querying and Visualization
      o Publication and metadata
      o IPR, licensing and privacy issues
      o LLD specific query techniques and languages
      o Supporting interfaces for different steps of the LLD lifecycle
      o Visualization of LLD
  * LLD and NLP research
      o LLD for NLP and NLP for LLD
      o Integration, exploitation and added value of LLD technologies
        and interoperable linguistic resources in NLP systems
      o LLD in Deep Learning-based NLP approaches
      o LLD in Big Data contexts
  * Applications and Use Cases
      o Automatic approaches for different steps of the LLD lifecycle
      o Knowledge extraction and representation from linguistic resources
      o LLD for research in specific domains (e.g. linguistics, digital
        humanities, life sciences, law, journalism, etc.)
      o LLD specific features and requirements from domain experts


    Deadline

Submission deadline: 20th of November, 2020. Papers submitted before the 
deadline will be reviewed upon receipt.
