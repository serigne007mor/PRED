The 7th IEEE International Workshop on Formal Methods Integration

Introduction and Scope:
----------------------
        Formal Methods (FM) are mathematically-based techniques to model,
design, and analyze computing systems. Such techniques aim at improving the
dependability of computing systems. Different techniques may be required
throughout the development life cycle to cover the different aspects of the
system.
Heuristics, which depend upon and support machine learning models are of
general interest. In particular, AI-based methods for domain-specific
heuristic acquisition will be of interest. What do they contribute to the
problem-solving process? What do they make solvable, which would not be in
their absence? Which among a plethora of techniques for heuristic
acquisition are best and why (e.g., See the 1940s book, =E2=80=9CHow to Sol=
ve it,=E2=80=9D
by Polyga).
        Machine learning =E2=80=93 including the more-recent, deep neural n=
etworks,
match human abilities in various tasks. Solutions based on machine learning
are ubiquitous, from automated medical diagnosis and self-driving cars to
security. However, machine learning does not offer guarantees or reasoning
techniques to prove the dependability of the automated decisions. Such
systems must be verified/validated using existing techniques or call for
new techniques. Formal reasoning techniques are needed to arrive at as well
as to explain deductive and even inductive conclusions.  Explanation
subsystems have served expert systems in this capacity; but, what will fill
the gap for deep learning neural networks?
        The workshop seeks contributions from researchers and practitioners
interested in all aspects of integrated methods, either formal or
semi-formal, for system development covering all engineering development
phases from user requirements through validation/testing. The workshop
encourages contributions from new initiatives building bridges between FM
and machine learning =E2=80=93 especially contributions using FM as a tool =
to
verify safety-critical machine learning systems.  Moreover, logics for
learning and generalization =E2=80=93 possibly applied to the use of heuris=
tics
either in machine learning or in knowledge discovery are especially welcome=
.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
--------------------------------------------------
* Heuristic acquisition methods for data science
* Knowledge discovery
* Intelligent gradient descent for back-propagation
* Modelling uncertainty in deep learning
* Verification methodologies for machine learning
* Integration of deep learning modules for deeper learning
* Methods for, results in, and applications of auto-associative neural
network
* Axiomatic and denotational semantics for provable higher-level
specifications
* Predicate calculi for concept capture and resolution
* Integrated software/hardware specification and analysis
* Hybrid and embedded systems modeling and analysis
* Object and multi-agent systems modeling and analysis
* Requirement specification and analysis
* Software and hardware specification, verification, and validation
* Theorem proving and decision procedures
* Formal aspects of software evolution and maintenance
* Formal methods for re-engineering and reuse
* Randomization-based methods for simplification/optimization
* Formal languages integration
* Semi-formal (UML, SysML, =E2=80=A6) and formal model integration
* Informal and formal language integration
* Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
* Integrated analysis techniques
* Tools integration
* Integrated formal methods in education
* Integrated formal methods in health
* Integrated formal methods in industry
* Integrated formal methods in security

Paper submission
----------------
Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for
publication. Submissions will undergo a rigorous review process handled by
the Technical Program Committee. Papers will be selected based on their
originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Only
electronic submissions in PDF format through the EasyChair submission site
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfmi2019 will be considered. Paper=
s
must be in English, up to 8 pages in IEEE format, including references and
appendices. The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as
formatting guidelines, can be found on the paper submission instructions
available at the main conference website.

Paper Publication
-----------------
At least one of the authors must register and present each accepted paper.
Registered and presented papers will be published as workshop papers in the
IEEE IRI conference proceedings published by IEEE Computer Society Press
and included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. As for previous editions
of the workshop, authors of best papers will be invited to expand and
submit their papers for possible publication in a book or in a journal
special issue (pending approval).
