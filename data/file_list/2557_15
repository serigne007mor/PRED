Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the Call for Papers for the 2nd edition of=20
the workshop =E2=80=9CLarge-scale Industrial Time Series Analysis=E2=80=9D=
 (LITSA),=20
hosted by the IEEE ICDM 2021 conference in Auckland, New Zealand.

Workshop on Large-scale Industrial Time Series Analysis

https://lipn.github.io/LITSA2021/

In conjunction with: 21th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining=20
(ICDM 2021)

https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz/


*IMPORTANT DATES*

* Workshop paper submissions: *September 3, 2021*
* Workshop paper notification: September 24, 2021
* Camera-ready deadline and copyright forms: October 1, 2021
* Workshop date: December 7, 2021

By the unique ICDM tradition, all accepted workshop papers will be=20
published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE=20
Computer Society Press.

Papers must be formatted and written according to the Submission=20
Guidelines on the ICDM 2021 conference web site=20
(https://icdm2021.auckland.ac.nz/). You are strongly encouraged to print=20
and double check your PDF file before its submission, especially if your=20
paper contains Asian/European language symbols (such as Chinese/Korean=20
characters or English letters with European fonts).

SCOPE

One of the greatest challenges currently faced by experts, researchers=20
and data scientists is to efficiently explore potentially large amounts=20
of time series. Special care has been taken to analyze temporal data in=20
the last century, especially in the industrial domain: an attention that=20
skyrocketed along the ability to produce, collect and treat those data.=20
Nevertheless, time series analysis remains an open research subject, due=20
to the complexity of this data type and to the great amount of=20
information it contains. Developing general methods for large-scale time=20
series algorithms and data preprocessing is a pressing demand from=20
companies wishing to explore big data.

This workshop offers a meeting opportunity for academic and industry=20
researchers in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, data=20
visualization, data mining, data engineering and Big Data to discuss new=20
areas of learning methods dedicated to time series in industrial=20
environments. We encourage researchers and practitioners to submit=20
papers describing original research addressing time series and scalable=20
machine learning challenges.

This includes but is not restricted to the following topics:

  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Clustering and unsupervised learning
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Time Series Classification
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (Multivariate) Time Series Representations
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Deep learning approaches
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Online learning algorithms
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Mixture models and model-based methods
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Methods of detecting changes in evolving data (st=
reaming and
    time series)
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Visualization
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Theoretical frameworks for time series mining
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Scalable algorithms for big data
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Parallel and distributed computing for time serie=
s analytics
    (cloud, map-reduce, etc.)
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Interactive mining techniques
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Collaborative methods
  *  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Future research challenges of time series analysi=
s
