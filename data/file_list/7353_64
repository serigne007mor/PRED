Subject: [liste-egc] CFP-ExtendedDeadline: Collaborative Technology for
 Coordinating Crisis Management (CT2CM)

Collaborative Technology for Coordinating Crisis Management (CT2CM)
http://www.doesnotunderstand.org/wikka.php?wakka=3DCT2CM2012

track of WETICE-2012, Toulouse, France
(http://conf.laas.fr/wetice2012/)

This track will take place in Toulouse from June 25th to 27th 2012 during
the 21th IEEE International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and
Infrastructures (WETICE 2012).

Extended Deadline : March 26, 2012
Selected papers will be invited for a Special Issue in the
International Journal of Information Systems for Crisis Response and=20
Management (IJISCRAM)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------------------
Description

In crisis situations (natural or industrial disasters, riots, ...), the
different actors managing crisis resolution have to act simultaneously in
emergency situations to reduce its impacts on the real world. To achieve
this common goal as quickly and efficiently as possible, these actors
(police, military forces, medical organizations, NGOs but also emerging
groups) have to collaborate and act in a coordinated way. In the term
'coordination', we include all the work needed for the actors, for the
connected integration of their information systems and also for the
flexible synchronization of their efforts, in order to handle the crisis in
the most efficient way.

Coordination raises several problems such as the definition of the universe
of discourse, without which it would be impossible to solve the various
semantic conflicts that are bound to occur between several autonomous and
heterogeneous actors and their ISs. It involves the finding of partners,
emergent partners integration, their collective decisions, partners plans
negotiation and the synchronization of the distributed and concurrent
execution of their actions and plans.

Moreover, in a highly dynamic, open, unstable and uncertain environment,
such as the one met in crisis context, coordination should be redesigned to
be more reactive, pro-active, adaptive, robust and visible for all the
partners while preserving the essential part of their autonomy. It is
intended that this track should focus mainly on the benefits of adopting
collaborative enabling information technologies such as: Agent
based-systems, Collaborative BPMS, Semantic Web or Group Decision Support
Systems (DSS).

This track will try to address the following issues: how can collaborative
information technologies help with the coordination of Crisis Management ?
It is meant to cover the foundations, techniques, methodologies and
applications of Collaborative Information Technologies for Coordinating
Crisis Management. The track is interdisciplinary in nature and open to
contributions from fields as varied as Cooperative Information Systems,
Multi- Agent Systems, Business Process Management and the Semantic Web.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----------------------------------------
Track topics

Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Cooperative Information Gathering and Situation Awareness,
- Social Networks (media, citizens, ...) observations,
- Crisis Ontology,
- Adaptive and self-organization of the crisis management teams,
- Information System Interoperability and Inter-organizational issues,
- Group decision support,
- Crisis process design, enactment and adaptation,
- Agent models for : negotiation, trust, resource allocation, planning
and acting collaboratively,
- Crisis Management Systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Submissions guidelines

All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality,
relevance, significance, and clarity. At least three reviews for each paper
will be conducted. We are looking for submission of full research papers
and reports on field studies (up to 8 pages). All track papers should be
submitted electronically in PDF format through the Easychair website
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dct2cm2012 and should use the
IEEE US letter format. Every submitted paper will be evaluated by at least
three members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published
along with the WETICE 2011 proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
Note that at least one author from each accepted paper should register to
attend WETICE 2012 for the paper to be published in the proceedings.
