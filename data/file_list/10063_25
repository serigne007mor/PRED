Titre du stage : Evolution of scientific domains: a longitudinal=20=20
analysis

Supervision : J. Velcin, S. Loudcher

Place : University of Lyon

Duration : 6 months

Funding : ERIC Lab (~410 euros /month)

The Web makes the results and discoveries obtained through the=20=20
scientific progress much more available nowadays than in earlier=20=20
decades.
In particular, scientific articles are used by worldwide teams not=20=20
only for pursuing their own interests, but also for starting new=20=20
collaborations, creating special journal issues, and organizing=20=20
international conferences. These events seldom occur randomly: they=20=20
are often the result of preliminary works and transversal=20=20
collaborations. Researchers of the ERIC Lab are currently working on=20=20
the longitudinal analysis of bibliographic data, with a particular=20=20
interest in the diagnostics and prediction of such events.

In this context, the student's work will focus on the comparison of=20=20
existing techniques for analyzing the evolution of the scientific=20=20
literature. Different approaches can be tested and the student should=20=20
make a full state of the art. This includes, on the one hand, the=20=20
previous works dealing with bibliographic data (e.g., Klink et al.=20=20
2006, Za=EFane et al. 2009). On the other hand, she/he could see the=20=20
topic models developed more especially for text mining (e.g., Blei and=20=20
Lafferty 2006, Rosen-Zvi et al. 2010). These models are mainly focused=20=20
on the extraction of the main tendencies but could be extended to deal=20=20
with events (e.g., Allan 2002). Several packages are freely available=20=20
nowadays for testing these probabilistic models (for instance, see=20=20
Mallet http://mallet.cs.umass.edu).

In order to validate the chosen approaches, the student will have=20=20
access to various bibliographic databases, such as DBLP (http://www.informa=
tik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db=20
) or Pascal (http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/DataBase/214.jsp). The=20=20
comparison will be based on purely predictive quantitative measures,=20=20
such as perplexity, but also on human judgment (e.g., Boyd-Graber et=20=20
al., 2009). Recent work on topic extraction evaluation has been done=20=20
in the lab (Musat et al. 2011, Rizoiu and Velcin 2011) ; it can be=20=20
used as a start by the student.

The second stage of this internship consists in focusing on one=20=20
interesting event: emergence of a new topic, publication of an=20=20
original paper, creation of a new community, etc. To begin with, we=20=20
propose to follow a purely descriptive approach in order to build an=20=20
explanation of the occurrence of this particular event. The last stage=20=20
will draw future lines of research for developing new machine learning=20=20
models dealing with scientific events.
These (future) models must be able to handle the different actors who=20=20
populate a research domain: articles, authors, journals, conferences=20=20
etc.=
