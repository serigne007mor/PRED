TOPIC SUMMARY:

The growing availability of multi-faceted relational data gives rise to
unprecedented opportunities for unveiling complex real-world behaviors and
phenomena. This also supports the proliferation of complex network models
where the expressive power of the graph-based relational structure is
enhanced through exposing several types of features that are peculiar of
the domain-specific environment (e.g., social media platforms, biological
environment, geographical location, etc.). Examples of this kind of
feature-rich networks include Heterogeneous information networks,
Multilayer networks, Temporal networks, Location-aware networks, and
Probabilistic networks.

The aim of this Special Issue, titled "Reloading Feature-rich Information
Networks", is to address challenging issues and emerging trends in
feature-rich information networks that can be mined in several domains,
including not only long studied contexts such as social media and biology,
but also less investigated or even new frontiers for network science, such
as finance, engineering, archaeology, geology, astronomy, and many others.
Although the use of feature-rich networks can intuitively be perceived as
beneficial for most research tasks based on graph data, their expressive
power has not been yet fully valued in most domains, therefore there is an
emergence for providing insights into how the study of complex network
models can pave the way for solving domain-specific problems that might not
be adequately addressed by existing graph models.

Within this view, we solicit contributions on advanced modeling and mining
of feature-rich networks, regarding any data domain, including both
theoretical and application-oriented studies. In particular, we encourage
contributions on the development of novel approaches based on advanced
optimization techniques and learning paradigms (e.g., online learning,
reinforcement learning, and deep learning) to enhance our understanding of
complex phenomena in information networks, but also visionary works about
alternative modeling and mining approaches for complex networks.

The topics of interest for this special issue include, but are not limited
to:
_ Foundations of Learning and Mining in feature-rich networks
_ Simplification/pruning/sampling of feature-rich networks
_ Embedding and Deep Learning in feature-rich networks
_ Centrality and Ranking in feature-rich networks
_ Vertex similarity in multiplex and feature-rich networks
_ Community Detection in feature-rich networks
_ Link Prediction in feature-rich networks
_ Multiplex and feature-rich networks evolution models
_ Ensemble learning for feature-rich networks mining
_ Pattern mining in feature-rich networks
_ User Behavior Modeling in feature-rich networks
_ Influence propagation in feature-rich networks
_ Reputation and Trust computing in feature-rich networks
_ Probabilistic and Uncertain feature-rich networks
_ Time-evolving feature-rich networks
_ Hypergraph-based modeling, analysis and learning problems
_ Cross-Domain problems in feature-rich networks
_ Mobility in feature-rich networks
_ Visualization of feature-rich networks
