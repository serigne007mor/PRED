Call for papers
RULE 2010

Eleventh International Workshop on Rule-Based Specification and Programming
Rule-Based Programming in Industry and the Semantic Web
Edinburgh, UK
July 14, 2010

Workshop affiliated to FLoC 2010 as post-conference event of RTA 2010

http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/twiki/bin/view/Events/RULE2010/WebHome

With the renewed interest in rule-based computing for industrial 
applications (e.g., Business Rules) especially
as it relates to the Semantic Web ( e.g., the W3C's Rule Interchange 
Format), it is timely to explore the
practical benefits delivered by computing with rules and ontologies in 
the large. Thus, this year's theme will
focus on rule-based programming in Industry and the Semantic Web. The 
emphasis will be on implemented systems
that have been actually used in pragmatic situations where the 
advantages of rule-driven computation and
inference have made all the difference, such advantages being:

    * agility
    * declarativeness
    * maintainability
    * documentability
    * scalability
    * meta-programmability
    * reliability
    * formal semantics
    * etc., ...

In terms of the Semantic Web, we explicitly call for submissions that 
probe (in a pragmatic setting) how
rule-based approaches complement ontology-based approaches, which share 
some of the characteristics of rule
 systems, such as declarativeness and formal semantics.

Paper submission

We are solliciting papers dealing with topics related to this year's 
theme discussing any or several of
the itemized facets of the combinations of rules and ontologies, going 
beyond academic experiments and
meant for large-scale or industrial applications. Papers should contain 
no more than 10 pages, including
figures, and submitted through EasyChair using the standard EPTCS LaTeX 
style file.
