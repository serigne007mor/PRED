 Belgium on Model-Driven Engineering and Web-based Interfaces

University of Namur // Namur Digital Institute (NADI)

Supervisors: Moussa Amrani, Gilles Perrouin and Pierre-Yves Schobbens.

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) make use of Model-Driven Engineering
techniques
to capture the essence of an expertise domain, and provide deep automation
in
repetitive tasks such as animation, documentation, analyses and code
generation.
DSL users need powerful workbenches and editors to create new instances of
their
DSL, as well as performing routine tasks to ensure the correctness and the
deployment of their models. Textual editors are nowadays easily
customisable and
support workbench deployment in a timely and efficient way.

Visual editors, on the contrary, are way more difficult to build, although
recent research demonstrated substantial progress in recent years. Another
difficult current challenge lies in animating those models in complex,
interactive scenarios where automated transformations take place, but
end-users
inputs are also required. Ensuring that animations react in real-time,
without
loss of information and in synch with potentially different views of the
same
model represent new features that are necessary to tackle for ensuring wide
adoption of visual DSLs.

A recent trend nowadays is to embed visual editors into web browsers (in
order
to, for example, simplifying the access to the editor, facilitating the
update
of new versions, or enabling collaborative work).

The project takes place in an industrial collaboration with CodingPark, a
company based in Paris that creates educative online games.
(http://codingpark.io/)


We are looking for a Post-Doc candidate with the following skills:

- Knowledge of Language Theory: syntax, operational semantics,
textual/graphical
editors, compilers/interpreters, debuggers;

- Knowledge of model transformation frameworks (Kermeta, Epsilon, etc.) and
DSL
frameworks (Xtext, GeMoC);

- Theoretical background in model animation, model synchronisation;

- Technical skills for web-based development (WebGL, Canvas);

- Autonomy in daily work;

- Ability to work within a small team, and with an international network of
collaborators;

- Aiming at regularly publishing in top venues;

- Excellent English skills (both spoken and written) for scientific
communication (although French is used every day).

The position will be held in the Faculty of Computer Science of the
University
of Namur, inside the PReCiSE Group, part of the Namur Digital Institute
(NaDI).

Namur is the capital of Wallonia, the french-speaking region of Belgium.
It is
a charming and affordable midsize city situated 45 min south from Brussels
and
within 3 hours from the Paris, London, Amsterdam and Bonn.

The funding is a scholarship provided by the Ceruna non-profit association,
for
a duration of one year, with a possible extension of one year (for a total
of
two fully-funded years), and amounts around 2.500 =E2=82=AC/month, tax-free=
.

For more information on the research and/or the position, please contact
Moussa
Amrani (Moussa.Amrani@unamur.be), Gilles Perrouin (Gilles.Perrouin@unamur.b=
e
),
or Pierre-Yves Schobbens (Pierre-Yves.Schobbens@unamur.be) including a copy
of
your CV.

Screening of potential candidate will start immediately until the position
is
filled. Formal application requires:

* A full CV, including a publication list;

* A Cover Letter of max. 2 pages describing your skills, experience, and
why you
are the best candidate to hire for this project;

* A Copy of the Ph.D diploma (or report, if diploma not available yet);

* Optionally, some recommendation letters (up to three).

Please use "CERUNA WebDSML" in your email's subject to facilitate its
processing.

The University of Namur promotes diversity in employment and welcomes
applications from all sections of the community.
