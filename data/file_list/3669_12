- Beyond Facts -
2nd International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse 
Analysis (KnOD)


Collocated with TheWebConf (WWW) 2022 -- online event --
25-29 April 2022 - Lyon, France

https://knod22.wordpress.com/


SUMMARY

Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to 
the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims 
and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts 
(events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights 
for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo 
chambers or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs promise to 
provide the key to a Web of structured information, they are mainly 
focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity, connection or 
temporal evolution of online discourse data. As opposed to facts, claims 
are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on 
the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where 
terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across 
communities from computational social science, to argumentation mining, 
fact-checking, or viewpoint/stance detection.

This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these 
communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, 
extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the 
need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse 
data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and 
reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the 
analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into 
information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling 
for KG building, the workshop targets communities focusing on the 
analysis of online discourse, relying on methods from machine learning, 
natural language processing and Web data mining. These include 
communities on:

* discourse analysis
* social web mining
* argumentation mining
* computational fact-checking
* mis- and dis-information spread
* bias and controversy detection and analysis
* stance / viewpoint detection and representation
* opinion mining
* rumour, propaganda and hate-speech detection
* computational journalism

KnOD provides a meeting point for these related but distinct communities 
that address similar or closely related questions from different 
perspectives and in different fields, using different models and 
definitions of the main notions of interest. Often these communities 
apply their research in particular domains, such as scientific 
publishing, medicine, journalism or social science. Therefore, the 
workshop is particularly interested in works that apply an 
interdisciplinary approach, such as works on computational social 
sciences or computational journalism.
