August 30 =88 September 3, 2010 Daegu, Korea

As part of The 11th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial=20
Intelligence

Introduction:

=8CThe 9th International Workshop on Knowledge Management and Acquisition=
=20
for Smart Systems and Services (PKAW 2010)=82 has provided a forum for the=
=20
past two decades for researchers and practitioners working in the area=20
of machine intelligence. PKAW covers a spectrum of techniques and=20
approaches to implement smartness in IT applications. With the growing=20
recognition of the pivotal role that smartness plays in the=20
sustainability, competitiveness and growth of an organisation, together=20
with the difficulties associated with effectively managing knowledge,=20
finding solutions to address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is=20
even more important in today=82s society than in the early beginnings of=20
this field. This workshop will explore and disseminate the latest solutions.

Machine intelligence solutions incorporating other areas of AI such as=20
ontological engineering, agent-based technology, robotics, image=20
recognition and the Semantic Web are common, as are knowledge=20
acquisition methods related to other fields of computing such as=20
software engineering, security, databases, the Internet, information=20
retrieval, language technology and game technology. Many solutions are=20
application focussed addressing real world problems such as knowledge=20
reuse, sharing, merging and reconciliation within a wide range of=20
problem domains.
