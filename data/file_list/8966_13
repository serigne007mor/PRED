**********************************************************************************************************************
		4th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL & DATA ENGINEERING (MEDI 2014)
		Lordos Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus
		24-26 September, 2014
			http://medi2014.cs.ucy.ac.cy/
**********************************************************************************************************************


*Important Dates

Full-paper submission: May 9, 2014 (extended deadline)
Acceptance notification: June 16, 2014
Camera Ready: July 7, 2014*


*Paper Publication

All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.**
Best papers will be invited for submission in a:
*

 1. *Future Generation Computer Systems (Elsevier),
    *
 2. *International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems (World
    Scientific) and
    *
 3. *Fundamenta Informaticae (IOS Press). *


The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of
research accomplishments and to promote the interaction
and collaboration of research communities issued from modelling and system
modelling on the one hand and data and data modelling on the other hand.
MEDI 2014 provides an international infrastructure for the presentation of
research results and experimentations on models and data theory, development of
advanced technologies related to models and data and their
advanced applications and case studies. This international scientific event,
initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at
promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and
faculty/student exchanges and of other parts of the world as well.


Keynote Speakers

Mukesh Mohania, IBM India: Talk on the data side
Dominique Mery, Loria, Nancy, France: Talk on the model side

Submission Guidelines and Instructions

Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing
original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or
Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should
not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices).
Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages with
the indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the paper is
accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which
do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra page purchase
commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and
clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Duplicate submissions are not
allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if it is
submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already
accepted to be published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate
submissions thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions
require explicit consent from all listed authors.
