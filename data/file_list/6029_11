Second Workshop on Smart daTa integRation And Processing on Service =

(STRAPS 2020)
December 14th, 2020 Dubai, United Arab Emirates (ON LINE)
              website: https://straps-workshop.github.io

**************************************************************************=
*********

Given that the general conference ICSOC and STRAPS have gone officially =
online, organisers have
authorised a longer period of submission for workshops. Therefore we =
have
decided to organise 3 submission rounds with the following deadlines:

- 1 round:=20
Submission: 5th September=20
Notification of results: 20th September

- 2 round:=20
Submission: 5th October
Notification of results: 25th October

- 3 round:=20
Submission: 30th October
Notification of results: 15th November

Papers submitted and marginally evaluated in the first/second rounds =
will have to opportunity to be submitted again in the following rounds. =
Authors will be able to integrate evaluation comments from reviewers to =
prepare a new submission.

Workshop overview

More than ever, reducing the cost of data integration by efficiently =
evaluating queries is an important challenge, given that today the =
economic cost in computing cycles (see your cloud invoice); and in =
energy consumption and the performance required for some critical tasks =
have become important. Besides, new applications require solving even =
more complex queries including millions of sources, and data with high =
levels of volume and variety. These new challenges call for intelligent =
processes that can learn from previous experiences, that can be =
adaptable to changing requirements and dynamic execution contexts.

This workshop follows a first successful edition in conjunction with =
ICSOC 2019 in Toulouse that led to a vivid program with interesting =
discussion (http://straps.imag.fr). The second edition of the workshop =
STRAPS aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data produced =
under different conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer =
simple, relational, analytical queries. These queries must cope to =
quality preferences associated with providers, algorithms and data =
trust. New scales in volume, velocity and value associated with =
integrated data collections require adapted solutions providing =
computing, storage and processing services potentially deployed on =
different highly distributed infrastructures and target architectures. =
With service, data and algorithms stemming from different and =
potentially huge numbers of providers, properties like provenance, =
quality and trust, arise as key properties to be quantified, evaluated =
and exposed to data consumers. How can data integration in such =
conditions be smart? This is the key question to be discussed by =
workshop participants.

Underlying approaches and algorithms continue to evolve particularly =
given the new levels of volume, velocity and value associated with data. =
Contemporary infrastructures for dealing with data are deployed in =
heterogeneous target architectures like cloud, multi-cloud, Internet of =
Things consisting of sensors and server farms deployed around the world. =
These infrastructures go beyond classic data management solutions and =
evolve towards different stacks configurations (data processing systems =
=E2=80=9Ca la carte=E2=80=9D).  They need to cope with new notions of =
scalability and of resources consumption guided by economic models, =
service level agreements and other quality warranties.

The workshop aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data =
stemming from different providers and produced under different =
conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, =
analytical queries ensuring providers, algorithms and data trust.=20

Topics of interest

We invite the submission of work-in-progress research addressing various =
aspects of data integration and processing done in service based =
infrastructures. The workshop welcomes submissions of technical, =
experimental, methodological papers, application papers, and papers on =
experience reports in real-life application settings addressing =C3=A2=E2=82=

Submission instructions
We expect papers written in English between 8 and 12 Springer=E2=80=99s =
LNCS pages long (Springer LNCS format =
https://www.springer.com/fr/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-g=
uidelines), including references and Illustrations. Electronic =
submissions in PDF format can be proposed at =
(http://www.conftool.com/icsoc2020/index.php)

			 =20

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should =
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and =
attend the workshop to present the paper. Registration is subject to the =
terms and conditions of ICSOC.

A selected number of papers will be invited to be submitted as extended =
versions to be published in an edition of Proceedings series =C2=AB =
Advances in Computer Science Research.
