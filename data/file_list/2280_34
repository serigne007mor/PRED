Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the Call for Papers for the 1st edition of=20
the workshop =E2=80=9CLarge-scale Industrial Time Series Analysis=E2=80=9D=
 (LITSA),=20
hosted by the IEEE ICDM 2020 conference in Sorrento, Italy.

IEEE ICDM '20

Workshop on Large-scale Industrial Time Series Analysis
In conjunction with: 20th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining=20
(ICDM 2020)
Workshop website: https://lipn.github.io/LITSA2020/


_IMPORTANT DATES__
_

*-=C2=A0 August 24, 2020: Workshop papers submission**
**- September 17, 2020: Notification of workshop papers acceptance to=20
authors**
**- September 24, 2020: Camera-ready deadline and copyright form**
**- November 17, 2020: Workshops date*

Papers must be formatted and written according to the Submission=20
Guidelines on the ICDM 2020 conference web site. You are strongly=20
encouraged to print and double check your PDF file before its=20
submission, especially if your paper contains Asian/European language=20
symbols (such as Chinese/Korean characters or English letters with=20
European fonts).

_SCOPE_


One of the greatest challenges currently faced by experts, researchers=20
and data scientists is to efficiently explore potentially large amounts=20
of time series. Special care has been taken to analyze temporal data in=20
the last century, especially in the industrial domain: an attention that=20
skyrocketed along the ability to produce, collect and treat those data.=20
Nevertheless, time series analysis remains an open research subject, due=20
to the complexity of this data type and to the great amount of=20
information it contains. Developing general methods for large-scale time=20
series algorithms and data preprocessing is a pressing demand from=20
companies wishing to explore big data.

This workshop offers a meeting opportunity for academic and industry=20
researchers in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, data=20
visualization, data mining, data engineering and Big Data to discuss new=20
areas of learning methods dedicated to time series in industrial=20
environments. We encourage researchers and practitioners to submit=20
papers describing original research addressing time series and scalable=20
machine learning challenges.

This includes but is not restricted to the following topics:

  * Clustering and unsupervised learning
  * Time Series Classification
  * (Multivariate) Time Series Representations
  * Deep learning approaches
  * Online learning algorithms
  * Mixture models and model-based methods
  * Methods of detecting changes in evolving data (streaming and time
    series)
  * Visualization
  * Theoretical frameworks for time series mining
  * Scalable algorithms for big data
  * Parallel and distributed computing for time series analytics (cloud,
    map-reduce, etc.)
  * Interactive mining techniques
  * Collaborative methods
  * Future research challenges of time series analysis


_Organizing Committee_

Florent Forest (Safran Aircraft Engines)
Etienne Goffinet (Groupe Renault)
Hanane Azzag (Sorbonne Paris Nord University)
Mustapha Lebbah (Sorbonne Paris Nord University)

We look forward to exchanging around these topics at ICDM and reading=20
your submissions,

Regards,

LITSA Workshop Organizing Team,
