**********************************************************

We invite you to participate in EuroVis 2010, to be held in
Bordeaux, France, June 9-11, 2010. EuroVis 2010 is the
twelfth annual Visualization Symposium, jointly organized
by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization and
the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee.
Papers accepted for EuroVis will be published in a special
issue of Computer Graphics Forum, the International Journal
of the Eurographics Association, using a two-stage review process.
Papers should be at most 9 pages excluding references and at
most 10 pages including references.

Important dates:
 Nov 27 2009: Abstracts due
 Dec 4  2009: Full papers due
 Feb 12 2010: First reviewing cycle notifications announced
 Mar 5  2010: Second reviewing cycle papers due
 Mar 19 2010: Final decisions announced
 Apr 9  2010: Poster submissions due
 Apr 23 2010: Poster notifications announced

Suggested topics for research papers include, but are not limited to:

 * Visualization Taxonomies and Models

 * Spatial Data in Visualization: scalar, vector and tensor fields,
   multi-field and multi-variate, multi-dimensional, multi-resolution,
   irregular and unstructured grids, geographic data, molecular data

 * Non-Spatial Data (Information Visualization): graphs and trees,
   high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction, ambient information,
   text and documents, time series data

 * Visualization Techniques: metrical, geometrical, topological,
   pixel-oriented, point-based, volume-based, icon- and glyph-based,
   graph-based, feature-based, hierarchical, illustrative,
   view-dependent, focus + context, statistical graphics, animation

 * Interaction: human-computer interaction, interaction design,
   zooming and navigation, linking + brushing, coordinated multiple
   views, data editing, manipulation and deformation

 * Visual Analytics, Visual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery

 * Large Data Visualization: time-varying data, streams, compression,
   parallel and distributed, scalability, visualization over networks

 * Hardware for Visualization: visualization hardware,
   hardware/GPU acceleration, volume hardware, display devices,
   haptics for visualization

 * General Topics: visual design, cognition, perception, aesthetics,
   uncertainty, design studies, novel algorithms and mathematics,
   presentation/production/dissemination, collaborative and distributed,
   mobile/ubiquitous, visualization systems, problem-solving
   environments, virtual environments, visualization for the masses,
   sonification

 * Evaluation and User Studies: task and requirements analysis,
   metrics and benchmarks, qualitative evaluation, quantitative
   evaluation, laboratory studies, field studies, usability studies

 * Application Areas of Visualization: physical sciences,
   bioinformatics and life sciences, engineering, geographic,
   earth/space/environmental, information sciences, software,
   financial, humanities, social sciences, education


Co-located Event: EuroVAST 2010

EuroVAST 2010 is the first international symposium on visual
analytics science and technology held in Europe. The goal of
the symposium is to promote and advance the combination and
integration of visualization and analytics methods for the purpose
of problem solving in a variety of application domains
(engineering, business, public policy, medicine, security, etc).
EuroVAST will be held on June 8, 2010 in Bordeaux, France,
co-located with the annual EuroVis 2010 Conference. The EuroVAST
program will feature a number of invited speakers from research
and industry as well as a poster program. Full papers should
be submitted to the EuroVis conference, which solicits visual
analytics as one of the core paper topics. EuroVAST is sponsored
by the European Coordination Action "VisMaster: Visual Analytics -
Mastering the Information Age" in cooperation with Eurographics.

Poster Submission Deadline for EuroVAST: February 15, 2010
