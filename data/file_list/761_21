    Our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this CFP.
    We will greatly appreciate it if you can share this information with yo=

    This is to inform you that due to several=20
    requests ACKE'07 paper submission deadline has=20
    been extended to March 26, 2007. For your=20
    information the Call for Papers is appended.

    Accepted papers will be invited to further revise and extend their work=
 in a special issue of "International Journal of Computing and Information=

    Call for papers for the 1st International Workshop on "Advances in Conc=
eptual
    Knowledge Engineering"
    in conjunction with DEXA 2007



    http://www.dexa.org



    Regensburg, Germany

    3-7 September 2007


    Organised by: Sadok Ben Yahia (Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, Tunisia), =
Jean Diatta (IREMIA, La R=E9union Island, France) and Engelbert Mephu Nguif=
o (CRIL, France)



    Knowledge engineering (KE) consists in building, maintaining and develo=
ping knowledge-based systems. It has a great deal in common with software e=
ngineering,=20

    and is related to many computer science domains such as artificial inte=
lligence, databases, data mining, expert systems, decision support systems,=
 user=20

    modelling, web technologies, computational linguistics and geographic i=
nformation systems.=20


    Knowledge engineering is also related to mathematical logic, as well as=
 strongly involved in cognitive science and socio-cogintive engineering whe=
re the=20

    knowledge is produced by socio-cognitive aggregates (mainly humans) and=
 is structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and lo=
gic works.=20

    Various activities of KE specific for the development of a knowledge-ba=
sed system: Assessment of the problem; Development of a knowledge-based sys=
tem=20

    shell/structure; Implementation of the structured knowledge into knowle=
dge-bases; Acquisition and structuring of the related information, knowledg=
e and=20

    specific preferences; Testing and validation of the inserted knowledge;=
 Integration and maintenance of the system; Revision and evaluation of the =
system.=20

    Being still more art than engineering, KE is not as neat as the above l=
ist in practice. The phases overlap, the process might be iterative, and ma=
ny=20

    challenges could appear. Recently, emerges meta-knowledge engineering a=
s a new formal systemic approach to the development of an unified knowledge=
 and=20

    intelligence theory.

    Conceptual knowledge engineering aims to put more emphasis on the inter=
relationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enabl=
e them to=20

    function togetherduring the KE process. One major goal here is to focus=
 the KE process onto the design of conceptual models, methods and structure=
s. Our=20

    objective in this workshop is to provide information on recent advances=
 on KE using conceptual similarity-based measures, concept lattices, concep=
tual=20

    graphs, rough sets, description logics, concept mapping, ontologies and=
 more, in both theoretical and applicational aspects of KE.


    The ultimate aim of this workshop is to provide state-of-the-art inform=
ation to academics, researchers, and industry practitioners whom are involv=
ed or=20

    interested in both theoretical and applicational aspects of conceptual =
knowledge engineering. Prospective authors are invited to submit original a=
nd=20

    previously unpublished research showing related to the following topics=
:=20

    * Conceptual structures,=20
    *Relationship of FCA with other methods of data analysis (clustering, a=
ssociation rules, classification, etc.),=20
    *Data for Formal Concept Analysis (object-attribute data, pre-processin=
g of data, conceptual scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.),=20
    * Applications FCA on semantic web and ontologies,=20

    Instructions for authors and Important dates


    Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research and applic=
ation
    papers that are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will
    be limited to 5 two-column pages (IEEE Proceeding style) including figu=
res
    and references. Please comply with the IEEE Computer Society Press Proc=
eedings
    Author Guidelines to prepare your papers. Electronic submission
    of manuscripts (in postscript, word or pdf format) is required and will=
 be
    handled via the workshop Web site (to be announced soon). For any furth=
er
    inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact the workshop organizers.
    In addition, at least one author of each accepted paper is required to =
attend
    the conference and present the paper. Papers accepted for presentation
    will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press as proceedings of the
    DEXA 2007 workshops.


    **Important dates:

    Deadline for authors to submit papers: March 26th, 2007
