The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or =
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in =
the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn =
Shafer as a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty. These =
early contributions have been the starting points of many important =
developments, including the Transferable Belief Model and the Theory of =
Hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a =
general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well =
understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, =
possibility and imprecise probability theories.=20

The biennial BELIEF conferences (sponsored by the Belief Functions and =
Applications Society https://www.bfasociety.org/) are dedicated to the =
confrontation of ideas, the reporting of recent achievements and the =
presentation of the wide range of applications of this theory. The first =
edition of this conference series was held in Brest, France, in 2010, =
the second edition in Compi=C3=A8gne, France, in 2012, the third edition =
in Oxford, UK, in 2014, the fourth edition in Prague, Czech Republic, in =
2016, and the fifth edition in Compi=C3=A8gne, France, in 2018. The =
Sixth International Conference on Belief Functions (BELIEF 2020) will be =
held in Shanghai, China, on October 23-25, 2020. It will be co-located =
with the 2020 International Conference on Cognitive analytics, Granular =
computing, and Three-way decisions (CCGT). The co-location of the two =
events is intended to favour cross-fertilization among researchers =
active in both communities.

be found on SpringerLink.

Authors should consult Springer=E2=80=99s authors=E2=80=99 guidelines =
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for =
the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include =
their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of =
each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must =
complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author =
signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked =
on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes =
relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
