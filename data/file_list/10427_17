Subject: [liste-egc] CFP:  ESANN 2015 special session on "Graphs in machine
 learning"

Apologies for cross-posting.

We invite researchers in statistics and/or machine learning to submit
papers in the special session “graphs in machine learning”
(https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/esann/index.php?pg=specsess) of the ESANN
conference (European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks
https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/esann/) that will be held in the city of
Bruges (Belgium) from the 22nd to the 24th of April.

* Graphs in machine learning

* Organized by Pierre Latouche, Fabrice Rossi (Univ. Paris 1
Panthéon-Sorbonne, France)

* Abstract

Graphs are commonly used to characterise interactions between objects of
interest. Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they
are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical
sciences. In Biology for instance, metabolic networks can describe
pathways of biochemical reactions, while in social sciences networks are
used to represent relation ties between actors.

In this special session, we are interested in methods relying on graphs
for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods.
Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in
latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting
knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only
applicable on static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time,
recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with
evolving networks.

In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or
numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they
are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of
information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally
or globally.

In both contexts, supervised and unsupervised, data can be relational
(augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or
graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a
full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this
context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing
clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph),
graph classification, etc.

* Topics

We invite papers on graphs in machine learning. In particular, topics of
interest include:

 - Community detection
 - Random graph models
 - Graph clustering
 - Graph visualisation
 - Graph matching
 - Evolving networks

* Submission

Papers should be submitted through the ESANN website following the
instructions given here:
http://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/esann/index.php?pg=submission.

* Important dates

Paper submission deadline : 21 November 2014
Notification of acceptance : 31 January 2015
ESANN 2015 conference : 22-24 April 2015
