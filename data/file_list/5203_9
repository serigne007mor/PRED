AIMS AND SCOPE

Text are important sources of information and communication in diverse=20
domains. The intelligent, efficient and secure use of this information=20
requires, in most cases, the transformation of unstructured textual data=20
into data sets with some structure, and organized according to an=20
appropriate schema that follows the semantics of an application domain.=20
Indeed, solving the problems of modern society requires=20
interdisciplinary research and information cross-referencing, thus=20
surpassing the simple provision of unstructured data. There is a need=20
for representations that are more flexible, subtle and=20
context-sensitive, which can also be easily accessible via consultation=20
tools and evolve according to these principles. In this context,=20
consultation requires robust and efficient processing of requests, which=20
may involve information analysis, with quality, consistency, and privacy=20
preservation guarantees. Knowledge bases can be built as these new=20
generation infrastructures which support data science queries on a=20
user-friendly framework and are capable of providing the required=20
machinery for advised decision-making.

The workshop focuses on transforming data into information and then into=20
knowledge. The idea is to gather researchers in NLP (Natural Language=20
Processing), DB (Databases), and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to discuss=20
two main problems :

- how to extract information from textual data and represent it in=20
knowledge bases;
- how to propose intelligent methods for handling and maintaining these=20
databases with new forms of requests, including efficient, flexible, and=20
secure analysis mechanisms, adapted to the user, and with quality and=20
privacy preservation guarantees.

This workshop focuses on all aspects concerning these modern=20
infrastructures, giving particular attention (but not limited to) to=20
data related to health and environmental domains.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
