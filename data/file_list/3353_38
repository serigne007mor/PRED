 2022)

***New paper submission deadline: April 1st, 2022***

2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SERVICES (ICWS 2022)
PART OF THE 2022 IEEE WORLD CONGRESS ON SERVICES (SERVICES 2022)

July 10-16, 2022 (Hybrid)
in Barcelona, Spain (Pending Travel and CDC Guidelines)

***ABOUT IEEE ICWS AND IEEE SERVICES CONGRESS***

The 2022 IEEE World Congress on Services will be held in a hybrid mode 
with physical presence in Barcelona, Spain. The Congress is solely 
sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the 
Technical Committee on Services Computing (TCSVC). The scope of the 
Congress will cover all aspects of services computing and applications, 
current or emerging. Centered around services computing, it covers 
various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and 
Internet-of-Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent 
computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing 
critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, 
privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. 
Particularly, 2022 Congress welcomes papers on the impact of COVID-19 on 
services and corresponding infrastructure. In addition to colocated 
theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and 
workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, 
and complement the Congress program with industry and application 
presentations and panels. Authors are invited to submit original papers 
to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted 
manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted 
and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published 
by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

The IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) is the flagship 
conference focusing on Web-based services, featuring services modeling, 
development, publishing, discovery, recommendation, composition, 
testing, adaptation, and delivery, and Web services applications and 
standards.
