Program & Speaker Info
----------------------
10:00-11:15 EDT / 14:00-15:15 UTC / 16:00-17:15 / 16:00-17:15 SAST
(50 min talk + discussion)

Title: The psychology and philosophy of concept combination

Speaker:
James Hampton (City, University of London, UK) [3]

SPECIAL SESSION of ESAO:
- invited talk in connection with the PhD defense of Guendalina Rhigett=
i (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy)
- actually hybrid, onsite in Bozen-Bolzano and online as ESAO webinar
- format: scientific talk

Abstract:
I will review a wider range of research into the problem of how prototy=
pe concepts combine. When nouns are placed in a noun-noun compound, (e.=
g. CRIMINAL LAWYER) different strategies can be used in English to arri=
ve at a semantic interpretation. I will discuss some of the processes i=
nvolved, and the effects of stress. The second part of my talk will exa=
mine how people interpret logical connectives when applied to vague sem=
antic categories such as Vehicle or Fruit. Finally I will present some =
new data looking at how people judge a conjunction of two vague predica=
tes, as in "These sunglasses are large and dark" where both size and sh=
ade of a set of sunglasses are distributed around a vague boundary.

Short Speaker CV:
Educated at Cambridge and University College London. Professor of Psych=
ology, City, University of London since 1977. Visiting appointments at =
Stanford, Cornell, Chicago (as a Fulbright Fellow), Yale, NYU, Ecole No=
rmale Superieure in Paris, and Utrecht. Over 100 publications on the ps=
ychology and philosophy of concepts.


Series Description
------------------

The IAOA [4] has created ESAO [1], an educational effort directed towar=
ds topics of Applied Ontology, primarily established basics and foundat=
ions.

The series is inspired by the Interdisciplinary Schools on Applied Onto=
logy (ISAO) [5] (for the next ISAO edition during July 10-14, 2023, ple=
ase see [6] - ! EARLY REGISTRATION for ISAO 2023 closes on June 11 (EDT=

iscussing that material.
