CALL FOR PAPERS

"Second Edition of the Workshop on Interactions between Data Mining and 
Natural Language Processing"
(DMNLP'2015)

ECML/PKDD 2015 Workshop

September 7, 2015, Porto, Portugal

******************************************************************

DMNLP'15 will be the second edition of the Data Mining and Natural 
Language Processing (DMNLP) workshop and will be held in conjunction 
with ECML-PKDD 2015 in Porto, Portugal. The previous edition, DMNLP'14, 
was held in conjunction with the ECML-PKDD 2014 in Nancy, France.

******
SCOPE
******

On the one hand, in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
numerical Machine Learning methods (e.g., SVM, CRF) have been 
intensively explored and applied. Despite the good results obtained by 
the numerical methods, one major drawback is that they do not provide a 
human readable model. A promising direction is the integration of 
symbolic knowledge.

On the other hand, research in Data Mining has progressed significantly 
in the last decades, through the development of advanced algorithms and 
techniques to extract knowledge from data in different forms. In 
particular, for two decades Pattern Mining has been one of the most 
active field in Knowledge Discovery.

Recently, a new field has emerged taking benefit of both domains: Data 
Mining and NLP. The objective of DMNLP is thus to provide a forum to 
discuss how Data Mining can be interesting for NLP tasks, providing 
symbolic knowledge, but also how NLP can enhance data mining approaches 
by providing richer and/or more complex information to mine and by 
integrating linguistics knowledge directly in the mining process.

The workshop aims at bringing together researchers from both communities 
in order to stimulate discussions about the cross-fertilization of those 
two research fields. The idea of this workshop is to discuss future 
directions and new challenges emerging from the cross-fertilization of 
Data Mining and NLP and in the same time initiate collaborations between 
researchers of both communities.

***************
CALL FOR PAPERS
***************

The workshop promotes works where the two following dimensions are 
combined in one as symbiosis.

The first dimension is Data Mining, for instance Pattern Mining 
(itemsets, sequences, trees, graphs, association rules), classification 
(decision trees, FCA,...), inductive logic programming.

The second dimension is NLP, for example question/answering systems, 
translation, information extraction, linguistic analysis (lexical 
analysis, terminology, syntax, semantics, discourse, stylistics), 
classification, knowledge extraction/ontology building from texts, 
information retrieval, corpus annotation, social/opinion mining.


A list of non-exhaustive topics that fit the scope of the workshop is thus:

- Pattern discovery for NLP
- Constraint-based pattern mining in text
- Data mining query languages for expressing NLP tasks
- Data representation (sequence, tree, graphs) for NLP
- Modelization of text for data mining
- Relationships between data mining and NLP
- Modeling and visualizing data mining results on text
- Integrating NLP characteristics in data mining
- Data mining approaches for linguistic knowledge building
- Knowledge discovery for linguistic analysis (e.g. stylistic, 
socio-linguistics,…)
- Linguistically-informed text representations for Data Mining


Our main goal is to stimulate discussion, collaboration and the sharing 
of experiences.
In that respect, we would have three submission types:

- unpublished works (max 8 pages, double submissions allowed)
- extended abstracts and vision statements (max 4 pages)
- recently published works (special oral-only track, no page limits)


For more details on submission, see the DMNLP webpage at
