Subject: [liste-egc] ICSOC 2014, Paris - Call For Workshop Proposals

===========================
ICSOC 2014
Paris, November 3-6, 2014
===========================


Call For Workshop Proposals
===========================

The 12th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing  
invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the  
main conference. The workshop program seeks to provide venues for  
specialist groups to meet, to generate focused discussion on specific  
sub-areas within Service Oriented Computing and to engage in  
community-building activities.
The workshops should provide a discussion forum for researchers in  
topics related to main theme of the conference, either on specific  
research themes or in emerging areas of research.

The workshops will be held on the 3rd of November in the same venue of  
the main conference.


IMPORTANT DATES

* Workshop Proposal Submission Deadline: 22th April 2014
* Workshop Acceptance Notification: 15th May 2014
* Camera Ready Paper & Copyright: 30th September 2014
* Workshops: 3rd November 2014

WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION

Workshop organizers will be responsible for the following:

* Constituting the workshop program committee
* Advertising the workshop
* Managing the paper review and selection process
* Ensuring that at least one author of each accepted paper attends to  
present the paper (this may require announcing regulations that  
stipulate this as a prerequisite for the publication of the paper in  
the workshop proceedings.)
* Ensuring that the workshop delivers useful scholarly/research value  
via active discussion/debate.
Workshops may be held for a full day or for half a day.
At least one author for each paper accepted to a workshop will need to  
register for the workshop programme.

WORKSHOPS PUBLICATION

It is likely that, as in previous years, the post-proceedings of the  
accepted workshops will be jointly published as a Springer volume. A  
formal proposal to Springer will only be made after the accepted  
workshops and their program committees are finalised. Workshops  
organisers can opt out of the volume should they wish to; a decision  
on this is required at workshop submission stage for planning purposes.
Working notes of the workshops (including papers to be eventually  
published in the joint workshop volume) will be printed locally for  
distribution on the workshop day.

WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS

Workshop proposal shall be submitted to workshop co-chairs at  
wc@icsoc.org and should include the following information:

* Workshop title
* Name, affiliation, postal and e-mail addresses of each (proposed)  
workshop chair
* A brief (1-page) CV of each (proposed) workshop chair, highlighting  
prior experience in organizing similar fora
* A brief description of the topic of the workshop and its relevance  
to the conference (not exceeding 500 words)
* Proposed duration of the workshop (full-day or half-day)
* A list of likely program committee members
* A description of the paper review and selection process (it is  
recommended that each paper is reviewed by 3 distinct members of the  
workshop program committee)
* An estimate of the number of submissions that will be attracted on  
the basis of workshops held in previous years or any other information.
* Plans for invited talks if any.
* A commitment as to whether or not the workshop organisers would like  
the post-proceedings to appear in Springer together with the other  
workshops.
* Any further information deemed relevant, e.g., previous workshops  
held on similar themes.

ICSOC-2014 WORKSHOP CHAIRS
* Daniela Grigori, University of Paris Dauphine, France
* Barbara Pernici, Politecnico di Milano, Italy
* Farouk Toumani, Blaise Pascal University, France
