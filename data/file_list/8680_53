The 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Information Systems for Ent=
erprises (IWAISE'14) explores trends in the development of advanced informa=
tion systems for enterprises and investigates various research issues of th=
is domain.=20

This 3rd edition especially focuses on trends and advances for information =
systems in relation with big data, cloud computing, agile development metho=
ds, and interoperability. We also welcome contributions on other research t=
opics and on industrial experiments related to the advancement of informati=
on systems. The list of suggested topics is presented below.=20

The engineering of information systems in organizations and companies becom=
es an emerging domain that encompasses multi-disciplinary topics, such as t=
he modeling of business processes and the development of enterprise ontolog=
ies and architectures. Furthermore, the field of information systems is cha=
nging fundamentally through the technologies of information and communicati=
on. The use of standards continues to transform rapidly how business activi=
ties are conducted around the world. This has led to a development of new m=
odels, new software systems, and a redefinition of the relations between co=
mpanies and processes.=20

This workshop aims to bring together researchers, developers and enterprise=
 communities to share their experiences and to discuss research issues in d=
eveloping and deploying advanced information systems for enterprises.=20

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:=20
- Big data and new information systems,=20
- Solutions to adapt information systems to big data,=20
- Information systems and cloud computing,=20
- Security and privacy in informations systems,=20
- Agile development methods for information systems,=20
- Semantic interoperability, ontology, semantic web,=20
- Interoperability of models, architectures and systems,=20
- Adaptation techniques in information systems,=20
- Pervasive information systems,=20
- Models, methods and tools for developing information systems,=20
- Specification and modeling languages for information systems,=20
- Information systems reengineering and integration,=20
- Collaboration and negotiation protocols,=20
- Verification techniques for information systems,=20
- Cooperative information systems,=20
- Applications and experience reports.=20

The language of the workshop is English. Submitted papers as well as presen=
tations during the workshop must be in English.=20

The program committee invites authors to submit full papers. Papers should =
clearly describe the nature of the work, explain its significance, highligh=
t its novel features, and state its current status. Authors of selected pap=
ers will be requested to prepare a manuscript for the workshop proceedings.=
