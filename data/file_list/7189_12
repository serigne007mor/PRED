Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: International Conference on Belief Functions,
 Compiegne,	France, 9-11 May 2012

[Sorry if you get multiple copies of this message]

==================================================
CALL FOR PAPERS

Second  International Conference on Belief functions Compiègne, France, 9-11 May 2012

http://www.hds.utc.fr/belief2012
==================================================

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn Shafer as a general framework for modeling epistemic uncertainty. These early contributions have been the starting points of many important developments, including the Transferable Belief Model and the Theory of Hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories.

The biennial BELIEF conferences are dedicated to the confrontation of ideas, the reporting of recent achievements and the presentation of the wide range of applications of this theory. This conference series was started in Brest, France, in 2010. The second edition will be held in Compiègne, France, on 9-11 May, 2012. Compiègne is located in the Picardy region, 75 km north of Paris and at 40mn from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
This conference will provide opportunities to exchange ideas and present new results on the theory of belief functions and related areas such as random sets and possibility theory. Original contributions are solicited on theoretical aspects (including decision making, combination rules, continuous belief functions, independence and graphical models, statistical estimation, etc.), as well as on applications in various areas including, but not limited to data fusion, pattern recognition, clustering, tracking, data mining, signal and image processing, medical diagnosis, business decision, uncertainty in numerical models, etc.

PUBLICATION
All accepted papers will be published in indexed conference proceedings (more details to be announced soon). Authors of selected papers from the BELIEF 2012 conference will be invited to submit an extended version of their papers for possible inclusion in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning.

PAPER SUBMISSION
Full papers are due by 1 December, 2011. All accepted papers will be presented either in single-track oral sessions, or in poster sessions.

TUTORIALS
Tutorials will be proposed on 9 May 2012. More details will be announced soon.

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission: 1 December, 2011
Notification of acceptance: 20 January, 2012
Final paper submission: 15 February, 2012
