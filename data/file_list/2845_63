The 3rd Special Session on High Performance Services Computing and Internet=
 Technologies (SerCo 2019)
http://hpcs2019.cisedu.info/2-conference/special-sessions/session05-serco

As part of The 17th International Conference on High Performance Computing =
& Simulation (HPCS 2019)
http://hpcs2019.cisedu.info/

July 15 =96 19, 2019
Dublin, Ireland


Best Papers of the Special Session will be Invited for Extended Submissions=
 to Top-Quality Journals


SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Since its establishment as a software design style, Service Oriented Archit=
ectures have taken the ICT world by storm. The Lego pieces logic thrived th=
rough Cloud Computing and it is now considered the standard approach in pra=
ctically every application framework. The keyword for this success is adapt=
ivity: Service Oriented Architectures are implemented through a wide range =
of technologies and tools leading to numerous combinations that meet the ap=
plication requirements in the desired way.

But there is a specific combination of application characteristics and requ=
irements that seemingly put SOAs to the test: data-intensive tasks coupled =
with performance and temporal requirements. The challenge is justified beca=
use SOAs are simply not meant to deal with shifting large data volumes betw=
een nodes. And unfortunately this is a common problem nowadays: IoT and big=
 data applications are simply two general application categories that come =
with exactly those characteristics and -more often than not- with the said =
temporal requirements. To a certain extent the problem is mitigated through=
 the increase of the SOA infrastructures=92 computing and storage node dens=
ity while =93stretching=94 them at the same time. Edge and fog computing as=
 well as lambda services are emerging trends that validate the concept.

This special session invites research communities from a diverse set of sci=
entific areas such as cloud, distributed, parallel and high-performance com=
puting to publish their work and share opinions about applications, challen=
ges and viable solutions to the potential new systems emerging from the nee=
d to deal with data intensive application tasks within a SOA and services c=
omputing framework.

The SerCo Session topics include (but are not limited to) the following:
The special session seeks works dealing with topics that revolve around the=
 general combination of SOA, data intensive applications and temporal requi=
rements. The technology space for this work may relate to the following not=
