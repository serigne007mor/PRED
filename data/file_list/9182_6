--- FOCUS ---

The traditional focus of the IDA symposium series is on end-to-end intellig=
ent
support for data analysis. In 2010, the series re-focused to support papers
that go beyond established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-
changing" ideas.

The symposium aims to provide a forum for inspiring research contributions
that might be considered preliminary in other leading conferences and journ=
als,
but that have a potentially dramatic impact. To facilitate this, IDA 2015 w=
ill
feature two tracks: a regular "Proceedings" track, as well as a "Horizon" t=
rack
for early-stage research of potentially ground-breaking nature. Submissions=
 to
this latter track will not be published in the proceedings, to allow authors
to present their most adventurous and controversial research ideas without
running the risk of compromising any subsequent publications.

The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to ERA, is open to all kinds=
 of
modeling and analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is expected to
be an interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that cut across
domains.

--- FRONTIER PRIZE ---

The IDA Frontier Prize will be awarded to the most visionary contribution.
Submissions considered for this award must present novel and surprising
approaches to data analysis. Last years' winners can be found on the IDA 20=
15
website. The award consists of a plaque and a prize of 1000 euros.

Both Proceedings and Horizon track submissions are eligible for the Frontier
prize.

--- KEYNOTE SPEAKERS ---

Along with the contributed presentations, the symposium schedule will featu=
re
three exciting keynote talks by renowned researchers, the details of which =
will
be announced in due course on our website:

http://www.ida2015.org/invited-speakers/

--- CALL FOR PAPERS ---

IDA solicits papers on all aspects of intelligent data analysis, including
papers on intelligent techniques to modeling and analyzing data from comple=
x,
dynamical systems. IDA 2015 particularly encourages innovative papers about:

  - Applications of IDA techniques to complex systems.
  - Concepts and principles for the analysis of complex, inter-linked, and =
heterogeneous data.
  - Human-computer interaction and cooperation for data analysis.
  - The interplay between data analysis and visualization.
  - Robustness and scalability issues of intelligent data analysis techniqu=
es.

The conventional reviewing process has a tendency to favor low risk increme=
ntal
contributions over inspiring high risk contributions. This can discourage t=
he kind
of papers that IDA hopes to publish. For this reason, similar to IDA 2014, =
IDA 2015
will have two paper tracks, the combination of which addresses this issue.

A] Proceedings Track

Papers submitted to this track will be reviewed and, if accepted, published=
 in the
proceedings. Submitted papers should consist of at most 11 pages in LNCS fo=
rmat.
Papers may be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.

To ensure that the papers sought by IDA get accepted, referees will evaluate
papers against the stated goals of the symposium, and if at least one progr=
am
chair advisor writes an informed, thoughtful, positive review for a paper, =
this
may outweigh non-substantial or subjective criticisms of other reviewers.

We strongly encourage all authors to upload their Proceedings track submiss=
ion onto
a preprint server such as arxiv, prior to submission. After acceptance uplo=
ading
your paper onto a preprint server will no longer be optional but mandatory,=
 and we
will require all authors to do this by the camera-ready deadline.

Following IDA's tradition, the proceedings of IDA 2015 will be published as=
 a
volume in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

B] Horizon Track

The Horizon track, which is a fine-tuned version of last year's First Look =
track,
aims to provide a forum for potentially ground-breaking research that is ho=
wever
not yet mature enough for archival dissemination. You may have a great idea=
 that
needs to be investigated in more detail, or you may have a long-term vision=
 that
you would like to share. In these cases, it may be impossible or undesirabl=
e to
publish a preliminary version of your paper in the proceedings, but present=
ing
and discussing it at IDA may be of interest to both you and the community.

To be considered for a Horizon Track presentation, you are required to subm=
it a
title and a short abstract (<250 words) and optionally any other material (=
e.g.
an extended abstract, a partial manuscript, a presentation, a movie, a webs=
ite=E2=80=A6)
that may help us to review the submission against the stated criteria. Titl=
es and
abstracts of contributions accepted for the Horizon track will be listed on=
 the
website and included in the proceedings front matter, but any other materia=
l submitted
will be used for reviewing only, and will not be publicly divulged in any f=
orm.
Horizon Track contributions may be accepted for either oral or poster prese=
ntation.
