It is a great pleasure to announce an international workshop on the
theme of representation of terms and definitions of concepts in verbal
as well as nonverbal forms. The ISO standard 704 "Terminology work =96
principles and methods" mentions three types of designation =96 terms,
appellations and symbols. The last of these constitute an important
aid in international communication by transferring the information
directly. The ISO standard 10241-1 =93Terminological entries =96 General
requirements and examples of presentation=94 explicitly mentions the
nonverbal representations used instead of definitions. An illustration
is sometimes more explicit than a language definition.

Verbal and nonverbal representations of concepts show up in a number
of terminologies of scientific and technical disciplines. This is
especially the case for the activities at the The Danish National
Research Foundation=92s Centre for Textile Research which show that
verbal and nonverbal representations have been used for several
millennia. In the field of weaving, in particular, weaving
representations for basic and derived weaves are configured in
diagrams and logograms, thus collapsing designation and definition. A
good example of this phenomenon is the basic weave =94tabby=94 which can
be designated by figures, codes and terms.

We welcome presentations about theoretical and applied aspects of
verbal and nonverbal representations in terminology.

The TOTh workshop will begin with a presentation of the work of the
The Danish National Research Foundation=92s Centre for Textile Research
about the verbal and nonverbal configurations in the field of
textiles, and a presentation on the concept of design as a theoretical
framework by the University of Southern Denmark, SDU.
