=======================================================
CDUD 2022

Special Session on Concept Discovery in Unstructured Data
at the 14th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database 
Systems (ACIIDS 2022)
Almaty, Kazakhstan, June 6-9, 2022
Conference website: http://www.aciids.pwr.edu.pl/
=======================================================

Objectives and topics

Concept discovery is a subdomain of Knowledge Discovery (KDD) and AI 
that uses human-centered techniques such as Formal Concept Analysis 
(FCA), Topic Modeling, Visual Text Representations, Conceptual Graphs 
etc. for gaining insight into the underlying conceptual structure of the 
data. Traditional machine learning techniques are mainly focusing on 
structured data whereas most data available resides in unstructured, 
often textual, form. Compared to traditional data mining techniques, 
human-centered instruments actively engage the domain expert in the 
discovery process.

This special session welcomes papers describing innovative research on 
data discovery techniques. Moreover, this workshop intends to provide a 
forum for researchers and developers of data mining instruments, working 
on issues associated with analyzing unstructured data. First, we are 
interested in methods for transforming unstructured into semi-structured 
information. Unstructured information such as texts or images can be 
tagged, keywords can be extracted from texts by means of Natural 
Language Processing methods, etc. For example, recently so-called 
Learning Representations such as Text Vectors or Visual Words have 
gained much attention in the domain of unstructured data. Second, in 
this workshop we also particularly welcome research on using 
human-centered instruments such as FCA to analyze unstructured and 
semi-structured data. Applications in which we are interested include 
but are not limited to Text Mining and Web Mining including forums, 
blogs, social sharing systems like Twitter and Facebook, mining 
sociological interviews, etc. We are also interested in innovative 
instruments for dealing with interpretability, fairness, transparency, 
knowledge incompleteness and asymmetry. CDUD 2022 is the fourth edition 
of the three preceding workshops: CDUD 2016 (Moscow, Russia, 2016; 
website: https://cla2016.hse.ru/cdud; Proceedings: 
http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1625/), CDUD 2012 (​​Leuven, Belgium, 2012; 
Proceedings: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-871/), and CDUD 2011 (Moscow, 
Russia, 2011; Proceedings: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-757/).

The scope of the CDUD 2022 includes (but not limited) the following topics:
- Applications of FCA for discovery purposes
- Association Rules and Frequent Closed Itemsets
- Biclustering and Multimodal clustering
- Conceptual Clustering
- Dealing with knowledge incompleteness and asymmetry
- Deep Learning for Text Representations
- Discovery techniques for conceptual models
- Explainable, fair and transparent AI
- Efficient indexing and structuring algorithms
- Formal Concept Analysis and Rough Sets
- Graph Mining and Learning
- Pattern Mining for Intelligent Transport
- Knowledge discovery and representation
- Natural Language Processing
- Ontology Learning from text
- Probabilistic concept discovery
- Patterns in Big Data and No-SQL databases
- Recommender Systems
- Text Mining and Text Kernels
- Topic Modeling
- Visual Analytics

Submission Details

All contributions should be original and not published elsewhere or 
intended to be published during the review period. Authors are invited 
to submit their papers electronically in pdf format, through EasyChair. 
All the special sessions are centralized as tracks in the same 
conference management system as the regular papers. Therefore, to submit 
a paper please activate the following link and select the track: CDUD 
2022: Special Session on Concept Discovery in Unstructured Data.

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aciids2022

Authors are invited to submit original previously unpublished research 
papers written in English, of up to 13 pages, strictly following the 
LNCS/LNAI format guidelines. Authors can download the Latex 
(recommended) or Word templates available at Springer's web site. 
Submissions not following the format guidelines will be rejected without 
review. To ensure high quality, all papers will be thoroughly reviewed 
by the CDUD 2022 Program Committee. All accepted papers must be 
presented by one of the authors who must register for the conference and 
pay the fee. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in 
the prestigious series LNCS/LNAI (indexed by ISI CPCI-S, included in ISI 
Web of Science, EI, ACM Digital Library, dblp, Google Scholar, Scopus, 
etc.).
