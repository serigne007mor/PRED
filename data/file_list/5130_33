The objective of the ADBIS series of conferences is to provide a forum 
for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote 
interaction and collaboration between the database and information 
systems research communities from European countries and the rest of the 
world. The ADBIS conferences provide an international platform for the 
presentation of research on database theory, development of advanced 
DBMS technologies and their advanced applications.

ADBIS 2021 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions 
reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as 
of invited talks presented by leading scientists.

ADBIS welcomes papers in the following topics (non-exclusive list):
- Data-intensive sciences and databases
- Theoretical foundations of databases
- Management of large-scale data systems
- Data models and query languages
- Data curation, annotation, and provenance
- Data warehousing, OLAP, and ETL tools
- Indexing, query processing and optimization
- Data mining and knowledge discovery
- Big data storage, replication, and consistency
- Modelling, mining and querying user-generated content
- Web, XML and semi-structured databases
- Data and information-intensive services
- Data quality and data cleansing
- Artificial intelligence in databases and information systems
- Sensor databases and mobile data management
- Text databases and information retrieval
- Probabilistic databases, uncertainty and approximate querying
- Temporal and spatial databases
- Graph databases
- Databases on emerging hardware architectures
- Distributed data platforms, including Cloud data systems, key-value 
stores, and Big Data systems
- Distributed ledger technologies
- Information extraction and integration
- Streaming data analysis
- Scalable data analysis and analytics
- Data and information visualization; and user interfaces
