CALL FOR PAPERS: Information Systems Special Issue on Cloud Intelligence
************************************************************************

http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/cloud-i/?page_id=3D243


With the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud business intelligence=
 "as a service" offerings have arisen, both from cloud startups and major B=
I industry vendors. Beyond porting BI features into the cloud, which alread=
y implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL database modeling and storag=
e, data localization, data marketplaces, security and privacy, performance,=
 cost and usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges f=
or making data analytics available to small and medium-size enterprises (SM=
Es), non-governmental organizations, web communities (e.g., supported by so=
cial networks), and even the average citizen. This vision requires new inte=
gration and deployment models. For example, some deployments would benefit =
from an integrated database of private and open data.=20


Following the 2nd edition of the Cloud-I workshop at VLDB 2013 (http://eric=
.univ-lyon2.fr/cloud-i/), the aim of this special issue of Information Syst=
ems is to attract the best papers related to the field of Cloud Intelligenc=
e, with respect to the non-exhaustive list of topics below. Survey papers o=
n specific topics within Cloud Intelligence are also welcome.
