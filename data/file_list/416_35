CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on the Theory on Belief Functions

Brest, France, April 1-2, 2010

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or=20
Dempster-Shafer theory, was first introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in=20
the context of statistical inference, and was later developed by Glenn=20
Shafer as a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty. These=20
early contributions have been the starting points of many important=20
developments, including the Transferable Belief Model and the Theory of=20
Hints. The theory of belief functions is now well established as a=20
general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, and has well=20
understood connections to other frameworks such as probability,=20
possibility and imprecise probability theories.

This workshop is dedicated to the confrontation of ideas, the reporting=20
of recent achievements and the presentation of the wide range of=20
applications of this theory.

AUDIENCE AND TOPICS OF INTEREST
This workshop will give opportunities to exchange information and ideas=20
on various aspects of the theory of belief functions. The intended=20
audience for this workshop includes researchers and practitioners=20
develop and use the theory of belief functions. Original contributions=20
are therefore solicited on theoretical aspects (including decision=20
making, combination rules, continuous belief functions, independence and=20
graphical models, statistical estimation, etc), as well as on=20
applications in various areas including, but not limited to data fusion,=20
pattern recognition, clustering, tracking, data mining, signal and image=20
processing, medical diagnosis, business decision, etc.

PUBLICATION
Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication=20
in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning=20
(Elsevier).

PAPER SUBMISSION
Paper submissions are due by 1 December 2009 and should be no more than=20
6 pages in length. Paper submission instructions are available at=20
www.ensieta.fr/belief2010. All submitted papers will be reviewed by a=20
double-blind (at least two reviewers).

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission: December 1, 2009
Notification of acceptance: January 15, 2010
Final paper submission: February 15, 2010
