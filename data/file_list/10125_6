Subject: [liste-egc] SITIS'12 CFP: The 8th Int. Conf. on SIGNAL IMAGE
 TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS, Sorrento-Italy

		                       CALL FOR PAPERS
========================================================================================================
			Internet-Based Computing and Systems (IBCS) track at

SITIS 2012 - The 8th International Conference on SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS
				In cooperation with  
		IEEE Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing (pending)
			November 25-29, 2012, Sorrento - Naples, Italy

				http://sitis.u-bourgogne.fr/12/
========================================================================================================

The SITIS conference is dedicated to research on the technologies used to represent, share and 
process information in various forms, ranging from signal, image, and multimedia data to traditional 
structured data and semi structured data found in the web.  

The focus of the track on Internet Based Systems and Computing is on emerging and novel concepts, 
architectures and methodologies for information management. 
Novel architectures are being proposed to allow resource sharing and distributed processing of data with increasing complexity. 
Cloud computing, peer to peer computing, mobile information systems, semantic based applications, 
and decision support systems are a few examples of these applications and systems. 

The Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

Data semantics
* Multiple Representation
* Ontologies
* Conceptual Data Modeling
* Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
* Metadata
* Evolution and Change
