Important dates:
----------------
* Early Paper Submission: 8 May, 2012
* Early Notification:     24 June, 2012
* Final Paper Submission: 24 July, 2012
* Final Notification:     8 September, 2012
* Camera Ready:           24 September, 2012
* Conference:             4-6 November, 2012

The 4th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML2012) will be held on
November 4-6, 2012, at the Singapore Management University, Singapore. The
conference aims at providing a leading international forum for researchers
in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas and
achievements. Submissions from other than the Asia-Pacific regions are also
highly encouraged.

The conference program consists of tutorials, workshops, invited keynote
talks by distinguished researchers as well as single track sessions of
research paper presentations. The invited keynote speakers for ACML 2012
are James Rehg (Georgia Tech), Dale Schuurmans (University of Alberta), and
Bob Williamson (Australian National University and NICTA).

The proceedings will be published as a volume of Journal of Machine
Learning Research (JMLR): Workshop and Conference Proceedings. Authors of
selected papers will be invited to submit a significantly extended version
of their paper to a post-conference special issue of the Machine Learning
journal. The BEST STUDENT PAPER will receive an award sponsored by the
Machine Learning journal.

This year ACML will have an innovative new feature: TWO submission
deadlines. The late deadline has the usual =93accept=94 or =93reject=94 out=
comes.
In addition to the two outcomes, the early deadline also has "conditional
accept subject to required revisions", and =93resubmit=94 with notification=
 in
time for them to make the final deadline. The submission of "conditional
accept" decision is strongly encouraged to carefully address the review
comments in their revision. The revision without addressing the review
comments properly might be rejected. The submission of "resubmit" decision
must be significantly improved and revised before it can be re-submitted in
the late deadline. Fresh submissions that have not caught up with the early
deadline are also welcome for the late deadline.


ACML2012 calls for papers that report high quality original research
results on machine learning and related fields. The topics include but are
not limited to the following:

1. Learning problems

* Active learning
* Cost-sensitive Learning
* Ensemble methods
* Feature selection/extraction/construction
* Incremental learning and on-line learning
* Learning in graphs and networks
* Multi-agent learning
* Multi-instance learning
* Reinforcement learning
* Semi-supervised learning
* Supervised learning
* Classification, regression, ranking, structured, logical
* Transfer and multi-task learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Clustering, deep learning, latent variable models
* Other learning problems

2. Analysis of learning systems

* Computational learning theory
* Experimental evaluation methodology
* Others

3. Applications

* Bioinformatics
* Collaborative filtering
* Computer vision
* Information retrieval
* Mobile and pervasive computing
* Natural language processing
* Social networks
* Web search
* Other applications

4. Learning in knowledge-intensive systems

* Knowledge refinement and theory revision
* Multi-strategy learning
* Other systems

5. Other learning problems

Abstract and Paper Submission:
------------------------------
Electronic abstract and paper should be submitted through the ACML 2012
submission site:
https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ACML2012/

Papers should be written in English and formatted according to the JMLR
Workshop and Conference Proceedings format (
http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/). The maximum length of papers is 16
pages in this format. Overlength submissions or submissions without
appropriate format will be rejected without review. Paper submissions
should ensure double-blind reviews. Please be sure to remove any
information from your submission that can identify the authors, including
author names, affiliations, self citations and any acknowledgments.

Proceedings will be published as a volume of JMLR: Workshop and Conference
Proceedings (this is not equivalent to a regular issue of JMLR) at
http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/

Papers submitted to this conference must not have been published, accepted
for publication or be under review for another conference or journal.
Novelty is an important criterion in the selection of papers.

To encourage interdisciplinary contributions, ACML will welcome papers that
address applications of machine learning in other areas.
For these application papers, the novelty will be judged based on the
applications of machine learning methods. These papers will be evaluated
differently for the algorithmic papers. Authors of these papers should
choose "Applications" as the primary topic.

Submitting a paper to ACML 2012 means that if the paper is accepted, at
least one author will attend the conference to present the paper. All
papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format only, before the
deadline through the submission system. More information, including
detailed author instruction, is available at:
http://acml12.comp.nus.edu.sg/index.php?n=3DMain.CallForPapers
