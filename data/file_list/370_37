JUNE 16-20, 2008, Montpellier, FRANCE

Papers submission deadline: November 30, 2007
http://www.lirmm.fr/caise08/


SCOPE AND TOPICS:

The CAISE Conference is celebrating its 20th birthday! After these 20=20
years, Information Systems (IS) now support and underlie most, if not all,=
=20
of our human activities. Considering the major economic and social=20
development challenges now at stake, it is time to enter into the era of=20
Sustainable Information Systems (SIS). As our world of interdependent=20
activities and information technology continues to undergo profound changes=
=20
and transformations, it is fundamental to maintain an adequate balance=20
between activities and systems, and to promote their evolution in the=20
context of sustainability.

CAiSE=9208 aims to bring together practitioners and researchers in the fiel=
d=20
of information systems engineering. CAiSE=9208 invites submissions on the=
=20
development, evolution, requirements and usage of information systems. This=
=20
year=92s special theme is "Sustainable Information Systems" (SIS) which are=
=20
information systems with built-in support to handle evolution. Information=
=20
systems are growing rapidly in scale and complexity. At the same time,=20
information system evolution is a fact of life in today=92s organizations.=
=20
Furthermore, nomadism and mobile communication lead to a process of=20
continuous change of services provided by information systems. SIS should=
=20
continuously simplify adequacy between system and enterprise requirements=
=20
as well as assimilation of new supporting technologies. In addition,=20
approaches for SIS should reduce the failure rate in IS development and=20
allow for the definition of quality & maturity of IS development. An SIS=20
must meet the needs of the present without compromising its ability to meet=
=20
future requirements related to its context of use, and, consequently, must=
=20
enable and facilitate innovative policies and practices at the activity lev=
el.

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:
=B7 IS development for sustainability IS
=B7 IS development with ubiquitous technologies
=B7 IT requirements for SIS development
=B7 Cognitive, business, social and requirement models for SIS
=B7 Secure & trusted SIS
=B7 IS compliance with rules, regulations or laws
=B7 IS evolution at any level: goals, requirements, models, systems Databas=

=B7 Adequacy of IS development and enterprise development
=B7 Networked & virtual organizations
=B7 Participatory, collaborative IS approaches

The conference also welcomes papers on the fundamental aspects of IS=20
engineering.
=B7 Enterprise architecture and enterprise modelling
=B7 Requirements engineering for IS
=B7 Knowledge patterns relevant to IS engineering (ISE)
=B7 Ontology for ISE
=B7 Business process modelling and management

IMPORTANT DATES:

Tutorials & Workshops submission deadline: October 14, 2007
Papers submission deadline:                     NOVEMBER 30, 2007
Notification of acceptance:                     February 15, 2008
CAISE 2008 Conference & Workshops:      June 16-20, 2008


TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS:

We invite four types of original and scientific papers:
o Formal and/or technical papers describe original research contributions=
=20
(theoretical, methodological or conceptual) to the field of IS engineering.=
=20
A research paper should clearly describe the situation or problem tackled,=
=20
the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and the=
=20
potential - or, even better, the evaluated - benefits of the contribution.

o Evaluation papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate=20
proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e. by empirical studies,=20
experiments, case studies, simulations, formal analyses, mathematical=20
proofs, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in industry=20
also falls into this category. The topic of the evaluation presented in the=
=20
paper as well as its causal or logical properties must be clearly stated.=
=20
The research method must be sound and appropriate.

o Experience papers present problems or challenges encountered in practice,=
=20
relate success and failure stories, or report on industrial practice. The=
=20
focus is on 'what' and on lessons learned, not on an in-depth analysis of=
=20
'why'. The practice must be clearly described and its context must be=20
given. Readers should be able to draw conclusions for their own practice.

o Exploratory Papers can describe completely new research positions or=20
approaches, in order to face to a generic situation arising because of new=
=20
IT tools or new kinds of activities or new IS challenges, in particular=20
relevant to sustainable IS. They must describe precisely the situation and=
=20
demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways of reasoning, meta-models=85 a=
re=20
inadequate. They must rigorously present their approach and demonstrate its=
=20
pertinence and correctness to addressing the identified situation.
SUBMISSION CONDITIONS:

Papers should be submitted in PDF format. The results described must be=20
unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere. Submissions must=20
conform to Springer's LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages, including=
=20
all text, figures, references and appendices. Submissions not conforming to=
=20
the LNCS format or exceeding 15 pages will be rejected without review.=20
Information about the Springer LNCS format can be found at=20
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. Three to five keywords=20
characterising the paper should be indicated at the end of the abstract.


REVIEW PROCESS AND PUBLICATION:

At least three members of the CAiSE=9208 program committee will review each=
=20
submission. The program committee will meet to review and make final=20
decisions. Accepted papers will be presented at CAiSE=9208 and published in=
=20
the conference proceedings.

The conference proceedings will be published in Springer Lecture Notes in=
=20
Computer Science (LNCS).

<br>
</b>The CAISE Conference is celebrating its 20th birthday! After these 20

Sustainable Information Systems (SIS). As our world of interdependent

CAiSE=9208 aims to bring together practitioners and researchers in the
field of information systems engineering. CAiSE=9208 invites submissions on
the development, evolution, requirements and usage of information
systems. This year=92s special theme is &quot;Sustainable Information
Systems&quot; (SIS) which are information systems with built-in support
to handle evolution. Information systems are growing rapidly in scale and
complexity. At the same time, information system evolution is a fact of
life in today=92s organizations. Furthermore, nomadism and mobile
communication lead to a process of continuous change of services provided
by information systems. SIS should continuously simplify adequacy between
system and enterprise requirements as well as assimilation of new

the failure rate in IS development and allow for the definition of
quality &amp; maturity of IS development. An SIS must meet the needs of
the present without compromising its ability to meet future requirements

evaluation presented in the paper as well as its causal or logical
properties must be clearly stated. The research method must be sound and
appropriate.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Courier New, Courier">
<dd>o </font><b>Experience papers</b> present problems or challenges
encountered in practice, relate success and failure stories, or report on
industrial practice. The focus is on 'what' and on lessons learned, not
on an in-depth analysis of 'why'. The practice must be clearly described
and its context must be given. Readers should be able to draw conclusions
for their own practice. <br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Courier New, Courier">
<dd>o </font><b>Exploratory Papers </b>can describe completely new
research positions or approaches, in order to face to a generic situation
arising because of new IT tools or new kinds of activities or new IS
challenges, in particular relevant to sustainable IS. They must describe
precisely the situation and demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways
of reasoning, meta-models=85 are inadequate. They must rigorously present
their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness to
addressing the identified situation.<b>=20
