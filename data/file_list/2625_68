Recommender Systems for Opening Opinion Bubbles and Echo Chambers : =
Application to Political News

Duration : 3 years

Starting date : October. 1st 2021

Motivation and Context
The issue of information diversity is crucial for healthy democratic =
debates and has arisen recently due to the increasing use of social =
media as a source of information [1]. The use of these platforms has =
raised concerns because information diffusion does not follow the usual =
editorial process (information checking, editorial decision), but is in =
part processed by recommendation systems (RS) [2] that provide users =
with information mainly aligned with their initial opinions. Doing so, =
RS might enclose users in an opinion bubble [3, 4]. Likewise, platforms =
without RS allowing users to share and offer their own content can lock =
them into echo chambers (some people tend to only read resources that =
con=EF=AC=81rm or reinforce their initial positions).

In a political information context, opinion bubbles and echo chambers =
can cause polarization. This process leads users to move toward more =
extreme political viewpoints and actions than those to which they were =
originally inclined. It can be detrimental to democracy and carry on =
actions which may cause public troubles [3].

The project this PhD thesis is part of aims to analyse and model opinion =
bubbles and echo chambers over time and proposes innovative algorithms =
to open them. The project builds on a multidisciplinary expertise in =
political science, digital economics, media studies, content analysis =
and recommender systems.

Objectives
Within this project, the PhD thesis is dedicated to designing algorithms =
to open opinion bubbles, mainly through a recommender system. Such a RS =
has to provide news in line with users=E2=80=99 topics of interest, with =
a gradual broader spectrum of political opinions. The target is not a =
total change of users=E2=80=99 opinions but a greater awareness of other =
opinions or viewpoints, to contribute to a healthy democratic debate.

The main steps in this PhD thesis are to : =E2=80=93 De=EF=AC=81ne user =
pro=EF=AC=81les : what features have to be considered in the pro=EF=AC=81l=
e to provide with recommendations. This step will be strongly related to =
the news content analysis performed by another PhD student ;
=E2=80=93 Design an algorithm to identify and model =EF=AC=81lter =
bubbles
=E2=80=93 Design a temporal and diversity-oriented RS. The diversity =
will have to be rede=EF=AC=81ned for the domain of news and opinion =
awareness. One challenge will be to be to consider users=E2=80=99 =
feedback about recommendations.
=E2=80=93 Design an explanation module. To increase the adoption of the =
recommender system by the users, the recommendations have to be =
explained, especially as the recommendations are not fully in line with =
the users opinion.

Candidates Pro=EF=AC=81le
The successful candidate has knowledge and experience in machine =
learning, recommender systems, user modeling, data science and an =
inclination for human-oriented problems.

Fluency in French language is not compulsory but recommended in order to =
be able to understand the resources shared during the experiments and =
the political context of the country.

Application

The required documents for applying are the following :
=E2=80=93 resume ;
=E2=80=93 a motivation letter ;
=E2=80=93 your degree certi=EF=AC=81cates and transcripts for Bachelor =
and Master ;
=E2=80=93 master thesis if it is already completed, or a description of =
the work in progress, otherwise ;
=E2=80=93 all your publications, if any ;
=E2=80=93 at least one recommendation letter from the person who =
supervises(d) your Master thesis (or research project or internship).
