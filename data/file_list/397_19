 1st Call for Papers: KDBI 2009-Knowledge Discovery and Business 
Intelligence
 a thematic track of EPIA 2009, the 14th Portuguese Conference on 
Artificial Intelligence
 Aveiro, Portugal, October 12-15, 2009

 http://epia2009.web.ua.pt/kdbi
 
 >> Deadline for paper submission: April 15, 2009 <<
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence

The aim of this thematic track is to gather the latest research in 
Knowledge Discovery (KD) and Business Intelligence (BI). We encourage 
papers that deal with the interaction with the end users, taking into 
account how easily one can understand data model's representation of 
extracted knowledge or encode expert knowledge, as well as its impact on 
real organizations. In particular, papers that describe experience and 
lessons learned from KD/BI projects and/or present business and 
organizational impacts using AI technologies, are welcome.

The amount of data representing the activities of organizations that is 
stored in databases is exponentially growing. Moreover, business 
organizations are increasingly moving towards decision-making processes 
that are based on information. Thus, pressure to extract as much useful 
information as possible from these data is very strong. Knowledge 
Discovery (KD) is a branch of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field 
that aims to extract useful and understandable high-level knowledge from 
complex and/or large volumes of data. Business Intelligence (BI) is an 
umbrella term that represents computer architectures, tools, 
technologies and methods to enhance managerial decision making in public 
and corporate enterprises, from operational to strategic level.

KD and Data Mining (DM) are faced with new challenges. The temporal and 
spatial nature of the data generation demands new learning approaches, 
since samples' observations are no longer independent and the underlying 
regularities may change over time. New challenges are also to be 
considered when integrating background knowledge into the learning 
processes. Indeed, the success of hybrid models for knowledge 
understanding and the dead-end of several purely experimental methods in 
machine learning and DM are pointing to a more rationalistic view. In 
this context, the understanding of data and human mind emerges as 
crucial in combining KD with Cognitive Models. Namely, results in 
inductive logic or in neuro-symbolic methods seem to show the need of 
more knowledge aware models. Moreover, AI plays a crucial role in BI, 
providing methodologies to deal with prediction, optimization and 
adaptability to dynamic environments, in an attempt to offer support to 
better (more informed) decisions. In effect, several AI techniques can 
be used to address these problems, namely KD/DM, Evolutionary 
Computation and Modern Optimization, Forecasting, Neural Computing and 
Intelligent Agents.

Paper submission

All submissions will be refereed and selected for presentation at the 
conference on the basis of quality and relevance to the KDBI issues. A 
selection of high quality full papers presented in the different tracks 
will appear in a book published by Springer, in the LNAI series. All 
remaining papers presented at the conference will be published in a 
conference proceedings book.

Submitted papers can be full-length papers or short papers. Full papers 
can have a maximum length of 12 pages. Short papers can have a maximum 
length of 4 pages. All papers should be prepared according to the 
formatting instructions of Springer LNAI series 
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0). Authors 
should omit their names from the submitted papers, and should take 
reasonable care to avoid indirectly disclosing their identity.

All papers should be submitted in PDF format through the conference 
management website at: https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/EPIA2009
