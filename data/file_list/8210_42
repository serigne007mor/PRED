PHD POSITION IN COMPUTING SCIENCE : AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND NATURAL LANGUA=
GE PROCESSING AT GRENOBLE LIG-LAB (France) AND UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN (Scot=
land)
------



TOPIC
-----------------------

This project will investigate the potential for computers to summarize ambi=
ent personal information through automatically generated narratives. The  w=
ork focuses on data continuously collected through smart phones. The propos=
ition involves three main scientific tasks: abstraction of smart-phone data=
 (Data processing), organisation of the content in the form of a story (Com=
putational narratology), expression of this story in natural language (Natu=
ral Language Generation).

CONTEXT
-----------------------

This thesis will take place within the context of a collaboration between t=
he University of Aberdeen and the Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble. B=
oth institution will be involved in the supervision of the thesis and the c=
andidate will visit the two sites regularly.


APPLICATION DETAILS
----------------------------------
The research is expected to be funded by the DGA/DSTL funding scheme. If yo=
u are interested in this funding, please send the following information to =
francois.portet@imag.fr, catherine.garbay@imag.fr and ehud.reiter@abdn.ac.u=
k :
- a letter of motivation,
- a detailed Resume,
- a copy of all diplomas after high school and
- the detailed list of all the marks obtained in the Master and Bachelor
 degrees.


REQUIREMENTS & ELIGIBILITY
------------------------------------------
Due to the funding scheme, only French or British Nationals can apply. The =
high-standard successful candidate will possess a Master degree covering pr=
imarily the field of Artificial Intelligence or Natural Language Processing=
. Additional skills that would be appreciated are Semantic web, Signal Proc=
essing or Computation Creativity. Autonomy and openness are also required.


Closing date for applications: 1st April 2013
