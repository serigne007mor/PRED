==== Call for papers  PMDB 2022 workshop @ DASFAA 2022 =======

** 1st Workshop on Pattern mining and Machine learning in Big complex
Databases @ DASFAA 2022 **
in conjunction with DASFAA 2022
11th April 2022, virtual conference

Scope
=====

In the last decades, more and more data is being stored in databases. To
understand the past and perform prediction from this data, machine learning
has become a key research area, with highly effective techniques and models
such as deep learning, clustering, reinforcement learning, regression and
anomaly detection. But many machine learning techniques operate as black
boxes. Hence, an alternative to traditional machine learning that is being
studied is pattern mining. It aims at developing algorithms to find
patterns in data that meet a set of user-defined constraints. Pattern
mining algorithms may not be as effective as traditional machine learning
for prediction tasks but can uncover patterns that are easily interpretable.

Although, machine learning and pattern mining have been studied for many
years, and have many applications, a key issue is that most studies focus
on processing simple data types such as relational data and do not consider
other important aspects such as the time dimension. With the emergence of
new applications such as the internet of things, vehicular networks, sensor
networks and multimedia applications, it has become crucial to process
complex data. This encompasses various complex data types such as temporal
data, streaming data, spatial data, multimedia data, text data,
heterogeneous data, and graph data. Adapting existing machine learning and
pattern mining models to process complex data requires to solve many hard
challenges such as how to store and access the data efficiently, and how to
deal with concept drifts, incremental updates, and how to merge multiple
views and models built from data. Besides, another important problem that
must be dealt with is how to scale current machine learning and pattern
mining techniques to handle big complex data.

The 1st Workshop on Pattern mining and Machine learning in Big complex
Databases (PMDB 2022) aims at providing a place for researchers from the
fields of machine learning, pattern mining and database to present and
exchange ideas about how to adapt and develop techniques to process and
analyze big complex data.

The scope of PMDB 2022 encompasses many topics that revolves around
database technology, machine learning, data mining and pattern mining.
These topics include but are not limited to:

- Artificial intelligence, machine learning and pattern mining models for
analyzing big complex data
- Database engines for storing and querying big complex data
- Distributed database systems
- Data models and query languages
- Distributed and parallel algorithms
- Real-time processing of big data
- Nature-inspired and metaheuristic algorithms
- Multimedia data, spatial data, biomedical data, and text
- Unstructured, semi-structured and heterogeneous data
- Temporal data and streaming data
- Graph data and multi-view data
- Uncertain, fuzzy and approximate data
- Visualization and evaluation of big complex data
- Predictive models for big complex data
- Privacy-preservation and security issues for big complex data
- Explainable models for big complex data
- Interactive data analysis
- Open-source software and platforms
- Applications in domains such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, sport
and social media
