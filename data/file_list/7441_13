"Rights and Duties of Autonomous Agents''
Workshop at ECAI 2012

August 27 or 28, 2012

Montpellier, France

https://rda2-2012.greyc.fr/

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The autonomous decision capability embedded in software or robot agents is =
one of the major issues of Artificial Intelligence. It is a core property f=
or AI applications such as e-commerce, serious games, ambient computing, so=
cial or collective robotics, companion robots, unmanned vehicles.

Autonomous agents decide and act in a given context or environment and unde=
r domain constraints, and possibly interact with other agents or human bein=
gs e.g. to share tasks or to execute tasks on behalf of others. It is thus =
important to define regulation and control mechanisms to ensure sound and c=
onsistent behaviours both at the agent=92s individual level and at the mult=
i-agent level. Organisation models, conversation policies, normative system=
s, constraints, logical frameworks address the problem of how agents=92 aut=
onomous behaviours should be controlled, paving the way for formal or pragm=
atic definitions of agents=92 Rights and Duties. The issue is all the more =
important as autonomous agents may encounter new situations, evolve in open=
 environments, interact with agents based on different design principles, a=
ct on behalf of human beings and share common resources. For instance: shou=
ld an autonomous agent take over the control from a human operator? under w=
hich circumstances?

The aim of this workshop is to promote discussions and exchanges on the dif=
ferent issues raised by autonomous agents=92 Rights and Duties and models t=
hat can be proposed to represent and reason on Rights and Duties.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

We encourage contributions from the following research and application area=
s:
=95 Autonomous agents and privacy protection
=95 Rights and duties for learning agents
=95 Authority sharing between autonomous agents and human users or operators
=95 Rights and duties of autonomous agents towards other agents; towards hu=
man users or operators
=95 Rights and duties of human users or operators towards autonomous agents=
 (especially robots)
=95 Consistency, conflicts among rights and duties in multi-agent and human=
/agent systems
=95 Mutual intelligibility, explanations
=95 Rights and duties vs failures
=95 Rights and duties of autonomous agents and ethical issues
=95 Control of autonomous agents within organisations, institutions, normat=
ive systems
=95 Sociology and law in the modelling of rights and duties: authority, pow=
er, dependence, penalty, contracts
=95 Trust and reputation for autonomous agents regulation
=95 Emergence and evolution of rights and duties
=95 Knowledge representation and models for rights and duties
=95 Reasoning on rights and duties
=95 Validation of rights and duties in autonomous agents
