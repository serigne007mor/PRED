Information Systems are record sensitive and crucial data to support day-to=
-day
company applications and decision making processes. Therefore, these systems
often contain most of company product and process knowledge. Unfortunately,
this knowledge is implicitly encoded within the semantics of the modelling
languages used by the companies. The explicit semantics is usually not reco=
rded
in such models of information systems. References to ontologies could be
considered as an added value for handling the explicit semantics carried by=
 the
concepts, data and instances of models Thus, developing new user Interfaces=
 or
reconciling data and/or models with external ones often require some kind of
reverse engineering processes for making data semantic explicit.
Nowadays, ontologies are used for making explicit the meaning of informatio=
n in
several research and application domains. Ontologies are now used in a large
spectrum of fields such as: Semantic Web, information integration, database
design, e-Business, data warehousing, data mining, system interoperability,
formal verification. They are also used to provide information system user
knowledge-level interfaces. Over the last five year, a number of interactio=
ns
between ontologies and information systems have emerged. New methods have b=
een
proposed to embed within database both ontologies and data, defining new
ontology-based database. New languages were developed in order to facilitate
exchange both ontology and data. Other languages dedicated for querying dat=
a at
the ontological level were proposed (e.g., RQL, SOQA-QL, or OntOQL). Various
approaches have been designed to deal with semantic integration of
heterogeneous information sources and system interoperability using ontolog=
ies
either in data sources or in mediators. In some domains, like products
modelling, ontologies were published as standards. These ontologies are
actually used to define worldwide exchange consortiums for sharing informat=
ion
in various application domains. Due to these recent developments, most
commercial database systems offer solution to both manage ontologies and da=
ta.
The objective of our workshop is to capitalize this effort. The aim of OAIS=
 is
twofold.
The first one is to present new and challenging issues in the contribution =
of
ontologies for designing high quality information systems. The second one i=
s to
present new research and technological developments that use ontologies all
over the life cycle of information systems.

A volume with workshop papers will be published by Springer in the Advances=
 in
Intelligent Systems and Computing series
(http://www.springer.com/series/11156), for distribution among workshop
participants during the workshop. Camera-ready papers are to be prepared in
LaTeX (detailed instructions will be provided).
The authors of the best workshop papers will be invited to prepare extended
versions of their papers after the workshop. Following an additional round =
of
reviews, the extended papers will appear in a special issue of Information
System Frontiers, Springer (Factor Impact =3D 0.761).
Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit=
 and
relevance to the workshop. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two Prog=
ram
Committee members. Duplicate submissions are not allowed, i.e. submitted pa=
pers
must not overlap substantially with any other papers of the same author(s)
submitted elsewhere (i.e. journal, conference, workshop etc.).
Workshop papers must not exceed 10 pages in the AISC format and must comply
with the AISC formatting guidelines available
athttp://www.springer.com/series/11156 (the link to "Instructions for Autho=
rs"
is at the right hand side). All papers (in PDF file format) should be submi=
tted
electronically via EasyChair Conference Management System. For details plea=
se
refer to submission instruction page.
