Final CALL FOR PAPERS (with submission deadline extension)
G21C Grapholinguistics in the 21st century=E2=80=94=46rom graphemes to =

<https://grafematik2020.sciencesconf.org>
June 17-18-19, 2020
Location: Auditorium Marie Curie, CNRS, D=C3=A9l=C3=A9gation =

************************************************

G21C (Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century) is a biennial conference
bringing together disciplines concerned with grapholinguistics and more
generally the study writing systems and their representation in written
communication. The conference aims to reflect on the current state of
research in the area, and on the role that writing and writing systems
play in neighboring disciplines like computer science and information
technology, communication, typography, psychology, and pedagogy. In
particular it aims to study the effect of the growing importance of
Unicode with regard to the future of reading and writing in human
societies. Reflecting the richness of perspectives on writing systems,
G21C is actively interdisciplinary, and welcomes proposals from
researchers from the fields of computer science and information
technology, linguistics, communication, pedagogy, psychology, history,
and the social sciences.

G21C aims to create a space for the discussion of the range of
approaches to writing systems, and specifically to bridge approaches in
linguistics, informatics, and other fields. It will provide a forum for
explorations in terminology, methodology, and theoretical approaches
relating to the delineation of an emerging interdisciplinary area of
research that intersects with intense activity in practical
implementations of writing systems.

The Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century 2020 Conference is kindly =
endorsed by ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and by ATypI =
(Association Typographique Internationale).

The first edition of G21C was held in Brest, France, on June 14-15,
2018. All presentations have been recorded and can be watched on
