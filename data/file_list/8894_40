CALL FOR PAPERS
Web2Touch 2014: Ontology Applications and Web
Semantics<http://web2touch2014.tudor.lu/>
Conference Track @ 23rd IEEE WETICE <http://cmt.dmi.unipr.it/wetice14>
June 23-25, 2014 - Parma - Italy
http://web2touch2014.tudor.lu

*Objectives*

The 2014 edition of the Web2Touch Track aims at presenting alternatives to
address interoperability and distributed knowledge management problem for
Web systems. Web is a living medium for collaborating where people and
computer systems can produce, share and consume information. However
several challenges for facilitating this collaboration are still open
issues, including: storage, retrieval, extraction, and visualisation of
huge quantity of information, interlinking, ontology classification and
fusion of data. New technologies and standards have been developed to
provide more efficient use of the Web, in particular for using Cloud,
Linked Open Data, and Big Data. The key of the success of the Internet is
the amount of published data available for everyone, but it also generates
problems to end-users. Researchers are continuously working to improve
Webapplications and
Web contents structures. The aim is to avoid overwhelming human beings with
irrelevant data, and to increase the capability of systems to correctly
interpret Web contents, so improving the quality of the interaction on the
Web. This Track is intended as a forum to discuss theories, models,
techniques and user requirements related to how a number of semantic
interoperability problems can be coped with to achieve commercial,
scientific, and sociological success for Web applications. Web2Touch is an
open forum for studies in multiples application domains including, for
example, Web science, eHealth, eGov, eLearning and collaborative systems in
general.

*Topics*

Include but are not limited to:
s        Case studies of social semantic web.
s        Ontology and knowledge reuse and integration.
s        Semantic web services.
s        Experiences in semantic web support for collaborative work and
business.
s        Knowledge creation, management, maintenance, and validation.
s        Collaborative ontology evolution and alignment.
s        Web for sentiment analysis.
s        Privacy issues in knowledge sharing.

*Important Dates*

s        Submission deadline: Feb 4, 2014
s        Notification of acceptance: March 14, 2014
s        Camera ready papers: April 11, 2014
s        Conference: June 23-25, 2014

*Paper Submission*

Papers submitted to W2T 2014 must be written in English and must be
formatted in strict accordance with the Wetice formatting instructions (author
kits and paper templates available for *Word*, *PDF*, and
*LaTeX*<http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html>)
and must be submitted in PDF format. Papers can be up to 6 pages. By
submitting a paper, authors commit to have the paper presented at the
workshop by at least one of them if the paper is accepted. Papers have to
be submitted through the easychair system:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=web2touch

The previous editions of Web2Touch received publication from many
countries, the accepted ones are available in the IEEE Xplore. The best
papers from 2008 to 2010 were published in special issues of the
International Journal of Web Portals (2011, vol 1 and 3) and extended
versions of selected papers from Web2Touch 2012 were published in
Concurrency and Computation (2013), Web Portals (2013) and Collaborative
Enterprise (2013) .
