The Data Mining and Machine Learning group (DM2L) at LIRIS laboratory 
(UMR 5205 CNRS, Lyon France) invites applications for a PhD position in 
Machine Learning.

Context

Nano 2017 is a new research and development programme specifically 
dedicated to nanotechnologies for superconductors in which one PhD 
student will be funded for 3 years. This research and industrial 
development program involves primarily STMicroelectronics and other 
local partners, including LIRIS, and aims to achieve, by 2017, a new 
technological breakthrough in the control and dissemination of 
nanoelectronics applications.

Semiconductor processes are currently pushed to the limits of the 
current technology, resulting in processes that have little or no margin 
for error. There is an Increasing need for fast, accurate, and sensitive 
detection and classification of equipment and process faults to maintain 
high process yields and high throughput in manufacturing. Early 
detection is critical to minimize scrap wafers and improve product 
yields for semiconductor manufacturing.

The PhD student will develop powerful machine learning algorithms for 
analyzing large unbalanced data sets including sensor data streams (at 
varying temporal resolution), selecting and extracting predictive 
features, assessing their relevance and performing early fault detection 
and classification in a supervised and/or semi-supervised context. The 
overall aim is to detect and classify faults faster and more accurately, 
resulting in improved process yields and higher throughput, while 
controlling the false alarm rate.


Work environment

Lyon is France’s second largest city and capital of the Rhône-Alpes 
region. Combining an exceptional historical heritage with a natural 
liking for good food, Lyon is an ideal city for discovering all the 
charm of the French way of life. A stage for more than 2000 years of 
history, the city has a remarkable architectural heritage. Expanding 
towards the east throughout the centuries, without destroying the 
existing areas, 500 hectares of its city centre became a Unesco World 
Heritage Site in 1998.

University Lyon 1 is one of the leading academic communities in France. 
Renowned for its leafy campus (443,000 m2), and state-of-the-art 
equipment, it enrols over 35, 000 students in approximately hundreds of 
study programs. University Lyon 1 employs 2630 researchers and teachers.

The Data Mining and Machine Learning group (DM2L) at LIRIS laboratory 
(UMR 5205 CNRS), focuses on the development of principled approaches to 
machine learning and data mining, and their applications to diverse 
areas including bioinformatics, anomaly detection, forecasting, process 
monitoring, medical diagnosis etc. DM2L currently consists of 12 
researchers and 10 PhD students.
