International IEEE Workshop on "BIG DATA meets CLOUD and VIRTUALIZED 
ENVIRONMENT" (BigCVEn'2014)

collocated with
The 10th International Conference on SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & 
INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS (SITIS 14)
November 23-27, 2014

Marrakesh, Morocco
http://www.sitis-conf.org/

There is a growing interest in virtualized environments and their 
applications, raising several challenges.
Many trends are emerging to address these issues. In this respect, Cloud 
computing provides a powerful model to connect users to information 
resources from anywhere in the world.
It has become a significant technology with several advantages including 
cost savings, access to greater computing resources, high availability, 
and scalability.
In addition, the advent of Semantic Web has raised new opportunities and 
challenges.
In this context, Big Data and Linked Data are being an integral part of 
the web infrastructure, where massive amounts of connected or possibly 
interconnectable data, adressable via URIs/IRIs, are available. These 
technologies are paving the way of the Web of Data.

The aim of the BigCVEn Workshop is to provide a forum to bring together 
scientists, researchers and practitioners interested in these emerging 
architectures and
methodologies for capturing, storing, managing and analyzing massive, 
dispersed, interconnected data over the Web. It also aims to discuss  
the connection and\or interaction
between Web of Data/Linked Data and Big Data/Cloud Computing.



The topics of interest of the track include, but not limited to:
- CLOUD COMPUTING/MOBILITY AND CLOUD
Cloud Computing standards and technologies
Cloud Computing specifications and enhancements
Cloud Computing discovery and integration
Cloud Computing, cluster and high performance computing and storage 
infrastructure for massive data
Cloud Computing security and QoS
Cloud Computing applications and solutions
Cloud and Social Network Analysis
Mobile Cloud Computing applications
Mobile cloud resource management
Mobile cloud middleware
Mobile cloud architecture
Energy efficiency in mobile cloud computing
Context-aware mobile cloud computing

- BIG DATA
Large big data stream processing
Scalability in processing large data volumes
Multiple source data processing and integration for massive data
Massive Data Visualization
Big Data and Social Medias Big Data issues in Bioinformatics, 
Cheminformatics and hydroinformatics
Use cases, Practical application of big data techniques
Mobile data analytics

- WEB OF DATA, LINKED DATA/OBJECT
Publishing Linked Data and Data Interlinking
Large Scale Ontologies Matching and Mapping
Instances Matching and Semantic Interoperability
Linked Open Services
Linked Open Data Cloud
Linked Data Science
Government Linked Data

- WEB SERVICES, Virtualized systems and Applications
Web application development on virtualized infrastructures and platform
Web information handling on virtualized storage
Web applications on Cloud infrastructure Virtualized RDF data indexing 
and storage
Virtualized Systems security, privacy, and trust
Data management and mining in social Web
Web advertising and community analysis
Web-based collaboration
Web service and information management
Virtual communities on the cloud
