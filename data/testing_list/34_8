Scope

The LNCS journal Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and 
Knowledge-Centered Systems focuses on data management, knowledge 
discovery, and knowledge processing, which are core and hot topics in 
computer science. Since the 1990s, the Internet has become the main 
driving force behind applicational development in all domains. An 
increase in the demand for resource sharing across different sites 
connected through networks has led to an evolution of data- and 
knowledge-management systems from centralized systems to decentralized 
systems enabling large-scale distributed applications providing high 
scalability. Current decentralized systems still focus on data and 
knowledge as their main resource. Feasibility of these systems relies 
basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) techniques and the support of agent 
systems with scaling and decentralized control. Synergy between Grids, 
P2P systems, and agent technologies is the key to data- and 
knowledge-centered systems in large-scale environments.

The third edition of this journal will be focused on data and knowledge 
management in Grid and P2P Systems. The importance of these systems 
arises from their main characteristics: the autonomy and the dynamics of 
peers, the decentralization of control, and the effective and 
transparent sharing of large-scale distributed resources.

The main objective of this edition is to make visible original research 
contributions, to identify new issues, and to shape future directions.
