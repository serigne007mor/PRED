            Call for Papers - Globe 2008


First International Conference on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems
(within the Dexa Conference Cluster)
 
September 1-5, 2008, Turin, Italy

Conference URL:    http://www.dexa.org
                    or
                    http://www.irit.fr/globe2008

Proceedings

All accepted conference papers will be published in: LNCS - Lecture Notes
in Computer Science - Springer Verlag (http://www.springer.com/lncs).

Scope

Research topics such as Grid and Peer-to-Peer computing are relatively 
recent. They are important for scale distributed systems and 
applications that require effective management of voluminuos, 
distributed, and heteregeneous data. This importance comes out of 
characteristics offered by these systems: the autonomy and the 
dynamicity of peers, the decentralization of control, and the effective 
and transparent sharing of
large-scale distributed resources. Today, Grid and P2P systems open 
towards the management of large,
distributed, and hetergeneous data which raises new problems and 
presents new challenges.

The main objective of this international conference on Data Management 
in Grid and P2P Systems is to present the latest results in research and 
applications, to identify new issues, and to shape future directions.

Topics

Original papers preferably but not limited to the following topics
are welcome (all the topics are related to Grid ans P2P systems):

    * Data Storage and Management
    * Data Integration and Metadata Management
