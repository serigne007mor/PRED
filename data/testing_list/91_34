==========================================
Call for submission
3rd Computer Cooking Contest
An event of ICCBR 2010, July 19-22, Alessandria, Italy
==========================================

Dear all,

(Sorry for multiple receptions - please spread widely)

We would like to invite you to enter the 3rd Computer Cooking Contest,
to be in Alessandria, Italy, in July 2010.

This year, we have four challenges including an "open task" and a
special "Student Challenge".

For more information please see: http://computercookingcontest.net

 == What is the Computer Cooking Contest (CCC)? ==

Who says that only human beings can cook delicious meals? We aim to
teach our computers the haute cuisine and need you to step up to the
plate! Come to the International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning
(ICCBR'2010) in Alessandria and participate in the Computer Cooking
Contest (CCC)! Write your own software application for the live
competition. Show that your program is more creative than the average
cook. Let your computer's recipe creations be evaluated by a
professional cook and an international jury of scientists!

== Challenges ==

1. Main Challenge

As in the previous editions of the competition, the main challenge
involves answering queries that require the selection and possible
modification of a recipe for a single dish. For example “I would like
a fish fillet, but please avoid lemon and other citrus fruits.”

Systems must be able to reason about:
 - Ingredients
 - Types of ingredients
 - Type of dish
 - Provenance of a dish
 - Dietary practices: vegetarian, nut-free, no alcohol


2. Adaptation Challenge

The aim of the adaptation challenge is to focus on a specific
adaptation task. Given a recipe and a set of user constraints, the
system has to adapt the recipe. For example “I have retrieved the
Banana Butterfinger Cake recipe, but I have no sour cream or vanilla.
What should I do ?”


3. Open Challenge

The rule of the open challenge is quite simple: do what you want
(still with the initial case base) and impress us! The only evaluation
criterion for this challenge is the scientific originality of the
proposed contribution. The evaluation will rely on the peer review of
the paper, your presentation, and your demo during the contest. You
can present one specific aspect of a system as a candidate for the
open challenge.


4. Student Challenge

If you are a student (or student-led) team and you want to enter the
contest, you can focus on a specific task (e.g., natural language
processing of the query) and present your results during the contest.
A separate award will be given to the best student team. If you need
any additional information or material for this challenge, please
contact us (ccc@iccbr2010.com).
