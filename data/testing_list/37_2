First Announcement of the 13th Conference on: Artificial Intelligence in Me=
dicine
AIME 11, 2-6 July 2011
Bled, Slovenia
Web site: http://www.aimedicine.info/aime11/

The AIME 11 conference will be held in Bled, Slovenia starting from 02/07/1=
1. AIME 11 will be a unique opportunity to present and improve the internat=
ional state of the art of AI in biomedical research from both perspectives =
of methodology and application. AIME'2011 will include invited lectures, fu=
ll and short papers, tutorials, workshops, and a doctoral consortium. The m=
ain conference will include a session dedicated to application of AI method=
s in the day-to-day practice of health care. Please see the conference web =
site for details.

Program Committee Chair: Mor Peleg, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel
Local Organization Chair: Nada Lavrac, Jo=9Eef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana,=
 Slovenia
Doctoral Consortium Chair: Carlo Combi, University of Verona, Verona, Italy
Special Session on Applications Chairs: Ameen Abu-Hana, University of Amste=
rdam, the Netherlands and Steen Andreassen, Aalborg University, Denmark

1) INVITED SPEAKERS

We are happy to announce our keynote speakers:
Manfred Reichert, Institute of Databases and Information Systems, Universit=
y of Ulm, Germany
Andrey Rzhetsky, Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Illin=
ois, USA

2) CALL FOR PAPERS

Contact: Mor Peleg (morpeleg@mis.hevra.haifa.ac.il)

IMPORTANT DATES

27 January 2011         Abstract Submission deadline
3 February 2011          Paper Submission deadline
4 April 2011                Notification of acceptance
22 April 2011             Camera-ready papers deadline
02-06 July 2011          AIME 07 Scientific Sessions
=20
Original long and short papers are sought on the development of theory, tec=
hniques, systems, and applications of AI in Medicine, including the exploit=
ation of AI approaches to healthcare organizational aspects, and to molecul=
ar medicine. Contributions to theory may include presentation or analysis o=
f the properties of novel AI methodologies potentially useful to solve medi=
cal problems.
Papers on techniques and methodologies should describe the development or t=
he extension of AI methods and their implementation, and discuss the assump=
tions and limitations of the proposed methods and their novelty with respec=
t to the state of the art. Papers addressing systems should describe the re=
quirements, design and implementation of new AI-inspired tools and systems,=
 and discuss their applicability in the medical field. Application papers s=
hould describe the implementation of AI systems to solve significant medica=
l problems, and should present sufficient information to allow evaluation o=
f the practical benefits of the system.

The scope of the conference includes topics such as: Knowledge Acquisition =
and Management, Machine Learning, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Biom=
edical Ontologies and Terminologies, Decision Support Systems, Neural Netwo=
rks and Belief Networks, Reasoning under Uncertainty, Temporal and Spatial =
Representation and Reasoning, Case-Based Reasoning, Planning and Scheduling=
, Protocols and Guidelines, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Generat=
ion and Understanding, Biomedical Computer Vision, Imaging, and Signal Inte=
rpretation, Intelligent Agents, Telemedicine and Cooperative Systems, Cogni=
tive Modeling, Healthcare Process Management

3) CALL FOR PAPERS FOR SPECIAL SESSION ON APPLICATIONS OF AI METHODS
=20
Contact: Ameen Abu-Hana (a.abu-hanna@amc.uva.nl) and Steen Andreassen (sa@h=
st.aau.dk)

Much of the literature on AI in Medicine pertains to the question =93Does t=
he system work?=94 while the questions =93Does it help?=94 and =93Why it su=
cceeds or fails?=94 receive far less attention. This session is dedicated t=
o two kinds of papers addressing these latter two questions. In particular =
the two types of papers are sought: papers on substantial fielded applicati=
ons that improve clinical care and papers on important lessons learned by r=
esearch teams developing and implementing applications or series of applica=
tions in clinical practice.

Authors should specifically submit to this track (the submission system wil=
l provide a way to indicate this). Only long papers should be submitted in =
order to adequately assess their merit. The length and layout of the papers=
 in the track is exactly the same as any other AIME paper. The papers are i=
nitially reviewed for this track by the session organizers. Dates for notif=
ication are the same as for papers for papers in the regular track. Papers =
in this session, like the other AIME papers, are eligible for selection in =
the planned journal special issue.

4) CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS

Contact: Mor Peleg (morpeleg@mis.hevra.haifa.ac.il)

IMPORTANT DATES
27 January 2011         Deadline for proposals
10 February 2011       Notification of acceptance
22 April 2011              Camera-ready materials
02 Jul 2011                  Tutorials at AIME 07
06 Jul 2011                  Workshops at AIME 07

Workshops will address selected technical topics. They should have an infor=
mal atmosphere and will last for half or a whole day with ample time allott=
ed for general discussion. A workshop will typically attract 20 to 40 parti=
cipants. Tutorials focus on topics relating to theoretical and applied aspe=
cts of AI in medicine. They will last for 4 hours and will typically attrac=
t up to 20 participants.

5) CALL FOR DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM SUBMISSIONS

Contact: Carlo Combi (carlo.combi@univr.it)

IMPORTANT DATES
07 March 2011             Paper submission deadline
08 April 2011               Notification of acceptance
22 April  2011              Camera-ready papers deadline
02 July 2011                 Doctoral Consortium at AIME 11

The aim of the AIME 2011 Doctoral Consortium is to support the research don=
e by doctoral students with constructive remarks and feedback from prominen=
t scientists in the AIM field. The DC provides a forum for students to pres=
ent their current research and receive feedback from other students and sen=
ior researchers; It facilitates networking among Ph.D. students and senior =
researchers working in the same area; and it supports students with informa=
tion on academic, research, and industrial careers.
=20
The event will be an =91advice-giving=92 session rather than an opportunity=
 for doctoral students to present finished work. The focus will be on the e=
arly stages of the PhD work. Therefore the consortium will elicit submissio=
ns consisting of work plans rather than "papers". The number of selected pa=
pers is limited to only 6. The event will include a tutorial which will be =
of common interest.
