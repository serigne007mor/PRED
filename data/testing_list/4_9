			Book Title: Emergent Web Intelligence

                        To be published by Springer Verlag

             in the series "Studies in Computational Intelligence"
                   http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/DBconf/Springer/
####################################################################################


Description
------------

The current Internet changes our daily life by redefining the
meanings and processes of business, commerce, marketing, finance,
publishing, education, research, etc. and by revolutionizing the way we
produce, store, process, retrieve and use information. Although
individual Web-based information systems are regularly being deployed,
new efficient techniques and approaches for developing and for
benefiting from collective Web intelligence are required more than ever
to help users avoid irrelevant web search results (pages, links, etc.),
fraud e-business transactions, non-personalized web information, even
wrong web decisions, etc.

The novel intelligent web theory exploits advanced information
technology and IA to explore the next generation of web-empowered
systems, services, and environments, and to design and provide hybrid
web systems that serve wired and wireless users more efficiently.

       In this book, we aim at gathering the latest advances of various
topics in web intelligence and reporting how organizations can gain
competitive advantages by applying the different emergent techniques in
the real-world scenarios. Papers and studies which couple the
intelligence techniques and theories with specific web technology
problems are cordially invited. Survey articles that emphasize the
research and application of web intelligence in a particular domain are
greatly welcome.

About the series "Studies in Computational Intelligence"
---------------------------------------------------------

The series "Studies in Computational Intelligence" (SCI) publishes new
developments and advances in the various areas of computational
intelligence. The intent is to cover the theory, applications, and design
methods of computational intelligence, as embedded in the fields of engineering,
computer science, physics and life science, as well as the methodologies behind
them. The series contains monographs, lecture notes and edited volumes
in computational intelligence spanning the areas of neural networks,
connectionist systems, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation,
artificial intelligence, cellular automata, self-organizing systems,
soft computing, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems. Critical
to both contributors and readers are the short publication time and
world-wide distribution - this permits a rapid and broad dissemination
of research results. For more details, go through
http://www.springer.com/series/7092.
