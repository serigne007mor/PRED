**********************************************************************
6th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing (ICSOC'08) 
Sydney, Australia, December 1-5, 2008

http://icsoc.org/

Abstract submission: June 1, 2008 11:59pm, PST
Paper submission: June 8, 2008 11:59pm, PST
**********************************************************************


CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS
--------------------------
Service oriented computing is an emerging cross-disciplinary paradigm for distributed computing that is changing the way software applications are designed, architected, delivered and consumed.

ICSOC’08 builds on the success of previous conferences in this series, establishing bridges between established and new service research and applications communities and fostering cross-community scientific excellence. Our goal is to bring together ideas and technologies from many different fields in an evolutionary manner, to address research challenges such as service composition, discovery, integration, monitoring and management of services, service quality and security, methodologies for supporting service development, governance in their evolution, as well as their overall life-cycle management. This year, we are focusing on building bridges with the business community because of its ongoing contribution to the emerging field of Services Science. 

ICSOC’08 seeks original papers in the field of service oriented computing, from theoretical and foundational results to empirical evaluations as well as practical and industrial experiences, with the emphasis on results that contribute to solving the many still open research problems that are of significant importance to the field of service oriented applications. Topics include but are not limited to the following: 

 - Services Foundations
 - Business Service Modelling
 - Integrating Systems of Systems using Services
 - Service Engineering
 - Service Assembly
 - Service Management
 - SOA Runtime
 - Quality of Service
 - Service Applications (Grid, E-science, Government, etc.)
 - Business and Economical Aspects of Services

CALL FOR INDUSTRIAL PAPERS
------------------------------
ICSOC 2008 solicits submissions covering the state of practice and real-world experience in service-oriented computing, including papers that describe innovative service-based implementations, novel applications of service-oriented technology, and insights and improvements to the state-of-practice. Case studies from practitioners emphasizing applications, service technology, system deployment, organizational ramifications, or business impact are especially welcome. 

The industrial track focuses on real world and really working implementations that are either near or already in production. Additionally, the industrial track welcomes detailed software product architecture and implementation discussions on products that are near release or already released. 

As the goal of the industrial track is to show the state of the art in applying service-based technology, papers must provide sufficient details on the application domain, and the service-oriented techniques used, the issues surrounding actual implementations and applications, and the lessons learned in the field. 

DEMONSTRATIONS, TUTORIALS, PANELS and PHD SYMPOSIUM
----------------------------------------------------------
Submissions are also invited for:

 - System demonstrations to showcase innovative implementation approaches, technologies and tools related to service-oriented computing;
 - Tutorials to disseminate state-of-the-art knowledge in fields related to the topics of the conference;
 - ICSOC 2008 seeks for panel sessions. The panels should be related to the topics of the conference needing discussions with the community. 
 - PhD Symposium, where PhD candidates will have the opportunity to get in touch with experts in their research areas and to obtain early feedback on their research results.

For further details, specific calls for each of the above activities are going to be disseminated through the main mailing lists soon; they are also available online on the conference web site.

FORMATTING, SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION
--------------------------------------
Formatting guidelines (Research Papers)
---------------------------------------
Prospective authors must submit an abstract prior to submitting their full paper – this abstract will be used in matching reviewers with papers. Research papers should describe innovative and significant original research relevant to ICSOC as described above. Papers submitted for consideration must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the duration of consideration. 

All papers must be prepared in accordance with the Springer/LNCS camera-ready format and be submitted electronically (in PDF) via the conference web site. Research papers are not to exceed 15 pages, including all references and figures. All submissions should include title, authors, and full contact information. Detailed instructions for authors are available on the LNCS website: http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0&teaserId=45515&CENTER_ID=99829

Submission
----------
Submissions should indicate the scientific area that best fits the content of the paper. 

Research papers and Industrial papers submissions must be done using the conference management tool before the specified deadlines using the following link: http://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/icsoc08/servlet/Conference. 

Demonstrations must be submitted electronically via e-mail at this address: demo@icsoc.org. 

For the PhD Symposium, submissions must be done using the symposium managment tool: http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=icsocphdsym08.

Evaluation
----------
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference. 

All accepted papers will appear in the ICSOC’08 proceedings (pending request), published by Springer Verlag as a part of its Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (http://www.springer.com/dal/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=1-164-7-72376-0). At least one author of the paper is expected to present the results at the ICSOC’08 conference. Selected papers will be invited for a special section of STTT (Int. Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer).
